right
brothers
stronger than kinship
they were close
when vasily got married
miao qingshan was his bestman
and wanted out to see his newborn daughter
and his wife took their daughter
away from guangdong
miao qingshan arranged it in a way
his people took photos or send gift from time to time
but be wont
miao qingshan said
tied to vasilys soul
vasily had no way to contact his daughter
but
vasily definitely did not take part in the train robbery
please dont arrest him for that
contact the task force
see if they can locate liu yuhus daughter

he came up with such a cute idea

how much does he love his daughter
for him to come up with such a funny way

its the sunshine after heavy rain
its the trip a drop of water takes
the angle between sunshine and the ground equals theta
go through the water drop at last
the direction it goes slightly changes again
the light deflected 42 degrees
why are there seven colors in rainbows
sunshine has painted the world
in a warm white
the white consists of
red orange yellow green blue indigo and purple
its going through the air
and enter the face of water drop
the direction might be deflected
youve been discussing for so long
newton said
light is particle
huygens said light is wave
einstein said no no no
light is particle
and light is wave
light is not particle
not particle
nor the wave
this is the waveparticle duality of light
newton said light is particle
huygens said light is wave
light brings warm and happiness
it shines on flowers
it shines on us
every straw
straw
every straw
great
we can call ourselves
team straw in the breeze
we dance when we meet the breeze
dont have the time to bother
we are just like straws in the field
we grow up freely and wildly
make a pact
to be happy together
and to grow up together
simple and easy
weve been lectured together
weve run loops and been punished together
whos the monkey king
its me
whos the little sea maid
its me
important to one another
we make a fuss together
together
we are straws
we are all great
we pick the stars even with muddy hands
we are together
even if we fall
we are straws
we are happy silly people
we are all great
we are very small but extra strong
get ready for the breeze

we can go and check ourselves because you can fly
we can run forward and laugh
theres light ahead
we can run forward and laugh
theres light ahead
ive passed

somebody said shes bro huas wife
because bro hua is from some rural area

bro dog

and why was he dancing after all
how should i know
have you ever thought about
and why was he started dancing
thats right what
you knew
the other day in my store
asked me the same question
but i couldve guessed
in ancient times
our ancestors went back home after a tired long day
they lived in caves
it was really dark
somebody set up a bonfire
everyone circled the bonfire
then
it was a night like tonight
in the night breeze
under the shining stars
they kept each other warm
they feared the darkness no more
after all
after all
human being is quite fragile

one of my friends once said
we can lose in a happier way

those students with poor grades
dont they deserve to shine
we can just be happy salted fish

hurry up and get dressed
adnan
wake your dad up
dad
you promised to take me to the mall
come on now mom will get pissed
adnan whats wrong
adnan
when a woman loses her husband she actually loses her lover partner
amen
the light of this house is extinguished and it is draped in darkness
dear god give him a better home than this home
sister nawal dear sisters
a widow is obliged before god
to safeguard her husbands reputation and honor
but if you have duties or responsibilities
then you may leave the house to do them
after the wake is over
she stays with feryal after school as usual
bring her over whenever you want im available
thank you dear i know youre always there
my sweetheart
these are the pajamas adnan had on
you are strong and pious
this is gods will right
hello rifqi come in
they will eat later
come in please come in
no
is everyone coming tomorrow
yes
will dad be upset if i missed school
no
finish your dinner
did dad die or pass away
dying and passing away are the same thing
why
because he got tired
nora
wake up were late
im up
are you done get ready
one minute
im ready
alright
well done for getting ready quickly
tie up your laces
how did dad teach you
dont move
watch how i tie it
heres the pickup
of water scarcity in jordan
which is an issue that neither previous nor current government were able to
may he rest in peace dear
my heartfelt condolences
thank you
you have to be strong
if you need anything were here for you
i was worried that youd ask for more days off
its been three days and she wont let anyone bathe her but you
how are you gorgeous
whats up dear
did you miss me
how are you nawal
thank you
i wanted to call you
but i felt it might be inappropriate
no worries
how are you gorgeous
if you need anything im here for you you know that
enough with your shy attitude im serious
weve known each other for over four years now
i told you a million times even if your dad and i approve
the church will not approve they need a compelling reason
not now for gods sake
all men like to play around
even bill clinton cheated on his wife
what did she do nothing
and there she is a respectable lady appreciated by everyone
just for your sake and to keep this family intact
this isnt a compelling reason for the priest
you need witnesses smartass
what better proof do you want mom
whats so funny
its legal here
this way i wouldnt have displeased the church or caused you a scandal
forget about her food for now
theres a key to every man
am i married to a human or a lock
why make it difficult hes a player with or without a key
that god will guide him and what if god doesnt guide him
id never live like my mom
its better than spending the rest of your life alone
oh i wish i was the bag
my love
youre late
your brother tried calling you several times
he said youre not picking up
ok ill call him now
 thanks feryal  take care
i cant hear you

 thank god im fine  thank god
if you need anything im here
consider it my responsibility
thank you rifqi
were all family and we will all help
yes
lets recite the quran every monday
this came as a shock
coffee
no who told you that
go sit over there
adnan told me because there are 4 instalments
what instalments
regarding the pickup
adnan still owes me 4 instalments
he never mentioned it
but im in a financially tight situation
no i didnt mean
but
why werent his employers paying him
he never mentioned it
dont worry about it
ill find a buyer for the pickup soon well sell it
ill take my payments and distribute the rest among the inheritors
dont worry ill manage
you dont know how to drive
anyways everything will be clear after the inheritance paperwork
just the apartment and the pickup
youre his brother the closest person to him
was from my inheritance from my late father
the monthly instalments were settled from both our salaries
of course sister
then why isnt the apartment in your name
because the mortgage was made against his employment contract
can i see the agreement adnans lawyer did
and please get the family record book
ok
adnan swore that he did it and signed it
just like that youll sign it and solve the problem
this whole document is useless without the official stamps
what should i do now
hurry up nora
yes mrs souad
im on my way
nawal
ok sure
the traffic in amman is becoming unbearable
come on move
ahmad told me about the agreement
in regard to what
the pickup instalments
our esteemed lady colette
the efforts sacrifices and love that you have given us…
im a week late
do you think im pregnant
have you tested
no
im not ready
maybe thats the solution
i dont even feel i have a maternal instinct
or the desire to give birth
no one is born with this feeling
it grows on you after you have a child
because i liked him
and wants to have sex with him
the only solution is to marry him
and getting married means having children
so in order to have sex you should get stuck in this vortex
lauren
it makes a loud explosion
spongebob
he wished he could drive
whys the place such a mess
hello
i took the keys from feryal
ive been calling you all morning why arent you answering
then go tell him that
 welcome rifqi  hi nawal
uncle wants to kill the mouse
but we clean the apartment every day
your uncle doesnt mean that our home is dirty
if adnan was alive he would have saved me from this rut
this is why i suggested selling the pickup
ok as you wish
the pickup issue is clear now
ill sort it out and pay you back
i finalized the inheritance document today
my sisters and i inherit half the apartment
i found the agreement but adnan forgot to sign
that means there is no contract
im not lying to you
besides how would you like me to divide the apartment
calm down
im just trying to explain the situation to you
this is our right and this is how things work
i suggest selling the apartment you settle the instalments
and we then distribute the shares
what if i had a boy
nawal please no need for this attitude
we all have our problems and we all want them resolved
if you have another solution please spit it out
we have nowhere else to live
where will we go
my dear sisterinlaw im still here for you
listen up
 calm down calm down  sit properly
calm down were family
well definitely find a solution
i could easily leave the house that i am renting
and move here with my wife and children
turn off the tv
mom
when i was a child i feared nothing
because everyone is afraid of them
but theyre small and harmless
and they carry diseases and theyre disgusting
and stop blabbering
come on sleep
can you unlock this phone
yes why
did you forget the password
yes
the number is registered under your name
no my husbands
what do you mean i stole it
second i dont need trouble
alright your first excuse was sufficient thanks
youre welcome
may adnan rest in peace
thank you
im here to ask about adnans last salary and social security
adnan left us over 4 months ago
we dont owe him anything
four months
actually maam he left on bad terms
and since then we lost contact
with all honesty he was tired lately and had health issues
we can raise some funds i can ask his colleagues to contribute
no no need
i just want his social security and tax documents
why are you staring at me like this and leaving aunt colette alone
are you drinking cinnamon
since we live in the middle ages in this country
abortion pills are forbidden
so its confirmed
why should your baby pay the price
i dont want a baby that resembles him
nawal
nawal
thats not possible
and you dont answer my messages
 im his wife  can you please sign here
whats that
thank you
what a shame
did you inherit any cash
fine
fine
ill tell the judge that hes throwing us on the streets
keep the door shut
no no
no i wont argue with anyone
i wont argue with anyone
ill just calmly tell him what happened
bye
he wants to sell the apartment to get cash
can you afford to rent
so we wont disturb mr mouse
here
 no thanks  come on
thank you
thanks for that
youre a widow with a daughter
no one can talk some sense into rifqi
finish your sandwich nora
when is the court hearing
tomorrow
hes definitely in a hurry
have faith in god
he will guide you
and hopefully god will send you a sign of relief
um nora
im not the only late one
trust in god
you can live with me until i find you a decent husband
 good morning  good morning rifqi
good morning um nora
the assets are clear
anyone has more information they would like to add
and you still have 4 instalments to pay
or debts i missed mentioning
if not then this should be fairly straightforward
in fact your honor
my husband borrowed from me my inheritance
and my gold dowry
which we used as the down payment for the apartment
no i dont
that the deceased borrowed money from his wife
he used to manage his affairs by himself
in other words they are responsible before god and the public
for taking care of the wife and her children
what responsibility your honor
he wants to sell our home to cash out his share
but he is obliged to support your daughter
your honor can we talk in private
go ahead
sir im pregnant
anyway this is the jurisdiction of the sharia court
take a pregnancy test and show them the result
please call back rifqi khalaf case number 47
who passed away on 21 february 2019
1 an apartment worth 30000 jordanian dinars
owed to his brother rifqi mansour khalaf
we have decided to postpone the request for distribution of the inheritance
yes true
but your responsibilities increased since my late brother died
certainly
but everyone should mind their own business
and her mother doesnt pick up the phone
nawal im not here to make trouble
nora is always welcome at my place
we also have rights too just like you
why should my sisters be deprived of their brothers inheritance
but theyre both married and have their houses
and inshallah you will give birth to a boy
 two or 3 more months  no i cant wait that long
did you even ask yourself who paid for the burial and wake
im okay
listen
what is it
trust in god the child comes and his sustenance comes with him
eventually in 2 or 3 months
it will be obvious
i can’t help you
this will get us both in trouble
hello honey
come in
i wish youd brought more meat
not at all
no trouble at all
whats wrong with her visiting her uncle
nawal for gods sake give me a break from all this
come on go to your room get going
come on clear this room
no grumbling
dont bother im leaving
go on get up
to sell our home hell take her for good
in a couple of days
alright
 you wont get much for it  i dont care
ill sort out the remaining instalments later
come in
nawal im glad you arrived
movers are getting furniture
step one empty the water in the toilet
invite a pregnant friend of yours over and offer her all sorts of liquids
how to forge a pregnancy test
uncle rifqi told me im going to have a brother
get inside
we dont know yet
but look
until then we wont tell anyone
its our secret deal
why are you watching tv now
i want to play after dinner
can we go to mcdonalds
its late already and i cant drive the car
i promise you well go next week
besides i cant enter the kitchen alone
excuse me mrs souad
im so embarrassed to ask but
i have lots of commitments and i need an advanced payment
if possible
why do you need it
ok dear ill talk to laurens father when he returns
but the salary is his responsibility
ok thanks
nawal
when will you reply to my messages
or should i give up
youre out of charge
nothing
arent we friends
dont worry
besides were colleagues not friends
i thought we were more than that
i know what youre going through isnt easy
thats why i keep checking on you
i dont want anything from you
its just that
you can tell me
everything is new to me
my entire life is in turmoil everything is new to me
a new problem pops up every day and i must handle it
for example adnans pickup is blocking the buildings foyer
i can park it for you
thanks youre so kind
do you need anything
are you okay
i need your help
what favor
under my name
what for
i need to be pregnant
otherwise adnans family will confiscate the apartment
nora and i will be homeless
and i got a sign that im pregnant
by the way if you download any app
theres no way id do that
i mean
lying is a sin
sex is a sin
but every sin has a motive and a justification
i think that making you and your daughter homeless is the sin
ill help you
but i need your help too
i need you to find a doctor to give me an abortion
ok
you can always say you miscarried
i just need a positive test
oh i wish i was the purse
mom
whats this
 get your stuff quick  hi honey
how are you feryal
nora told me youre pregnant
but i didnt tell anyone by the quran no one
indeed
your brother passed by and dropped off empty boxes
what are these boxes for
are you moving out
you didnt answer me
are you selling his clothes
stop it
super nora
remove this damn thing
show me who taught you this silly game
all young girls play it it encourages them to like the hijab
calm down you shouldnt stress its bad for the baby
were you this nervous when pregnant with nora
i was shit leave me the fuck alone

does it hurt here
its ok

okay
fine
doctor
why wont you operate if theres a pulse
thank you nawal
take care of yourself
if you need anything just call me
take this
take it buy something for nora
we are all in the same shit
your honor she recently discovered her pregnancy
why was the test taken at a private lab
but no one told me
why didnt you inform the court about the
 no one told me  i wasnt sure back then
what debt are you talking about
four pickup instalments that she refuses to pay
i didnt refuse your honor this was a debt between him and his brother
answer the question
im answering dont interrupt me
he has nothing to do with it
i want you to answer the question when will you pay me
you have 2 options
 you can either pay him  how will she pay sir
her salary is barely sufficient and she works until midnight
which means she cant take a second job
youre not giving me a chance to breathe
since adnan passed away and you
quiet
give her a week
if she doesnt pay then you sell the pickup and close the debt
and the rest of the money will go
lets go do the damn test and be done with it
ok
heres 200 as agreed
 thank you  youre welcome
my name is samira

mom

rifqi khalaf
nora
im telling you rifqi took nora
a colleague who works at souads i was tired so he drove me home
i cant take this anymore theres a new problem every day
at this rate youre going to lose everything
 its all my fault  yes its your fault
the man has responsibilities many ends to meet
its not his problem that your husband was fired
just sell the damn pickup and pay him back
i sold my bedroom furniture to pay him
 im going to the police  thats all we need listen to me
listen to me you will stay here tonight
and i swear if you leave ill break your legs understood
there are a million widows out there some get remarried
hassan  physio
rifqi khalaf
give me nora
honey sweetheart
whats wrong why are you crying
im fine honey im fine
i promise
bye honey
who did this to her
get out
out
who gave you permission to go in and see her
who did that to her
its none of your business
did you stand by and watch silently
better than spending six months in prison after what you two did
did you think this would go by so smoothly
my stupid daughter
thinks that shes a superwoman
who can say and do whatever pleases
its your fault
you did this to her
i did this to her
get out
give me my money
shes waking up
 youre fine  youre fine
are you ok
are you um nora
yes
here
im not signing
sister you must sign it
im not signing
demanding custody of your daughter from your late husband
im sorry your honor but what did i do wrong
being out from morning to evening renders you unfit to raise the child
but i go to work your honor
because we needed my salary to pay the bills
 where do you work  in a house in amman
does it mean you leave the house to provide for your family
of course
my neighbor an old lady i pay her a monthly salary
and my daughter spends 3 hours after school at her place
no besides your honor is it ok that he picks her up from school
and keeps her at his place for two days without informing me her mother
and until now he didnt return her
and reminds me of my late brother spends time with her family
frankly your honor im worried about her mothers behavior
and still hasnt done the test requested by court
first the pregnancy issue is not within this jurisdiction
her mother is still the legal guardian
and you have no right to take the girl without informing her
also your reasons for claiming custody are weak
sister you need to pay attention to your behavior
whats wrong with you now you won today
what does he want
no we will do it now and get done with it move
how long before the test results are out
 what test  pregnancy test
 lets wait  im going home
im not your sister
nora
sweetheart i am here
let me see your face
say bye to your cousins before we leave
did rifqi leave the pickup promissory notes
wait

youre not answering my calls
heres the money you requested
im sorry hassan
nora
i wasnt late see
wait here honey
you are so rude

theres this stranger charming and tall
from ireland or was it england
and thanks to his dowsing skills and all
in love with archaeology was he
but he never married it and now he deals in contraband
whatever the ground offers up when they dig
theyve a connection with the underground
others are just victims
not everyone is capable of defying
the law the darkness and the souls of the dead
some people are scared of dying
nights on the lookout when danger is rife
its a thrilling and risky life
its the dream of redemption and wealth
whats the point of judging then

this is pakistans response
pakistan has agreed
that until talks take place
that means well have to accept
neither should you disagree
until the maharaja makes up his mind
dont say yes
dont say no
lord mountbatten
i wonder why
what a great parting gift theyve given us
they came to one country
hindustan and pakistan
hindus and muslims
sir
hazara
afridi
mahsud
even pakistan army soldiers
who were on leave
are crossing the border in truckloads
to attack srinagar
and you all knew about this
the cgs
the officiating dmo
and the defence minister
when were you planning to inform me
the intel wasnt solid kalkats report
major kalkat you tell me
operation gulmarg is a masterstroke sir
one solution to pakistans three problems
the pathanistan movement will be crushed
the tribals will get land for settlement
and kashmir will belong to pakistan
and youre sure
yes sir
pakistan commanderinchief general messervy
sent the operation plan to brigadier c p murray
they put me under house arrest
but i escaped
brigadier murray knew
but he still didnt inform us
yes but we need
maharaja hari singhs decision first
no
menon
leave for srinagar right away
and
yes
relay all this information
to srinagar airfield as well
i need all of this done in the next hour
sir
major
our pilot has informed us
that the srinagar airfield runway
so
for delhi before sunset
so we have only half an hour to do this
according to the latest reports
the armed tribal groups
have reached baramullah
only 35 miles away from srinagar
if they get to srinagar
and capture the airfield
maharaj
secretary vp menon and
while those plunderers are taking over kashmir
seems like ill have to handle this on my own
ill fight
ill fight with my army
your highness

youve come too late
this is my home
and to protect it
whether its mine or of my enemies
your highness
please come

you please handle the politics
as you are trained for it
your highness
please come
ill see you at the airfield mr menon

we wont be able to reach delhi
i can now see
why i was asked to take you along
whats the matter sam

my boss wont be happy
i had promised her
that id be back home by 7
and in any case
only your mission is accomplished
our mission will
begin only now
the indian army and air force
from poonch to draskargil
and what did i get
ill soon be cooking sitting inside a saucepan
this is akashvani and now the news
the indian national congress held
a special election in delhi
mrs indira gandhi
major general manekshaw
i must admit
thank you sir
what could be more reassuring for a defence minister
is in your able hands
right kaul
sir
thank you minister
which can make it better
of course sir
im sure we can greatly benefit
which front did you fight at
he may not have field experience
im sure
this way gentlemen
theres something else i wanted to ask you sam
i wanted your opinion
on a few officers
what do you think of general thimmayaa
please dont
today youre asking me about my chief
tomorrow youll ask
the armys discipline
is its very foundation
minister
so what if i dont have war experience
im his senior officer
and the chief of general staff
thats why hes jealous of me
and thats why he hates me
no no
sam doesnt hate anyone
he just loves himself more
the only problem is
that everyone else loves him too
especially pm nehru
we must do something sir
antinational
there are other serious charges too
an enquiry must be done kaul
but antinationalism
this letter such charges
youve seen his office right
its been 14 years since independence
but hes still loyal to the british
hes forgotten
that his seniors and ministers
are all indian
his biggest problem is
not one problem
theres a list of problems
but is this list
enough for an enquiry
not some junior officer or corporal
of course sir
and
impressive kaul
so its your field
and your rules
manekshaw residence
hello
hello
sehroo bhai
silloo whats the matter
no its nothing
just that inquiry
and sam
sam
you know him
ask him anything
im ok
antinational and you
sam
this kaul
hes always been jealous of you
professional disagreements are routine silloo
why would kaul have a personal problem with me
you think everyones good at heart
what if
what if they win sam
i already won
ill handle the other battles as well
im ok
and everything will be ok
soon
i promise
come inside
that batliwala
silloo
our daughter will become sherry batliwala
but this is too much
this court of inquiry has assembled
to investigate into the incidents of impropriety
military cross
that have been brought to the notice
everything alright
this isnt right sir
things will be alright
the first matter against
instead of indian leaders
yes its true
not politicians
the second charge is
violating the orders of your senior officer
wilful disobedience
that you received a letter from the office
that you deliberately ignored
you mean he was expecting
a response to that
my apologies
that i failed to send
an appropriate reply
let me correct that mistake right away
to complete the construction
but yes if he requires workers or labourers
i know a few contractors
perhaps they can also explain the difference to him
and what soldiers do
sir someone in the mess told me
no sir
no sir
major general manekshaw say
he doesnt want his officers
it is time to conclude
the findings of this court of inquiry
i agree general
we neednt waste any more time
major general sam hormusji framji jamshedji manekshaw
are unjustified
they are utterly baseless
and without any merit
this enquiry is
but i had told you
swami
very soon the sandwiches will have no filling at all
thats it
im banning fine china in the house
from now on well only use steel
ive been saying this for ages
filter coffee tastes better in steel mugs
and i also taught you
your filter coffee is far from authentic
and now an important announcement
after chinas attack on assam
prime minister pt jawaharlal nehru

chinese forces have been
aggressively attacking our borders
right now
enemy forces are at assams doorstep
we have lost bomdila as well

it cannot be tolerated anymore

the butcher
tikka was known as the butcher in ima
and now after the operation at dacca university
i guess hes become the butcher of bengal
this butcher
has murdered hundreds of people sam
in east pakistan
his soldiers are making people
dig their own graves before killing them
bengal assam and tripura
you will have to enter east pakistan sam
that would mean war
are you ready for war
because i am not
please agree mr shyam
april is coming to an end
the snow will start melting in the himalayan passes
and open the way for the chinese forces
in east pakistan the monsoon is about to arrive
with snow melting above
and the rains below
will be restricted
and they wont get air support either
as it was in 1962 defense minister
with being in such a position
but i certainly do
i dont want to lose
prime minister
now give me your orders
chief
please stay back
prime minister before you say anything further
i have a question for you
or tomorrow morning
what you just told us
is it true
telling you the truth is my duty
and i fight to win
prepare for war
only preparation
no immediate action
the war will begin on this day
whether we start it
or them
the refugees pose a human problem
and it has to be settled
on that basis
is a major factor
any initiative mr president
in solving the problem
and other related issues
the phone again
must be her again
what are you doing sam
breakfast prime minister
have breakfast with me today
prime minister
mr kissinger
ambassador keating
general manekshaw
that makes his intent very clear
about east pakistan
you know mr kissinger
there is this boy in rajivs class
who thinks it is his business
to stick his nose
into everyone elses business
but instead of going around
asking for help
i told rajiv
to restrain the powers in pakistan
with regard to this matter
nor i can do anything in this matter
this is a ridiculous situation
over a few refugees
mr kissinger
but the global repercussions
of any hostile action
taken by india
will be
tremendous
i have no other option
i will turn to general manekshaw
i would suggest
that you insist upon pakistan
to make conditions right
for those 7 million refugees
if you dont

maho
thank you
well thats all from me
i will now introduce some of the teachers
nice to meet you all
i am haruto higashiyama
which is one of the best preparatory schools in the area
where you can feel much closer to nature
and this city is also a land of many historically important sites
including the nitaka ruins
this town and nitaka high school is one of the
best places in japan where you can study while feeling close to history
as a japanese history teacher this place is a dream come true for me
i will be taking over 2nd year class c starting today
apart from that
we have also received permission to establish a new club activity called the ruins research club
i transferred to this school in order to get killed
i

these two battles are collectively called the mongol invasion
sorry ive got plans today
no way shes coming
ready to go home
recruiting new members
aoi

possible that it is a ceiling stone of a sidemouth stone burial chamber
placing the date in the 7th century
thats amazing aoi

this pattern is exactly like that
well theres a possibility that it was bartered and distributed
hey aoi could you be
sorry its nothing
youre wrong
alright
sorry about that mr ikushima
youre too loud
well since youre a man im sure you understand
i dont really know why you would look at your students that way

at a female student as a sex object
and so i reported it anonymously to the school board
i was then assigned to fill that vacancy
i love my pamela
your palema
no you see…
baby

yeah youve been shunned
youre ruining it with your breath
my breath
god this is crazy to see
look at this guy
oh my god
oh wow
come my angel take my hand
would you marry me again
yes
bye
bye guys
tonight june 1st
hearing the tone of my voice i was happy
when i saw those videos i got so emotional cause i thought
im looking for a feeling i cant find
whether shes racing across the sands of malibu in her red lifeguard suit
or posing on the cover of playboy
im pamela anderson miss february 1990
you do the playboy and baywatch
tommy pamela turn around
why do you think printed materials are so obsessed
that infamous sex tape stolen from their home
if theyve heard any of the tabloid rumors
it paints a whole idea of another person and who i am
so hopefully i can only surprise people
youre not an actress no
what are you i dont know yet
im here
im living in the house that i grew up in
okay good girl
and i always kinda know what im doing when i leave
its like the truth serum
you look at the stars
and everything comes to you
oh my god
believe me i cant run in slow motion on this beach
april 1st my dad would pick me out of bed
like happy april fools
and we had to swim april 1st and it is freezing here
it was a tiny little shack
but my dad was a poker player
my dad liked to race cars
and my mom has a scar across her whole forehead
because her head went through the windshield while pregnant with me
and we like to joke thats probably the reason im a little bit crazy
i love the island
living by the water
people are very friendly
ladysmith is a beautiful little town
and vancouver island is the place to be
pamela was born july 1st 67
she hit the paper the minute she was born
pam was the first centennial baby
pamela was always at the store
thatll be 50 for pamelas bill
and i says bill what bill
she says well she charges up chocolate bars here
and puts it on the tab
so they were just still raging
and my dad drank a lot
they fought quite a bit
my mom was vacuuming during a hockey game
i just kinda knew when to take my brother out
then wed come in and theyd be like up against the wall or on the table
just kissing or throwing themselves in the room slamming the door
felt like the same energy though
we ended up leaving my dad a couple times
there was mail by the phone
too many bad memories i guess for my mom
but i realized no one has a perfect childhood
i had a babysitter
and my parents thought she was a great babysitter
but she was molesting me
it was like three or four years of abuse
she always told me not to tell my parents
i tried to protect my brother from her
i tried to kill her
so i thought i killed her with my mind and i couldnt tell anybody
but i was sure that i did it that i wished her dead and she died
i lived with that my whole really young life
when those traumatic moments happen i would just leave my body
and float away and id make my own little world
i just thought i had to get off the island
i was a gymnast and so i was tiny
i bloomed very late
then i got one lump on my chest
then everything was like bam bam bam and then crazy from there
and now here we are
more than two lumps later
whats this
oh my god
i figured one day id get here
cause now im here surrounded by my stuff
i mean basically my life is all yellow legal pads
if something were to ever happen to me that thered be evidence
i was wondering
or what are you thinking about that
i dont even think ill watch this documentary
cause you go through it again like youre going through it for the first time
its… its painful
im glad i got this diary
it should really help
i love words
they send me leaving this ludicrous situation behind
come with me im paving the way
the world opens when i write
life keeps playing tricks on me
i try to find ways to be seen amongst the nonsense
some more than others
xo pamela
one of my first boyfriends
and i did a gymnastic dismount into a ditch
so… things that come in handy
and shed go its all attached dont go to the mainland
i went on the ferry and i got there and eventually i met somebody
i moved in with him
and he was having an affair with somebody
thats a sign that theyre probably having an affair
and i wrote down washing penis in the sink suspicious
my girlfriend had friends who were labatts beer representatives
bc lions canadian football
and i didnt even wanna go
and were all wearing the labatts beer tshirts
and i remember seeing it going oh my god thats me
and my friend that was with me worked for labatts
so i had to pick a number out of a bowl
like it was just huge and just…
not too long after that my phone rang and i picked it up
this woman says its marilyn grabowski from playboy
playboy
for this october 89 cover and we think it should be you
she goes its for real guaranteed
but id never been on a plane before
and i was like what
and i went to another airline
i get there and the same lady was there like this like nice try
so the only other way to get through get on a greyhound bus
it really made me nervous
so i got into america to seattle
off the plane big city la
i go straight to the guy holding the bunny sign
very lowkey
and i landed on gay pride day
so i called my mom and said
gay people exist they walk around handcuffed together in pink hot shorts
she goes… youve arrived
i thank him way too much for letting me sit up there
looks me up and down
im a mess
but she tells me theyre so happy im here
im lost in amazement
is that tony curtis was that scott baio and sean penn
and just beautiful women in long silk gowns
then another one comes out and chases her with a glass of champagne
wow gorgeous
i feel very average at this point
i was there in my acidwash jeans my nirvana tshirt
it looks like theyre going to have to color my hair
i got that sunin stuff
when i was young i was painfully shy
i hated my body
like why dont i look like that
and i always thought girls were beautiful and guys were beautiful in school
but i never thought i was one of them
so much shame about what had happened to me
i was 12 13yearsold with my friend
we went to a friends condo
she went upstairs with the guy she had a crush on
i started to play backgammon with her friend downstairs
i couldnt bear to hurt her more
i didnt tell her or anyone
i tried to forget it
like i really had this image of i had sex on my forehead
i think a lot of confusion
it made me super selfconscious
photo shoot
shy at first
to the side am i doing this right
and i was like… like thats where a wild woman was born
now i was gonna take the power of my own sexuality
and take my power back and i did it i think in a really big way
put my fingers in my mouth
and then my hair became my prop
i felt like this is something that im good at
not that im good at goodlooking but im good at it
but you are that person in that situation
and i thought okay i did it i did playboy
im going home
but the next day marilyn grabowski took me for lunch
she said that hefner really wanted me to be a playmate
i think you have a career here
be free
the price you pay for clean air
i like driving here
everybody seems to know where theyre going and want to get there fast
thats miles per hour
i got my new dog star today
hes going to be so loved
i moved to a little apartment i had one plate one fork one spoon
theres really no way i should be here
coming from a very isolated small town an alcoholic father
i lived in an imaginary world
i certainly dont blame my parents for my upbringing
im a survivor
xo pamela
well it used to be dont think we need more
no one needs to see my body anymore
my mom always talked about beauty hair makeup and all that stuff
five dollars for a box
i am real underneath it all
ive never sat across from an interview subject before and said
what are they who are they those things im just tagging along with
i always said my boobs had a career and i was just tagging along
no you dont wanna see them now theyre in rough shape
um…
whered i get my boobs done yeah
jesus thats a personal question but ill let you…
lets talk about this
you were not underendowed were you no
i mean this is just incredible
i remember when i was with kimberly hefner
and shes married to hefner
so that was it
choices in the moment
they werent that newsworthy
but i was just pretty naive
when someone asked me i said yeah
have you ever had work done
why yes these are implants larry
it was disturbing cause it was like oh my god really
is this what were talking about again
but you roll with it
yeah
those are beautiful uh jewelry
thank you
so much has been written…
who would you wanna be and why
i could be you
yeah thatd work
i think its kind of inappropriate to ask women those kind of questions
which would be more interesting to people
you know than my body
i moved here when i started working for playboy so everybody that ive met
and they called and said
would you come for an audition for baywatch
it was about the california dream
a weekly series about the brave men and women called lifeguards
they always tried to get me to come and audition in marina del rey
i was like that sounds really far i cant go i just ignored it
susie and i knew this was the girl and she canceled on us 11 times okay
by the eleventh… and we kept going into these auditions
they said are you pamela anderson like one famous never for showing up
and i said yes
and she just had so much energy
and so much uh personality
so thats how cj was born
and action
not as surprised as i was
how are you cj
hows larry
or if something wasnt working theyd say more seagulls
and he would be slingshotting like crackers in the air
scare the birds please scare those birds
when it comes to viewers
theres one show thats in a class all by itself
not that it really needs much translation
it wasnt really about the storylines
and when it came to eye candy no one was sweeter than pamela anderson
she turned slowmotion running into an art form
her magnetism just radiated
and we realized we had something in pamela that was different
going to europe to promote baywatch was crazy
my first guest became an international superstar
from her role on baywatch
pamela anderson
the very lovely pamela anderson
that is my dream
im going to work very hard to help that happen
whoo
ive always had this property and i abandoned it for like 25 years
so it was really rotten and decayed
to look after them
and then covid hit and i said okay im staying
darn it
then i got married christmas eve
but hes a good canadian guy normal
im like a spawning salmon just coming home to die
terrible
nineteenninety
i was like making a cake for marios 33rd birthday
thats a long time ago
january 8th 1990
why would i even write that down
cause god forbid you do a documentary one day in your life
i dated a few other actors but only for short periods of time
well just… well scott baio
oh off scotts dad for 5000
he was really mad because i would drive scotts mercedes
that i had to drive something like a hyundai
eric nies
december 18th 1992
we are finally off baywatch until may
its me
totally pamela
mitch i think im in love
oh no cj come on not again
you just met the guy
you say that every time
no this times different
i met kelly slater on the set of baywatch
he was my big love actually
oh theres kelly
when he had hair
so handsome
and lots of girlfriends for him too but it wasnt just me
my girlfriend and my friends
he definitely was a heartbreaker
but you dont own anybody
id rather have loved for an instant than a miserable life
i love being in love and being vulnerable and being giving
i love to live a romantic life every day
i remember talking to sylvester stallone one time
and i was like does that mean theres number two uhuh
he goes thats the best offer youre gonna get honey
youre in hollywood now
say hi
i was part owner of this club called sanctuary
tommy was there
mötley crüe drummer tommy lee
rocker tommy lee
the mötley crüe drummer with the badboy image
i gave everyone a goldschläger shot to celebrate
but tommy thought it was only for him so he came bounding over everybody
after that night the phone wouldnt stop ringing
and he was leaving messages saying
my bologna has a first name its large
but i was out the door one day when the phone rang
he goes hello i was like tommy
and he sounded really sad he goeshi
and i said no youre not coming to mexico
i was like no you cant come there
and i was like shit
and when i got there i told everybody
well were in cancun
unfreakingreal
that is where were going tonight la boom
its somewhere over there
and then tommy was leaving messages
im here with some buddies im going hotel by hotel to find you
what could possibly go wrong
i said we leave tomorrow
lets call him and lets have one night with these guys
so its like super techno
they all looked the same
and my girlfriend alexis she said that one
which id never tried before
you know i have light eyes and i thought it looked so cool
all a big happy blur
later on that night he just looked at me and he goes
you wanna get married and i was like yeah i do
and he goes okay
tommy and i couldnt stay away from each other
and from then on it was a fantasy my fantasy
now i finally like you enough to get married
whoo were getting married today
i know what do you think about that
awesome
and so after a few days together in cancun we got married
hey lovely girl
were our wedding party
my maid of honor was somebody that we met in the club that night
we were lying in lawn chairs sipping chi chis
im the luckiest girl on the planet
my beautiful husband
whats your problem
little baby coronitas
and i remember asking whats our last name
he goes no thats somebody else
baby doll
i got your booty
hey gorgeous
thats my baby
look at those toes
all sandies
no no no i like it
no leave it
bye cancun
and then from the plane back to la i remember going to tommy
do you eat eggs
and it ended up being one of the wildest most beautiful love affairs ever
we landed to so much paparazzi
it was crazy
everyone was in shock
theyre in newlywed bliss
some have said that marriage to pamela anderson
soon soon soon we wanna have babies yes
were moving in today
whose are you
get up sleepy
im recording the whole thing
we always had these camcorders
then you fill the tape and put the tape away and label it
but those were moments im glad we captured
when are you gonna get me preggos
and we went there to announce that we were going to do barb wire
barb wire was the only real movie role i had
asking articulate questions about the art of moviemaking
that wasnt the case at pamelas though
are you trying to get pregnant
well how many do we want baby two or three
two yeah but were working on it
but after the cannes film festival
they changed everything because they thought this is gonna be huge
so they switched directors and they switched storylines
and i dont even know what that movies about
i have no idea
and action
i had the bwv the barb wire voice
i really just tried to talk very low
dont call me babe
i was like oh god that sounds terrible
i was shooting all the time i was shooting baywatch during the day
tommy and i found out that i was pregnant
we just were so excited
how cute
and… and take up my time
and you still have to work 18 hours a day
there they are hard at work
i just feel fortunate im doing a movie in my career so…
i mean id like to do more projects
im so excited about my career
im wanting it more now
and you know you can really only work so hard
she came in and she looked horrible
she was pale and shaking so bad
we just were completely devastated
because we really wanted to start a family
when we were leaving the hospital paparazzi were following us
and then i slam the door open
and tommys putting his boot through the windshield
it was crazy
we were just like everybody stay away from us
well i had a miscarriage
barb wire did not do well it didnt do well no
so in many ways your first failure
it wasnt the box office hit everyone imagined
but after the miscarriage i wasnt really thinking about barb wire
im so depressed
i just did what was in front of me to numb the pain
i never got to deal with the grief of losing my first baby
im devastated
halloween party this was before dylan
this is… thats uh tommys 37th
lets push play okay i guess
merry christmas
merry christmas
whoa a doubledecker
i have that shot so many times
i just paid which is um…
well thats good water
videotape me preggos you havent videotaped my preggo belly
we got pregnant again
i was so happy
my wife looks like shes having just a wonderful time
todays not a good day i feel sick
no filming pamela on those days
tommy
he is love sex rock and roll
sweet
dont forget talented romantic
and a bad drunk
crown me
we are reckless and hopeful
and may just have a unique way of living thats right for us
fish and chips with vinegar
what do i do with these put them over your boobies
whoa baby
i love you
bye
baby look what you did to me
march 20th 1996
i wonder how our life will be
i cant wait to play with our little baby
dads already drinking beer
thats me
i have a little person inside of me depending on me
go film the paparazzis they were all around our house
thats insane
yeah it was awful
someones gonna be a daddy in a couple days
were having brandon tonight
june 1st
im aching with excitement
is he coming baby
in our bedroom
hey momma
hi baby
congratulations
baby we made a burrito
seventeen hours of natural labor
hi brandon
its daddy and mommy
baby youre a daddy
its a whole new life now
he was born at 305
302 i think
but we didnt realize everything was about to change
okay say bye guys
bye
were slowly getting it done
the koi pond
i had all the corks from every champagne bottle saved in there
hey your radness
we were in the house one day
and tommy went to get something out of the safe
like who whered you put the safe
and he was looking at my assistant john roberts at the time
and john was like what are you crazy i have no idea
we filed a police report
but nothing happened
because we had construction going on at our house for quite a while
it couldve been stolen in a sixmonth time period
was gonna be something that would hurt us
but then one day we got something in the mail
it was wrapped in brown paper
it was a vhs tape
oh my god
i love you tommy
i love you
talented man
wheres daddy
but we had no idea who sent the tape
here we go caught on tape
if anyone steals this tape youre going to hell
brandon
not too long after that…
…we got a letter from bob guccione from penthouse
he offered to buy it from us
he said ill give you five million in cash for the rights to this tape
we said fuck you give us our tapes back
this was not supposed to be for anybody else
couple weeks later tommy watched the news and he came up and goes
he told me that theres this girl at tower records impersonating me
we saw it all over the tabloids the newspapers
the tape is out
such an invasion
were angry and hurt and upset
do you have any remorse for exploiting celebrity or noncelebrity lives
there was paparazzi everywhere
it was our first night out after i had brandon
my parents were watching brandon
hey fuck outta here
fuck off
tommy get in
then we got pepper sprayed
we didnt spray anything
how dare you do that to me
because this was stolen out of our home
and then sell it in front of the whole world
a tape was stolen from tommy lee and myself
and we said sure
theres no question of that
its been exploited all over the world
and everyones making money off it
i really feel that… that well… well get them
that pam and tommy turned down five million dollars cash
they didnt wanna release that tape
i will continue to fight not only for myself and my children
but also for legislation that would make what theyre doing to me a crime
when the deposition started i was pregnant again
and i remember walking into the room
youre in playboy you have no right to privacy
and that was a little bit shocking but…
they would ask about my sex life
how am i getting questioned about my sexuality
it made me feel like i was such a horrible woman
im just a piece of meat
theyre all oh shes in playboy she likes being naked in public
playboy was empowering for me
but in this case it felt like a rape
not to bring up something really heavy from my childhood
but when i was attacked by this guy i thought everybody would know
when the tape was stolen it felt like that
and the depositions were so brutal
why do these grown men hate me so much
but they wanted me to come back and come back
but im pregnant
it absolutely devastated me
but i just closed my eyes and signed the papers
and is already available on many world wide web sites
we werent thinking about anything like that
it really was the first viral video
you can only sell so many fucking dvds
but when you open it up to the internet its endless
really the worlds gonna see this
to view the andersonlee sex tape
causing a cyber traffic jam on multiple websites
and i hate when people say that we settled
making fun what what are you talking about
im shocked
pamela lee pamela lee and tommy lee
pamela and tommy lee…
it was super humiliating
its not funny
its not funny this is devastating to us
well look…
it is it is
gotta get a clear picture
oh thats pathetic
know my favorite part
it was different for me than it was for him
tommy is a rock star
it all adds to the image of the craziness and everything
but i knew at that point my career was over
ive always loved fairy tales would you wanna be a serious actress
but had to kind of make a career out of the pieces left
then everything kind of blew up after that
yeah i dont feel very good
and i wanna articulate it the best i can because i… i mean its hard
sometimes you wonder why youre talking about it all again
but you know its part of what were doing and…
in my own words
i have romanticized the past
so i mean now that were talking about it
tommy comes by every day
tommy was so jealous
i thought it was cute
i had to kiss david chokachi but i didnt tell tommy
he came and trashed my trailer on the set
put his fist through a cabinet
i apologized for not telling him
lying as he put it
and told him it wouldnt happen again
he would see what scene she was in
they would change the dialogue change the scene
tommy was always there
i was working always working
and we had two beautiful kids so i was busy with them
hi dylan happy valentines day
and id never spoken that way to him before
brandon was shaking and screaming and holding my leg
so i called 911 i put the receiver off
lee was arrested at the couples malibu home
a broken fingernail and also bleeding to that hand
the rock musician was released on half a million dollars bail
i… i miss my family very much
i never hit pamela
uh… uh…
not cool either
why would you do that
i mean what was it about your anger that would make you lash out physically
weve been going through a lot of stuff sex tapes appearing postpartum
and two new babies
tommy comes third now instead of first
mötley crüe drummer tommy lee was taken away in handcuffs
im happy that he took responsibility for this
and i think its the first step towards healing
do you think he deserves six months
that dylan at six or seven weeks was in pamelas arms
fate could have left you with one son instead of two
has that ever crossed your mind
afterwards absolutely
i have
i apologized several times
i mean i have all the letters from him from jail
aw picture yourself here and he had em all like…
brandon dylan tommy pamela
yeah
im sure i cant read these
i mean i had to bifurcate the divorce cause he wouldnt sign the papers
ive never loved someone so deeply
and by deeply i mean i loved his soul
where are we
thats when we were living in wayne gretzkys house
oh no way
hi baby
terrible
i hate that
night night baby
dylan smile baby
october 11th 1998
my little dilly
i cant see dylan
so one day you can read this and maybe understand
how we came to be where we are
that i have this this is when we first moved into the house
say im dillydo
im like all cute and brandons like a little devil
after knowing each other for four days
love at first sight
mommys bra
isnt that pretty
mommy and daddy will eventually be able to be friends i hope
than ever live with that abuse again
you will always be in a safe place
im trying to sleep
now get out you
you dont talk to mommy that way
dylan you are lying right next to me as i write this in mommys big bed
i love you so much im crying
what
say goodbye to lake tahoe
theres only one ho in here
theres only one ho in here oh no
my mom taught me the most important lesson in life
when you are hurt you have two options
to close off become bitter
love is the greatest healer
i always gravitated towards animals
i just felt like i could trust animals more than people
people always have projects for me
and i sometimes get really caught up in being a caricature
i want more
i need more
but i thought if i can attach it to animal activism
so i joined forces with peta
this mcdonalds has had meatfree burgers on its menu for a while
well activism is sexy
hows your show doing vip you ever go over budget
yeah just not on my clothes or anything like that
speaking of that lets talk about…
i dont think anyone would wear something they knew so much cruelty went into
in london pamela used a book signing
to use fake fur on hats worn by the royal guards at buckingham palace
for each autograph pamela signed she asked fans to return the favor
but only if they gave 250000 to peta
we love you pam thank you for inviting me to do this
it was so raunchy it was so not my kind of humor
but i still got to talk about things that were important to me
so it was kind of a tradeoff
i wanted to take that and use it for good
because this was 95 of the market
any relationship with north korea
not yet
…a forwardthinking compassionate move
she wants to always use her voice for people
and animals that dont have a voice
hes offered such an amazing and generous offer…
and its definitely brought her into some controversial places
hello ms anderson how is he
id say the internets bad
and hed say no its good cause you keep on learning everything you can
lying to me is the most damaging thing people can do to people
for me its just nice to know that someones whole life
is about truth and discovering truth
he just believes in justice believes in honesty
believes in um exposing governments for what theyre really doing
we dont want this kind of attention anymore
no like lets just have some peace
hows the family very good the boys are great
theyve seen… have they seen pictures of you like in playboy and stuff
no oh
i wasnt thinking when i was in playboy
but i never got the chance
you know they always found out before i could really talk to them about it
when i was a kid
i would just flush with anger
whoa
i remember one day after school
dylan coming to me in tears saying mom why did you do that tape
we didnt make a sex tape
how did that tape get out it was stolen
people actually thought we put it out there for some ridiculous reason
cause that became kind of a trend afterward
for celebrities that were using a sex tape to become famous
so kind of left us in that category
and still to this day
you could give me hundreds of millions a billion dollars id never take it
come on brandon focus now
and she was like no
she 100 cared about her family being okay and me being okay
never cared about money
she wouldve made millions of dollars if she just signed a piece of paper
instead she sat back with nothing and watched her career like
fizzle into thin air
i never get anything from playboy yeah
no
youre a very famous person
yeah thats true
my friend david lachapelle says im the least calculated person
im not that person when it comes to money
shes never worried about if shes okay
shes always made sure everyone else is okay
tommy lee how is he great were like a family
but um he loves his kids and we love each other and
theres lots of complicated reasons right
it wasnt always easy
whoo
and never has any partner of mine liked tommy
it was always like a jealousy
let bob help you
i know how
we moved to detroit that point in our lives
ortonville by the way
how long were we there for not long
yeah we… we left pretty quick
purely superficial thats it
and i married kid rock
my faithful partner and my loving cowboy
bob and i and a pineapple
we just didnt have that height that frenzy i was used to
i didnt want anything less than that
the bottom line is you know i…
i… yes i… i touched the stove
salomon calls
rick salomon what are you doing
rick salomon
hes a professional poker player
and then we got married
and he ended up being a big drug addict
we found a crack pipe in the christmas tree
it wasnt me
so we were only married a few months
it was annulled but were still friends
we decided to try it again
it didnt last long either
she loves getting married you know
and giving them good examples in their life
uh tomorrow
its been a while it has
how long ago was it how many husbands ago was it
exactly
he goes baby youre a romantic keep on trying
and so i went and…
i met a professional athlete
he was very strong
and he was very jealous
if theres any abuse or emotional abuse you dont have to stay in it
doesnt matter if its your fifth marriage
doesnt matter what people think
im attracted to these very hetero masculine men
or this kind of sexual thing but im not the damsel in distress
i am very capable
and some men hate you for being something else
and sometimes they start grabbing you by the hair and throwing you into walls
and like stripping your clothes off
it just touched some kind of weird part of a man in my relationships anyway
i know your dads an asshole but i love him
rip the bandaid off and just get rid of these guys
cause i would pick people similar i guess in some ways
and maybe because of some of the relationships i had
i didnt equate being in love with being nice maybe
im hardwired to just be like the most like loving and insane person ever
i go my mom tells me to be fearless to be in love
theyre like what the fuck does that even mean
means you gotta be brave to be in love yeah
as i record this…
…before the madness starts
happy birthday lover
a thousand purple balloons
oh my god
happy birthday
i love you baby
to us
whoo
i can fear whats next
so crazy you know
its snowing
its snowing
but i dont even remember that
eros is more about passion and sex and crazy
agapes more commitment and supportive and that kind of love
hello
its so disappointing
why cant we live a romantic life every day
you look beautiful
give it to me i wanna do you no
let me do you please
what up gorgeous
what would that be awesome or what
its fucked
lets go for a walk
i love you i love you
i think what it all comes down to is that
and even though i thought i could
recreate a family or fall in love with somebody else
so i think thats probably why i keep failing in all my relationships
and my parents i think were wild and crazy
and madly in love and made stupid decisions
but they stuck it out and stayed together and i can see that theyre happy now
so i think id rather be alone
its impossible to be with anybody else
its almost like a punishment
here she is after another divorce
trying to move on with her life
trying to have some sort of normalcy
but then…
new hulu miniseries pam and tommy that so many people are talking about
true story of the former couples leaked sex tape
that you know fucked someone up
it really gives me nightmares
i have no desire to watch it not gonna watch it
nobody really knows what we were going through at that time
they shouldve had to have my permission
are you surprised its being told now
nah im stoked thats cool
as much as it did the first time
theres no use figuring out anything about it
the damage is done
why would i wanna go through that again
i know the storm is coming
i really dont know where im gonna go next i feel restless
how our wanting to love our yearning for love
i was taking a month just to kind of regroup after my divorce here
we who love obsessively are full of fear
fear of being alone
i thought you said you retired and wanna build houses on your property in canada
and i was like i think i need a little more than that
and literally just putting that out there into the universe
broadway called
its the real deal they sent me the script so it must be real
oh my god
this is just my shoes
mostly my shoes
um were not gonna get crazy were doing classic
these are new york
these are broadway
im gonna wear whatever the hell i want
and… and everyone can just suck it
im not a natural singer not a natural dancer
oh my gosh can i do this
when those moments happen run with it
oh my veil
my wedding veil
hmm one of them
which husband
theyre really expensive
you know its okay to start something new in your fifties
cant believe i even said that word
just focus
have a love affair with myself
wake me up when theres a veggie burger in front of me
its like jumping on the express train when you thought it was local
and youre like oh shit im missing my stop
no move in this show is without intention
oh my god pamela anderson yes
i probably somewhere in my lifetime have tried to be pamela anderson
i wanna do one more thing which is the mess around all right
oh well
shit you got that
ive been messing around a long time
i feel like its probably the first time im really doing something
yes
howd you watch the first three episodes three episodes were last night
they try to like give him reasons for stealing this shit
because dad was an asshole and didnt pay him
did dylan watch it
oh god i just…
im like shaking
that people think oh poor pamela or its poor you dylan
okay well thanks for keeping me updated but just…
i love you baby yeah i love you
oh god
yeah i didnt know that
this is called an emotional eat
it was a survival mechanism
and now that its all coming up again i feel sick
like you belong to the world
just ignore them
you know roxies favorite word
i dont think so
some good stuff pamela
hows it feeling
welcome
are you sure no
my sweet
first freaking note
we both reached for the gun
but i got it first
its so good i know its exactly setting my hips up
okay that burns
who are you people
if this is a dream ill be pissed
this is me on broadway
kind of before and after a lot of the abuse in my life
im really visualizing that that were doing this together
thats a coldblooded murder mrs hart theyre liable to hang you for that one
ive always gone to a certain point and went thats good enough
cause its the only choice
if i care what people think i wouldnt be here right now
were pushing through this which is not a bad thing
its… its… its causing you to fight for it
okay
its out of my hands
at the risk of complete humiliation
dont worry brandon
you know what this is the thing its gonna be an earthquake
a volcano
we just dont know whats coming out of the volcano
i feel its unfair
where we hear something about an actor doing a certain project
and we want to go what gives them the right to do that
theyre not this theyre not that
thats what shes had to fight through
why not
no roxie
shes not scared of anything
its crazy shes pretty badass
now more than ever shes finally focused
and not worried about pleasing anyone else
not worried about what her boyfriends gonna think
if her husbands gonna get jealous
i wanna embrace the past
im not a victim
like poetry music art
im grateful for all the experiences i had
im glad it happened
it does feel like uh ive just been through a hurricane
feels kind of good
im sure im not finished
but i have no idea what im gonna do next
my kids are grown
um…
im basically alone
i should be settled in somewhere but…
maybe ill know next week

another one of us has been located
we must remove her from danger
from those who have created an imbalance of life
has been threatened by those
this crisis has a name
divinity

but soon it will be time to rebuild
creepy ass places

50
100 200
may i suggest the double decade
i long for your eternal happiness sir
i long for your eternal happiness
we shouldnt keep your brother waiting
especially today of all days sir
get the present ready
jaxxon
give me some
come here
day 3109
that has remained unaffected by the environment
preserving that result is paramount
in retaining pure longevity
is a completely different story
so that brain function can keep up
with the bodys rejuvenation
they both must interconnect with each other
to finish the process
the good news is i believe i have found the solution
youre enjoying this arent you
i can still probably reverse these effects
theres still time to recover
you know who i am
im jaxxon pierce
 jaxxon pierce  yes
jaxxon pierce
but this world has been morally corrupted by divinity
guys guys theres some people outside
what day
what
what time is it
you were lucky enough to have gotten this far
and it has for you
let me go
help guys
help me
shit
ill take care of this
lets hide him
what should we do
wheres the answer
slow it down
like this
thats right
youre different than your brother
i sense no trace of the chemical in your body
im still pure
able to still give birth
love
and pleasure
are you safe
im still
im still
son
son son
son
father is that you
son what have you done
look at what theyre doing to me
this was not my vision jaxxon
and used it in the worst possible way
thats not true no
my poor child
i loved you and your brother so much
im still here
youre different
still here people on this planet
im still here
youre safe
jaxxon rip
come on
i told you
daddy
hey jaxxon
no
you failed me son
no
you left us
jaxxon
such a disgusting creature
the world was in pain and misery
i lifted them up
i gave them meaning to live
you have to remove your persona and let go
goddamn it you keep saying that
of what
 your pain  my pain
daddy
kill me now you fuck
jaxxon
in here
wait here
untie me
who did this to you
these fucking brothers
why
dont ask me why i have no idea
look at me
be strong rip
must never let them escape
do you understand me they dont escape
theyll pay for this
uh no
kill her
get em go get them
theres no more fucking time
yes brother for our father
fuck our father
no
take that you pig
let go
oh my god
brother
its okay
hold on here
no
no
so i had to put all my efforts into action
yes it may not be his vision
but now its my vision
my vision
it was up to me to bring this product to this next level
the answer did lie in the fetal tissue
the ultimate sacrifice has been made by those too young
because through my research i found that the solution
can only be made from early embryonic stages
could be created from just one fetus
so the eggs had to be fertilized developed into fetuses
through a delicate and controlled environment
for the correct extraction to be made
but these needed to be living beings
with a fetal tissue was not easy
we now have to ask the question
choices my father was afraid to make
of this new divinity not when it saves their lives
true immortality of both body and mind
i feel
so
its okay
its okay
its okay youre strong
you have to push push
push
not much longer
oh its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming
its coming its coming

mark
an8to you and me from mark
right now were at korat mom
we stopped at a gas station
we already knew that
you and dad are splitting
will you let us choose who we want to live with
pick up here
here
pad
me
huh
if we live with mom
itd probably be like this school break
bangkok nakhon phanom
that dads disappeared
do you think…
well become distant with dad one day
but if we live with dad
wed live in the same house
study at the same school
and only get to see mom during the school break
when we grow older
do you think
if we chose one
and they simply say im fine
because we arent living in their world anymore
then what should we do
because theyre worried about y2k problems
because it is safer
moreover…
you me
if youre done bring me the tape
okay
as for petrol stations its reported that
ill go lots of cars
in the chance upon entering 2000
and a disaster may happen

i dont feel like its my place really
its not your place
uhuh you dont mess with people like that
okay yeah ill ask her at the party tomorrow
good
thanks
asshole
a rocker pool party and i wasnt invited
hell yes
but conrad was on a mission
and i suppose thats more important than free booze
and potentially seeing scantily clad women
you gotta show what you got
some kind of vampire rocker
hey dork
want some tequila
dude youre so weird its alcohol
hi im anya nice to meet you
anya is my girlfriend
let me guess youre a basketball player
so is this really her house
shes been hurt before
when shes depressed or manic she cycles more
i met her as sarah

an aussie huh
pretty sexy
shes literally my favorite girlfriend ever
i mean it yeah well remember
my girls a basketball player
and im a ninja
are you okay

youre wasting your breath mate
im a lesbian
uh let me start with im conrad
so hi im sarah
so wonder if i could ask your advice about a girl
all right
well great
far out you millennials here take a sip
thats actually not bad for an oldder persons drink
okay so this chick
this girl woman
shes like a roller coaster and i dont know why
i feel like theres so much about her i dont know
id like to
im usually the guy that walks out the door
when i was in my 30s which was decades ago
i thought i was in love once too
if youre wondering how shes feeling
so stop being a piss pot and get it together
i get that but what if she still gets defensive
and wont talk to me
im not abandoning her
also shes actually really hot
so maybe we could do a threesome sometime
you never know for the right lady
now he said she switched at the party
to avoid a discussion
i reminded him again about the blowtorch
were almost done here sugar
hope you brought your appetite
jazz
just a moment
had this forever
lets find out
youre good
you said youre from oklahoma but then
um no but listen i really wanted to
talk to you about this so
lets be impulsive now
did i forget something
hey
hey im sorry to bother you so late
but i just
i miss you too molly
yes ive got some time before work
molly molly
the door was unlocked so i let myself in
are you okay is everything okay
with work home
i havent really asked you much about home
theres nothing really to talk about
i just wanted you here
i needed to feel safe
even if its uh
you want me to wear your underwear
would you
just dont asked me to wear lipstick
hey whats with the number seven
you have a lot of them
im obsessed with the number toot
yeah of course
so he arranged to meet them at their favorite spot
coffee bombing huh

can i get you something
sit down
molly i need to talk to you about something
no
oh my god no no no but i havent been fair to you

how you look at it
its complicated
the others
how the hell would i know about your other women
no about your others
oh you think im cheating on you
who
and how they come out at various random times
but thankfully they all seem to like me
what
say another word to her about the other parts
im sorry who are you
molly doesnt know about vanessa silk and sarah
neither do they about her
and what are you
i keep her safe i keep them all safe
not to share
you care about these girls
keep your mouth shut
bring this up again and were gone
do we understand each other
you always know where she is
taking advantage of my generosity
what
the mushroom powder
and i wanted to try it again but i spilled it
with another girl
at least as far as i know
five
yes but the thing is theyre all the same girl
and none of them know about each other
actually she didnt threaten that
it was horrifying
take off your apron and get outside
now
take it off

to be a chef
you know youre a lot easier to talk to than frank
i think he hates me
he always has been
and she wants to sleep with literally everyone but him
including you
yeah
he works in people with head problems
i think you and your girl you should talk with him
i dont think shed be receptive
tell her its about something else
paul does hypnotherapy for parties and stuff all the time
it feels slightly dishonest but okay
okay

thanks for coming over is it doctor or paul
paul paul is fine
okay
yeah yeah she has a shopping addiction thing so
oh just right here
i think youll love it
molly hi this is paul

for you know your shopping addiction
i know you like to be spontaneous
and try new things and stuff

i think it could be fun
im in just dont make it worse
all right here comes the fun part
okay
just close your eyes

just being okay with that and other times
its a matter of wanting to fuse the personalities
all of the personalities and their memories into one

the fact that she introduced herself by name
as the alternates
means that she trusts you and she cares about you
in an odd sense yes
i want to help her

maybe when shes on the straight and narrow
she can come play with us
i only have two controllers i need to get another one

at the restaurant be grateful
staying in lousy hotels no sleep bad for relationships
so many of us are never that
its my first day as assistant chef
okay
will never turn down free food lets go
got it
but conrad assured me shed been doing great
however nothing could have prepared me for that dinner
congratulations on your first time cooking with regina
i hope we all survive
will this is molly
i thought i was meeting silk
well silk was here but then she
whos this bitch
who the hell are you hi im will
silk pleasure to meet you jerkoff
i hear you are in a band killer singer
yep im a songwriter too
so maybe you could join the band
hey mate
is this still silk
no thats sarah lesbian
thats weird
you have a problem with gay women
sure babe
lets go sexy
i think im missing a joke in there somewhere
but all right
shes busy
doing what exactly
maybe you should mind your own business
goddamn pencil dick
oh whats happening now
rita we dont mean silk any harm
we just wanted to
wanted what
andale shaka topaca beyonce and baraka
see you gotta be forceful with these negative entities conrad
you thought what jackass
hey a little help
okay you did just try to exorcise my girlfriend
so im on her side
 nice meeting you conrad  wow
you had every right to defend yourself
he had it coming besides hes a buddhist
you really do care dont you
i do i care about you as whoever you are
silk vanessa molly sarah
but only because shes kind of rude and bossy and controlling
but hey im sure shes a lovely person
most systems give themselves a name
where am i
in a restaurant
hi my names conrad
i know theyre all me but i havent been out in decades
i remember when i was seven but everything else feels like
i was watching life from behind a glass wall
now i get your obsession with the number seven
silk was next yeah or so they told me
i trust you right
yeah you do
can you tell me more about them
you want to be impulsive
silk is an amazing singer and her band members love her
tell me more
she is snarky she is fun and she hates driving
although ironically she loves grand theft auto
hates driving
how the heck can you live in la and hate driving
well vanessa loves barbecue and is an amazing chef
but no judgment she has great legs
and no way interested in me she is a kind and generous soul
and she really helped with being able to talk to
well all of you then thank you sarah
yeah
me too
look
i felt like he left because of me
with my grandparents when they went away
is that when silk showed up
i think they were always there
but i guess i wanted to keep the scary parts away
and that caused them to fracture
they had walls between them
a pizza analogy
im sorry im so much trouble
i had to look at my own
started when my dad left
id line up my albums and categorize them
by genre and year and color and label
i had a spreadsheet of every battery in the house
where it was and its charge level
id brush my teeth five times a day
with five different toothbrushes
its weird i know
at least you remember doing it
i noticed
yeah no im meeting with paul and maxine right now
cool
i got you a present
you ready
no i mean home to michigan
they never knew
im sorry conrad youve been amazing
i have a whole life ahead of me now
understanding them
and you have me
a little lost and found tag and everything
youve helped me a lot and for that im grateful
but
what shes trying to tell you conrad
is that she needs her own time
two against one huh
its not that she doesnt care about you
and i want whats best for you to be happy
what
she said yes
but you were taken
youre not gonna have time for women
no applause please no applause
ill be here all night
i miss her man i really do
that stuff was so good that you showed me
and molly and vanessa and sarah
 rita  no screw her
hell no

oh okay ill be right back
im melinda and the generous gentleman is
im conrad im the chef
so what do you cook conrad

this doesnt feel right
somethings wrong

i repeat we have friendlies down in the hot zone
come on

put it away put it away
air force baby thats how we do it
 lets go  yes sir
 congratulations man  oh man got it
 congratulations  hey thank you
 good job  thanks

that last one kinda hurt
looks like it
so try not to hurt yourself all right
especially with these guys over here
ill be ready
you couldnt move the flight stick
yada yada yada yada
oh my gosh no no no no
 that was  no come on
you cant do it not this time
that was different man
you were one of them
okay just be ready

lets just say i got a hunch
all right
just be ready for anything
well im gonna need a team
i mean these guys at afla theyre good
but i dont think they can handle any of that
listen well be fine come on man
its the red white and blue baby
now go get em
angle to your departure
frequency is 26307
target is six miles and coming fast
here we go baby bear
hey edge what do we got on the mission playlist today
how about something a little more subtle
like christian like this time around
oh i got just the track
take it to buster girls
multiple amounts of missile tests
at 0600 hours this morning
they managed to land one sixty miles
outside the russia shoreline
as we speak the navy is sending out
a second aircraft carrier to the border of south kiyung
the losses will be catastrophic
wed be sending off fighters to their death
one of the joint chiefsofstaff recommendations
eliminating kim wun would buy us some time
but it does not stop the missile production
kill his cousins his uncles his nephew
his girlfriend soninlaw
i think eliminating one mans family tree
is certainly more beneficial to us than someone
and i think the national security council
would agree
good morning colonel
colonel grace daley national security
so that makes 24 shows this year
thats affirmative
its actually not that bad
listen we have to
russian migs
lets get inside
just earlier today
we had some unexpected visitors
over the atlantic ocean when two migs
flew just twenty feet off the deck
of one of our navy aircraft carriers
a spokesperson from the navy tells us that they immediately
the migs claimed to be on a training exercise
and stated they were simply saying hello to the carrier
well be right back
yeah okay next time were up there
let me buzz one of their ships
and see how well thats saying hello stories
 yeah baby  yeah woo
man they gotta change my call sign to hollywood man
im making the news
 hell yeah  hey sweetheart
funny i didnt see your face on the report

the united states has placed sanctions
on north kiyung and some of its financial firms
in giannia in an effort to tighten the rope
north kiyung released a public statement today
they have been threatening us since way before our time
theyre not gonna do anything
yeah i dont know what it is
but that guy just does not like us
dont mention it
one of them being olson walter only 22 years old
the condition of the americans is currently unknown
those poor guys didnt do anything
theyre just using em as leverage
did you guys know that their whole country
believes america is just military
yeah i read that somewhere
they have like pictures of american military men
yup
they think the whole reason we exist is just to attack them
whatever it is im an american
speaking of flying edge tomorrow

for every woman on the planet by shutting jeeters mouth
look i respect your christianity
and your devotion to christ
youre supposed to love forgive and all of that
and a member of this team is to protect us

i dont know who the hell authorized
that ridiculous circus act
i understand admiral im looking into it now
 within the hour  within the hour sir
good day admiral
well i dont think i need to explain much
as im sure you overheard
youre losing control of your squadron lieutenant
no maam
and ive already spoken with lieutenant lee
about the situation to assure it doesnt happen again
or a contest of colorful actions
unfortunately it happened
as the team leader i must assume responsibility
for my wing girls actions maam
the flight recorder is going to reflect
that lieutenant riebach gave me a direct order
numerous times and i disobeyed commander
policy
youre really gonna stand here and try to educate me
no no no maam
that was not what i was trying to say wrong choice of words
youre damn right bad choice of words
all of you get in here
from pilot duty and suspended until further notice

dick
now in the korean war
we lost 2837 aircrafts
and that was in 1950
but so has our missile stockpile
as you saw on my test today
we were unsuccessful when evading the sams
north kiyung knows this and i can assure you
this is where were gonna need pilots
now we dont have time to train for this
we need to do this in three stages
to put it bluntly north kiyung
ah a lot i could say about that
getting worse by the minute
washington needs to figure out something quickly
i dont know if youre aware but we are
and eliminating the constant threat of nuclear attacks
and one of your squadrons became a unit of interest
weve already sent two aircraft carriers over
and multiple squadrons to the southern border
i lost my husband there
i can tell you that we are looking
for your best pilots
with advanced aerial capabilities
a squadron that can maneuver through such conditions
on advanced maneuvering with our pilots daily
i wish i could help you but unfortunately i dont have
sure you do
absolutely not
with all due respect commander
youre asking me to volunteer six women who are aerial
stunt performers not combat aviators
shes a devoted christian and she wont participate
in combat hence why she flies for the aerial demo team
flying a 40 million aircraft just for fun
our government trained them for combat
im quite sure if they refuse the order
they will be restricted from flying
and then perhaps we could offer them a job at the mall
handing out navy brochures
yeah that ones not gonna work
theyre already suspended
by our government
well commander i will have an order on your desk
by days end tomorrow to unsuspend them
and i can assure you i will have the total support
from the department of defense
and our national security council
to proceed with this operation
you will be hearing from us very soon
good day commander
dude what the hell
dude what did they teach you
in basic training come on
whens the last time you shot a gun
try it again

air force last resort operation center
thats correct lieutenant
to ask for additional details commander
i dont have the details ladies
what i can tell you is that the us navy
and running some training exercises with you
leave your grudges at the door
i dont wanna send them delirious
lazyeyed pilots in the morning
good night ladies

aflr is boarding our ship
we arent going anywhere
and thats not true bear

we can always say no cant we
i have to tell you im quite excited that you all are here

they have 17000 pilots in the service
yup
and only 700 women
six of them are right here
would you guys listen to yourselves
youre pilots for the united states navy

breaking news out of washington
its coming in right now
olson walter the 22yearold student
that was previously imprisoned in north kiyung
has died at his home this evening
north kiyung leader kin huan has released a statement
he promised every american citizen
will scream in terror
now that he has an icbm
capable of reaching los angeles
and possibly even washington and new york

im coming with you
ehrengard the art of seduction
please sit still your grace
if so it was not conscious
remain still
is something wrong
i got the impression that the grand duke wanted me to… imprison your beauty
in that case one cant be petty
so
you are stopping
this is taking an eternity
yes
a true portrait takes time yes i have observed
like a seduction
mr cazotte
miss zimmermann
mr cazotte
rent is overdue if you dont pay… my dear madam my dear madam…
and its on its way trust me its coming
smile its a lovely day all is good
thank you for having me
i am delighted most delighted
thank you
the painter
the painter
and then nothing like her
interesting you said and then nothing like her
i believe that art should be more than just lifelike
my daughter
your daughter yes
you look so troubled not enjoying it here
very much your grace
please tell me who you are gazing at
hearing about the passions of living beings and all the details
a young madam
where there
ehrengard she is lovely
a rather forbidding family so i gathered yes
did she like the portrait was she spellbound by your ability
i wouldnt say that precisely
a new portrait
we need your help
my husband isnt a direct descendant
count marbod
yes its so sad
my son stands to inherit the throne
but he isnt married so he cant inherit it
maybe under different circumstances but…
and how am i to help your grace
observe my son
grand duchess look at the young prince and the ladies around him they flock
but he barely looks at them not so much as a smile
prince lothar must find a wife soon
or else the throne will be given to…
grand duchess …my husbands cousin
stammering just to… yes grand duchess mr cazotte your task…
your craft must be to awaken my sons rapture
his in french belle passion
but i must insist you are rewarded for your efforts
very well
ill try my best
naturally your grace
keep the rest
my name is cazotte i am an artist
i mean you no harm my lord
forgive me but you looked a little sad standing over there
they want me to marry cazotte who
my mother and father
everyone no
cazotte no
with all due respect of course… have misunderstood something
is actually liberating freedom
allow me to show you some sketches my lord
cazotte from my love life
cazotte you like that one its yours keep it
what i told him during those days and nights
cazotte i recited passages from both decameron and the canterbury tales
about silky rose petals swelling hearts intoxicated with blood
an outing to the castle in leuchenstein
im painting a family portrait there id like to bring the prince
introduce him to the daughters not without your permission of course
apart from the youngest
ludmilla but shes still a child
not any longer your grace she turns 18 next week
so
and you know the family well
i painted their portraits a long time ago yes
only their portraits
your grace what do you think of me
and dress like some peasant
no as my pupil but yes anonymity
you can weigh up ludmilla without the burden of your title
she is like the rose whose rich fragrance innocently
lures the passerby to pluck the bloom
but no one has picked it so far
the knees
the ankles
cazotte we must however make one minor adjustment
cazotte princess ludmilla you have bloomed with such swiftness
mama papa may i
now lets see
im blushing cazotte dont
cazotte and pardon me…
isnt he handsome
cazotte handsome and with a gifted soul he finds beauty where no one else does
thats talent
in fact it was his idea to refine your portrait
cazotte youre not doing her justice
she hides even greater beauty he said that
he didnt say that he did
and i had to agree
no yes
hes of noble extraction
like yourself
mine cazotte no no well
no cazotte two frisky puppies
ludmilla come
they walked the castle garden
lothar come
you are a genius mr cazotte
you have done our lineage a great service
cazotte please know that yes
yes
grand duchess count yourself lucky i didnt mention your name he was incensed
but the wedding ceremony yes
my sons wedding you must accept the invitation i insist
priest accept these blessed and consecrated rings
which you have together made here today
i claim you to be my lawfully wedded wife
i claim you to be my lawfully wedded husband
priest amen
priest all who are gathered here today
priest amen
soldier and… halt
mr cazotte pack your belongings and come with us
you seem upset
cazotte yes yes
pardon im trying to say
that not one of your faithful subjects would fail to smile in their hearts
upon hearing of the matter that vexes you for everyone loves a loving couple
i already told you how difficult its been to keep babenhausen in our hands
oh because of cousin… marbod
living in sin may pass muster in your creative circles
but in ours its a death sentence
prince lothar will be disinherited
grand duchess in hiding cazotte yes that should be possible
in the dark
cazotte his eyes nothing else
i think i have found a plan to solve this
court marshal …in september
youll also see to the decor yes
oh oh less sure already
no your grace it just dawned on me
that princess ludmilla will need a special ladyinwaiting
someone we can trust grand duchess of course
that it would justify her selection
agreed yes of course
the princess in her isolation will need an associate of a similar
age and temperament as herself
youre doing it again you talk and talk…
ehrengard my goodness yes
you mean to seduce her
no
you are right
who understands the artist
excuse me but may i tell you what im thinking
yes
i see her
cazotte i see her
cazotte and this is precisely why like michelangelo i exclaim
within that block of marble is my greatest triumph buried
michelangelo block of marble warrior in a white frock aside
practically puritans all military people
you wont get near her
you have been too ambitious this time maybe so
yet i do not fret
then a wager may be put into play
a wager of
ehrengard wont surrender to you
and if she does
grand duchess if you win ehrengard i offer you lifelong employment at court
if she doesnt
very well
not even the grand duke
schreckenstein but please tell me
mr cazotte
…young valkyrie
brought up under the strictest military virtues
…flaming sword to stand guard over the young lovers paradise
i get beside myself i find ehrengards strength impressive
grins stop this stupidity
schreckenstein ehrengard pack your things
of course father
just one thing schreckenstein yes
may i bid kurt farewell
kurt
my fiancé your grace
yes for certain you may bid your fiancé farewell
you are a good girl wouldnt you agree mr cazotte
yes absolutely yes
yes sleep very well ehrengard
what a pompous charlatan
i have found a secluded place yes
rosenbad
rosenbad yes
its been unoccupied for generations precisely
servant welcome
hell remain here to keep a constant check on the princess health
grand duchess our riding master mr podolski
grand duchess and our excellent chief ladyinwaiting countess poggendorf
and ehrengard
ehrengard you know
cazotte onto the entrance hall do keep these doors shut to prevent a draft
poggendorf mr cazotte yes
may i ask you something naturally
mr cazotte yes
yes at the grand ball
you were standing by your portrait of the grand duchess
offend me
and we smile
i tried to create a place
are these for me yes they are
thank you pleasure
lothar cazotte
cazotte our little court has quickly settled into the romantic atmosphere
thats what a soldier must do
i have taught him fencing everyone in our family masters it
ehrengard yes many times
ehrengard you are up early
yes well i usually am
are you going riding
ehrengard if you want to ride alone… no
no no its fine uhm… i think i…
i think i can
good morning mr podolski good morning mr cazotte
same horse

ehrengard alpenglow yes alpenglow
its already vanishing
cazotte yes naturally
cazotte a clear day will follow its a miracle
your own horse
yes indeed and yours isnt
his name is wohtan
only i can ride him
i can imagine
mr cazotte
someones coming so turn them away
were visiting the princess im the grand dukes cousin
you will have to come back another day
the princess condition as you can imagine prevents her from seeing anyone
are you refusing me entry
im only a messenger i insist
cazotte listen… who do you think i am
cazotte im just… move
marbod
what a surprise
its but a short visit
but… lothar goodbye
marbod lothar dearest lothar its just a very short visit
did you see his lies obviously
we must remain close by
do you know anyone employed at the fine castle
perhaps you could reconsider your stance a little more carefully
cazotte i know that given the nature of the situation you cannot visit us
cazotte let me begin by telling you some happy news
cazotte and it immediately hit me
cazotte but it was something else
and i beg your grace not to see this as explicit or think of me as a voyeur
the entire magical atmosphere
simply cried out to be immortalized in art
nymph bathing in a forest lake
cazotte or dianas bath would in itself be a wonder
a glory the crowning moment of my career as an artist
fastening and fixing upon my canvas every line and hue of her young body
cazotte so i wait
cazotte instead i approach her in other ways
ehrengard wohtan hi
hi
…for my heart
ehrengard hi
kurt i missed you… but we cant meet this way
but why
perhaps someday i can tell you everything
farewell my friend
ludmilla yes
ehrengard the waters have broken
not quite yet
mr podolski send for the grand duchess
first the castle trembled with fear
mr cazotte be honest
is he healthy
come
lothar come
grand duchess congratulations
even i your grace someone not prone to sentimentality
and ehrengard how is it going with her
she has for the first time unbeknownst to herself
completely fallen in love
already cazotte mm

no no no on the contrary it serves my purpose perfectly
i sense you are grasping at straws
lothar mama
your coach awaits yes

lisbeth go
lisbeth can…

taverner brandy go on
then lets hope it is good
the court has employed someone new keep going
a woman
and what else a woman with small children

its all one big lie
then…
my good man

i have a job for you
possession of marbod yes
and as thanks for your heroic achievements
once my wife and i take over the throne
good
ehrengard mr cazotte
cazotte yes
yes last night was the shortest night
and on this shortest night im in the fresh air
ehrengard ritual yes
in its most tremulous moment
tremulous where it is most fecund
ehrengard it sounds rather sad
nettles with their burning embrace the forest lake with its gentle caresses
im just thinking out loud let me see it
cazotte no im just thinking out loud yes
podolski mr cazotte
mr cazotte
pardon me
i made sure they wont enter rosenbad and hear the child
well have a picnic when
this sunday theres no way out no
we must hide the child
and ludmilla should be… six months pregnant sizeable
lisbeth must stay here with the child
and everyone else must be carefully instructed
cazotte yes
cazotte well as you know i have painted her every morning
why doesnt that silly fool just
seduce the girl the oldfashioned way and set his mind at rest
…an artist
i could seduce the girl the oldfashioned way and itd be less difficult
i could seduce her at a given moment where her soul is agitated impulsive
by no means i still intend to seduce her your grace
and that is genuine seduction
she will become the rose its petals are shed
once the passion has conquered the soul the body follows after
when she sees the painting she will simply be astonished… and succumb
she will succumb our ehrengard
should i ready your horse miss ehrengard
now ive… made a terrible mistake
he promised me i would get my lisbeth back if i helped him
ive made a terrible mistake
now i have to help
tomorrow…
listen
proceed as agreed
understand me
what ehrengard proceed as agreed
and keep lisbeth unaware
it will work out if you listen to me
here i am
you look pale are you feeling crestfallen
we still need chairs
ehrengard cazotte
ehrengard
the lake

it was so funny
so i bought some chocolate and candies for you
that memory makes you laugh it gives me the creeps

your hand is almost at the knife you look down
an explosion of violence gimme that money

i feel the same passion for fighting im passionate
 but that passion for fighting is gone  yeah i create now
ive had my share of fights
violence was all i had it was my tool
total chaos and then the past
i used to explode
youre fighting but
youre losing
police say the victim was stabbed
 three months  nah it was longer
it could have easily gone wrong
my life after that moment would not have applied
thats why i cherish the opportunity ive had
i want others to have the same opportunity show them look

then again life doesnt have to be easy
thats what gives it its sauce and scent and flavour
it adds excitement

you become the chef making the food instead of being eaten
your roles change too you become
a master of suffering life itself
you understand
were you filming me the whole time

tachibana won all four matches by ko

with the beat of our rap ginga
but yara youre a rapper not rambo

hes my husband
they said he went missing in action
did anyone see him
whats his war name
and who told you he was here
he did
you should ask the shooter
hes had more war than all of us put together
spit it out whats your problem
did you ever fight with a comrade
ive fought with comrades with eyes of every colour
they said he went missing in action
does this photo help
if i remember anyone like that ill tell you
if you wanted to find someone in this war
and no one ever leaves
youd better untie it before it chokes you
han yo i dont conform to living in a country
where the ones who should protect us become the agressors
han and what about my rights
my songs dont reach far they dont play them on the radio or television
new country
mulemba mulemba
i find myself
in the comfort of your shade
and in the firmness of your roots
here time doesnt exist
and we are happy
the soul is still in shade
the presence that sustains the earth
thats pretty
who taught it you
i learnt it from my mother
she sang it a lot before my father died
when the wars over youll be a singer
no
writing what
my stories my dreams
those with beautiful dreams fight better
weapons also kill dreams
in the area of soyo
in the oil fields
our unit was surrounded
after heavy fighting all through the night
and there were some wounded
the sun was coming up
there was a fighter called venga
he put down his weapon
took off his uniform and smiled
he looked like a crazy man
he set off running into the jungle
the enemy went after him and we managed to escape
in my mind
in my head
i can still see that look
this venga is it my ekumbi
nayola
if you want to find your husband
search with your heart
but how
that story when did it happen
stay back
shooter
take the bazooka
go on
go on nayola
point it at the front of the plane
shoot
shoot
what a fury girl
what time do you call this
ticktock ticktock ticktock
you have to pick the hours out
and pick them before they suck the life out of you
thats why i like this clock so much
what happened to your tshirt
god help us
gods had other things on his mind lately
and ill lock you in the house until you learn some sense
that was a kalashnikov
 theyre rockets mama  its carnival
but what are they celebrating
theyre celebrating life
life with gunshots
the conditions of our people
i was on his side
against my mother
you dont clip the wings of a falcon
you give it raw meat to make it strong
raw meat didnt work for either of them
else theyd be here with me now
see you tomorrow mama

mama
the war ended 8 years and 12 days ago
you know sometimes i dream a lot
i also dream a lot about your mother
its not my mother i dream about
that jackal has been circling us since sundown
my husbands war name is venga
venga disappeared in soyo
people dont disappear like that
they are alive or dead but they are always somewhere
here people disappear very slowly
nephew
uncle
what are you doing here
im fighting for the people
we are children of angola
you should be studying
no uncle
youre on the wrong side uncle
what i know about the wrong side
is that its the side my father fought for
and died for this country
your father was my brother
and died on the wrong side
wrong side for those who fought for independence
this is also my fight
again the wrong side conversation
youre coming home with me right now
just stay calm
lets talk

lets stop the music for a bit well continue later
but now a moment for our lotte
who will honour us with a song
madame if you please

i lost my soninlaw
and right after that
my
my daughter

to show who we really are
me for example
id wear a medusa mask
careful with the glass
 what happened to her mother  she abandoned me
no she didnt
she disappeared during the war
she might still come back
please just go

wed like that
he fell face down in the mud
sunk and disappeared
it was raining
i heard more shots
then soldiers went by
then a tree began to grow
a mulemba
a very very tall mulemba
you know its good youre here listening
its almost like we were a family
hey girl
you cant stay there
its dangerous
do you work here uncle
i do
my father worked here
my grandfather worked here
where does this go
the wind is changing
peace is coming for the others
those who havent been bitten by the war
peace
peace peace peace
and no one ever leaves

what a beautiful death
a death full of life
be careful
the wars over
peace peace peace peace

ooh yeah
lets go hurry up
oh my god
the cleveland browns host the miami dolphins
thats my dad bobby coleman
not how anyone expected his career to start
might have been his first fumble
but it wasnt his last
i turned six in indianapolis
eight was in chicago
bobby coleman coughs up the ball
then we were on to jacksonville for my tenth
but you can probably guess what happened
and then the football comes loose
the big 13 was in minneapolis
i wasnt there long enough to make friends
twelve years after that first fumble
we ended up in atlanta
keisha why are you watching that
come on dont listen to em
listen to me
because weve already moved so many times
look i dont like picking up
and shuffling to a new city either
i know one thing
if anderson fisher wasnt on the team
id definitely make the roster
and maybe start thinking about what life might look like
come on baby
but i cant take another trade
so that better be look at this house
 okay  okay
and back to the lions
whoa
girl thats my move
i saw you in the reflection
 you did  mmhmm
you really gotta step up your game
if you wanna make the roster
you gotta be at peak physical condition
uhuh no buts
look weve been down this road before
first its cinnamon rolls
then i find you hoarding oreos under the bathroom sink
its not very hygienic
everybody got their vices
im just saying
am i wrong
no thats why i have a high obr in madden
go outside
and make a few friends you know
i know it hasnt been easy all this moving around
you mean its not every girls dream
 a fair hit  mmhmm
but i feel different about atlanta baby girl
yeah ive heard that one before
but it would be nice
to finally call a city home for once
 guess what  hmm
i couldnt agree more
i dont wanna keep being the reason we move
good
 oh can i show you something  of course
okay so ive been working on some predictive analytics
to help prepare you for your first game
 okay  i catalogued
all the falcons styles from the past season
and coded an algorithm in python that can predict
what
 yes daughter im listening  okay so
time for school
 ha ha ha get it get it 
 i got the bag im runnin with it 
 this ones rippin hit the curb like its ready

 any time you see me step on the stage 
and tony here we go
 caught up in your feelins like you froze 
 everything around you gettin 
well on the opening drive jim
look for the falcons to establish the run early today
especially with anderson fisher
who had a sensational rookie season last year
anderson fisher the young star
looking to duplicate his success from last year
and taylor will start out in the gun here
and quickly some pressure off the edge
and down he goes
taylor oh my gosh
fisher thats your assignment
mistakes are gonna happen
twenty hut
and they give it to fisher
what a tough start for anderson fisher
i agree with coach evans here
to miss pass protection on the first play
here we go with the veteran bobby coleman
a bold move no doubt ton
a surprising move
so from the young buck to the veteran coleman here
third down for the falcons
bobbys gotta move over jim
yeah there ya go bobby
ready in motion motion
hes looking
he has nobody down field open
coleman with a nice little sidestep
bobby coleman is making some moves
ah oh excuse me
college he was the guy
hes got great in stincts
runs into the wall
no way
he was so amped up
i was right
i cant believe it worked
bobby coleman his glory days being reclaimed
for a moment here
yeah
hes been the story so far today tony
what is happening here
another sidestep and there he goes
one more time folks
bobby coleman fourth touchdown of the day
even blowing a kiss to his wife keisha in the crowd
bobby coleman one more time
but bobby and the falcons are playing better
its off the charts
this time coleman splits out wide
they throw it to him
hes got three panthers ahead of him
whats he doing
hes going backwards
what a move
he went backwards to go forwards
and with touchdown number six
he scored six touchdowns
you were right but this wasnt part of the plan
look at this
but after all that hes done in this game
its inspirational jim
i mean truly this guy was on
the practice squad three days ago
whoo
hey hey hey hey
yeah yeah
thats how we play thats how we play
listen up listen up
execution determination everything we talk about
let me see that game ball
speaking of that today
a certain someone showed he still got some wheels
and and and and
some questionable dance moves
thank you
bobby bobby bobby
those six touchdowns gave me life
 six  six
i still cant believe it
oh well you gotta believe it baby

but maybe if anyone actually knew
what they were doing on this team
this wouldnt be a problem
there is no better story in the nfc
he aint all that
with a recordtying six touchdown game
yeah i did it first

especially when you see him with his daughter
those two make quite the couple
oh its adorable
playing a whole lot of madden

the way bobbys been playing
it seems hes leveled up in real life

thats the reason dads been playing so well
callie amber coleman is that what you think
its true its true keish

but the game has some sort of power over me
but well come back to that
is that whatever callie does in a video game
bobby mirrors on the field move for move
how could you two keep something like this a secret
but dad said not to
wait wait wait youre sorry about that
how bout the fact that you just made all of my skills disappear
gone poof just like that

bobby

and anderson fishers coming in
you cant blame him
yeah well technically jim
he hasnt looked like himself all season
i mean he started off on fire
that weve seen throughout most of his nfl career
isnt this the worst
what
and he can test me
i never wanna see him struggle
and we both know hes had his struggles
you never stop rooting for them
thanks to anderson fisher

 your mom is a little  passionate
and now the saints head to the end zone on a quick strike
and its caught touchdown falcons
taylor with a perfect throw
thats how you gotta score against this defense
handoff coleman and he fumbles it
and the saints recover
all of last weeks troubles not quite behind him
saints are feeling comfortable in enemy territory

this time…
across west central and southern africa
over the centuries there has been many assumptions about mami wata
until now
zinwe
zinwe
i’ve been hearing that since i was little
youre the intermediary in iyi
what cant you do
how do you refuse to help that woman
mother
if it was me
when i become the intermediary
i will abolish all this foolishness from iyi
youre a marine child too zinwe
i was infertile
thats when mami wata gave you to me
thats the way things are
i cant believe
that you would lie
just because you want to remain intermediary
aja
zinwe lets go home
theres fewer people coming
they come to say ndenk thank you
so they can leave with blessings
i didnt start it
zinwe
lets go home
our people need you
you know youll be the intermediary
iyi
i cant take zinwe anymore
that child doesnt listen
iyi no longer believes in mother
what do you want prisca
what you want it counts
the people of iyi are my people
i dont know anything beyond this place
thats all i want
lets dance
can i enter
you know that i scream
 no mother is sleeping  okay
she no longer has any power
where are you going
you say you have powers
show us
where is mami watas power where is it
and you give everything but when you need help
listen other villages have progressed
they have electricity
they have schools
they have running water
they have hospitals that would have been able to save agbos son
and what do we have
we have mama efe
mama efe
is it true that zinwe stole your totem and ran away
maybe she has answered us
i am mama efe
she is prisca
she is the one who saved you
you are in iyi
administering these vaccines
and your daughter invited us to administer them to your people
we received an unfortunate report involving a young boy
god rest his soul
there is no virus in my village
 yes but you see  no but mister doctor
protected you say how so
all you men of western science
what do you know beyond your books
you know nothing about the worlds beyond what you can see with your eyes
mother
this man is a doctor who wants to save our children
so they wont die
doctor
i know you allowed him to give his medicine to our people
dont worry
maybe she has answered us
this food is delicious
prisca prepared it
since ive been here theres something that i have noticed in your village
and no army or police as far as i can see
when we have mami wata
its mami wata who gives us food and everything we need
theyve forgotten who they are
but here in iyi we know who we are
but you still havent told us who you are
mother
i will speak
my name is jasper
we are the ones they call rebel
how you saved me and brought me to this beautiful place
and the princess
gave me this delicious meal to eat
i i wanted to thank you
or as you say ndenk thank you
still i appreciate it
dont be offended its a compliment
there is something i didnt tell you two
the rebels they
killed my wife
after they had raped her
 prisca  hello
your people really love you
its really beautiful
youre lucky to live here
i wish i could live here
my body is all healed up
if they hadn’t sent me away i would be dead
mama efe adopted me and brought me to iyi
some say that mami wata gave zinwe to mama efe
and no one knows who zinwes father is
you know how these things go
what do you believe
maybe zinwes father has a wife
better not say i told you that
if zinwe is truly mami watas
im just surprised that you dont believe the things your mother believes
i dont know what i believe
all i know is my mother and my people
anything else doesnt concern me
no prayer can change it
you are jasper
fancy a drink
enjoy
look at them
and give it all to mama efe
so she can enjoy it with her daughter in their big house
mother
mumbles incoherently
where are you going
mother
zinwes destiny
lies beyond here
no prayer
no prayer can stop it
no prayer no prayer can change it
as it is
my time is up
i was dreaming
and in my dream
its prisca who annoys me the most
she drives her motorcycle like she poops gold from her ass
what annoys me the most is her devotion to mami wata
in a war
they will speak
willingly go into battle
they are the worst
what i know is their time will soon come
the time has passed where they use mami wata to blind peoples eyes
me i see
i see very clearly
theres someone there
run
theres someone there
help zinwe to see
run run run
i told you that their time has come
get the children out of here
get out
you dont know what youre doing
you say youre the intermediary
she doesnt know
mami wata didnt tell her
jasper
is this how you treat
the person who saved you and took you into their home
you join those who want to kill her
i follow no one i only follow myself
 everything youre saying  mama efe
your time has come
we want progress
 your time has come  yes
jasper are you coming
lots of good stuff inside
we own this place now
in short we own this village now
but since im not a wicked man
ill allow you all to continue living here
weve counted them
so you two can choose who you like
but mama efes room belongs to me and you
im the boss here
if anyone has a problem with that they should speak now
zinwe is back
 please run away  please dont go
zinwe
welcome back oh queen
mama efe is no more
wait
mama efe and all the intermediaries before her
have bamboozled you with stories of mami wata
but have you seen her
has anyone here seen her
when sickness comes she cant save you
and i hear she takes your food your money
is that fair
jabi told me that you want electricity running water roads schools hospitals
you know that mama efe could never give you all that
mama efe is dead
prisca has run away abandoning you all right
but zinwe is here
now if shes going to be the intermediary
and if truly mami wata exists
as youve been told by mama efe
if that happens then truly zinwe is the intermediary
but if we throw her into the water and she doesnt come out
theres a reason why im here
ill be here but not like mama efe
i killed your mother
mami wata foolishness
whatever is that mami wata
it is all nonsense
 whats inside  bullshit
bring your money and goods
and your goods
bring your money
and your goods
bring your money and goods
ndenk
we will use this to purchase better weapons
what kind of weapons
where is jaspers house
johnny boy
big man jasper
seems like youre doing well
hey careful big man
there you go again
that man killed our mother and would have killed you
i know that
while those who claim to be my people stood and watched
you are not afraid prisca
what i know is that
we will fight and win against jasper and his men
and you zinwe
will be the intermediary in iyi
blessings have died in iyi
what did i ask you to enter
why is the food rotten
blessings have died in iyi
boss jasper
they deceived everyone in iyi
 prisca  ero
i thought you ran away from iyi
we buried your mother
but jasper cast it away
i know youre mad at me
for being with him
please
forgive me
they deceived everyone in iyi
build hospitals
bring electricity
so the people gave them their money and their goods
but jasper used them to buy many guns
i saw that
all this would not have happened
my mother would still be alive
they killed zinwe
please dont be mad at me
i wanted to fight
its like when a person dies and resurrects
so truly mami wata saved her
 prisca  i choose prisca
go zinwe
isnt that priscas bike
thats priscas bike

prisca is here you upright
where is prisca speak
hello prisca
what is this foolishness

jabi you were afraid of him he is a woman
jasper show us your pussy
prisca

what belongs to me
the totem

gunter wait their
general von ouerbach

and i have complete faith in your integrity
oh well im sorry to say
i have no doubt about my decision
would you mind asking your boy not to meddle with my instruments
gunter
and his majesty king fredrik vilhelm
these rumors must be uprooted
superstition gnaws into the mind of the people
nils lindgren a brilliant young man from sweden
whom the court holds in high esteem
there is no further need for you to visit our residence
everything is normal no need to worry
good day madame
yes i know but this time its not necessary
sir
please
done
maria is among them
she speaks of the dead as if they were seeds to plant
should such thoughts be given credence
i couldnt stop reading this
 thanks for letting me take these letters home  thats good
yeah
look were finally scanning the book and the letters
they shine a completely new light on anmuths work
its like studying anatomy through a poem
you dont know what your getting yourself into
i wasnt sure that i should come
i understand theres a new physician who will work by your side
a month has passed since my last menses
 i cant  johan
i must go
how is valentin
well his heads always in the clouds
valentin
be silent witch or ill deal with you myself
if you are not capable of looking after your own servant i will
that witch is leading valentin astray do you understand
spending time with her is the last thing my son needs
and you will see that it takes form and becomes clear
see valentin is looking there far ahead
learn to look through a spyglass heinrich von ouerbach
and then you will see your son clearly
ever since then a part of me still dwells in her rooms
but i need to understand why was anmuth replaced by a younger doctor
and why did ouerbach who was his sponsor
it reveals the transition between ancient and modern medicine
the young doctor in england
who studied in halle in prussia
and he didnt even believe in touching his patients bodys
lets study the letters some more
something must be here
why dont we talk about it more over a drink
mmm hmm
thanks
we finally reached our jam session moment
anyone
i want to sing
do you know candy says
of course yeah you sing well follow
candy says
 im gonna watch the blue birds fly 
 over my shoulder 
 what do you think id see 
thank you
here
come in
youre not the first woman to faint in my arms you know
no flowers
i brought something else
look i know i shouldnt give this to you
but i just have to
see you later
thank you
bye
maria
maria is there something troubling you
why so sad
my mother is dying
let me be clear i dont believe any of this nonsense
but i will go to your mother
she may be irresponsible but she is truly an unfortunate
to hell with lindgren
maria im sorry but your mother has died
in times like these it is more important to talk about the dead than about the living
 talk about the living and the dead  maria please calm down
nobody listens to me
tell my story and the story of the dead
give us the soul that we deserve
maria i forbid you to leave the house
well you did
well this is a first
so eva
i gather you have a research scholarship at our university
what is your chosen field
interesting
really
i just think eva wanted to express her own
you should be thinking of the future
and how to deal with the very real problems we are face
well i like to question the present the past and the future
i know exactly what im doing but i think its really my own business
 why  you two
you were sparkling today
not get into arguments too early in the game
i like to watch the back and forth
but why would you hold back at all
know how to deal with things on the surface
its like surfing
its the only way i can be myself with somebody i care about
with somebody whos worth it
like you
stop it
very good stellan
yeah you have too many lucky days
i need to tell you something
the point is eva is my patient
and shes also pregnant did you know that
she has to terminate the pregnancy
otherwise both her and the baby could die
stellan stellan
im not conscious of my motives in writing this volume
yet another might be a martyr burned in fire because his nature
is to defy and to dissolve into the flames
when can we know that our motives are sincere
only when our actions are not part of our nature
and how can we be sure that our actions are not within our nature
maria why dont you speak
i need you to talk to me please
i tell her to stop
she doesnt listen
she whispers in my ear
she tells me of a tragedy
of a child
a little boy
valentin
burn it all
over there too
valentin no
the deep waters of the lake swallowed his body
stellan
whats wrong
i looked for you all day yesterday and your phone was turned off
youve been studying this book for months
whats going on
you have bigger problems
morgan told me
youre pregnant
no not if you risking your life
my baby wont hurt me i know that
well be fine
youre crazy
valentin
my sons death described in every detail
how could he have written something like this
i think hes hes losing his mind sir
he gave credence to that evil woman he started writing down her visions
how did you come by these
pay it no mind madam there the words of a madman
elizabeth elizabeth
my sweet
whats happened mother
nothings happened
valentin is not to leave the residence
and you youre old enough to look after your brother now
try to love him
dont worry mother
elizabeth come here
elizabeth
servants servants
please breathe slowly
all those things we never said to each other theyre not lost
i can not live without your love
hes a beautiful boy just the way you imagined him
no you cant go in there
and by will of general heinrich von ouerbach
no you cant do this no let go of me
no
please dont hurt him
no one must see your behavior
no no
the soldiers will say she died of fever
people who hate her will be glad but no one ever truly dies
in any case theyve taken him away by now
the tree where you meet is no longer there
thats not true
keep your eyes open wide open
so wide that you hold your breath
just a glimmer of understanding as you walk down a new path
the babys fine
and before we get to that point we have to do something about your heart
and the sooner the better
robot surgery will be less traumatic for you but
im not afraid
not any more
thats what happened between you and me
the things we never said to each other
theyre not lost
every step every error every secret brought me here
this is an intolerable situation for you
you shouldnt be alone
and you belong to me
what do you know about love
alright im going back to the hospital now
im gonna sit behind that machine and do whatever i can for her
i dont know whats gonna happen but what i do know
is that what im doing i will do with love
or you can play your part and share in the kind of love
my dear johan i never could have imagined
nothing will ever be the same
i do not know how you were able to predict these events
where are your words now
my lord
master gunter
forgive me
for you mother
mr morgan were ready for you when you are
can elevate his mind to such a degree as to perceive the world of the angels
the ability to put our head in the clouds
reaching for a new vision
and here i am
good luck little boy
who sacrificed her life while protecting gujarat
nonviolence is the real principle
dont forget that the kingdom remains united with the fear of sword
heavy to me
alright
ajaypal
lilukumari
ajaypal singh has all the rights over patans throne
arent son and daughters rights same in your principle
and the same time can also countercoup
whats worrying you
sometimes even the internal factors
come to you before its too dark
ajaylpal solanki
now see
this chapter is still incomplete
the glorious king mulraj singh solanki established the solanki era
king im the same trilochan shresthi
come to the point
trilochan
the prince must get married immediately
king
if you allow me can i suggest something
was married to princess minaldevi
princess nayika devi
praise be to sati mother sati
princess
what tradition is this
how will the widow attain salvation
henceforth your name is kalyani
real love happens at first sight
then you will forget your friend too
and from bhuj to malwa no princely state can dare insult patan
insult that…
war is not the solution to every problem
the queen is right
how can a mother like me tolerate this
i feel like going to the battlefield right away
no shresthi
not all wars are won with the fights
queen
kadumb will face the deadly outcome
shes also very stubborn king
how can we be in danger when we are with shiva
im sure this was patans conspiracy
impossible
is it so
kumar ajaypal singh
weve reached patan princess
daughterinlaw nayika devi pays respect to…
modesty and manners
insult
the greatest warrior named mulraj singh solanki
this patan is my pride devi
a part of our court of ministers…
queen nayika devi
may solanki rule… always triumph
kingdom of kashi
how are you sahastrakala
you have to guide ghori towards patan
and if she fails
forgive me for my mistake his highness
gulfan has always served ghoris his whole life
that gulfam has to serve
never
have mercy on me
sultan
sultan you grabbed my palace
ive nothing left to give you sultan
ive nothing to give you spare my son
no sultan no
no sultan
butcher
no…
have mercy on me sultan…
shes a little sharp
bring her to me
sure his highness
where were you going girl
greetings trilochan shresthi
welcome malvas king vijjaldev
how can i avoid your order trilochan shresthi
order
you have to order me
its suffocating to live like this
after pratapmals coronation ceremony
lion looked at ghori
ghori looked at the lion
lion jumped towards ghori
listen to this his highness
the moment tiger took a leap towards ghori
thank you
they are just…
buttering you up
forget about defeating it
it was impossible to enter
win over patan
i was very young
one day queen bhopaldes convoy was passing from the city
i was so happy watching all that
the moment…
i wish to be a queen one day
for the first time in my life i felt insulted
for such a small thing
i will rule patan one day
ghori will win patan
you give its charge to your slave and move ahead
to make you my slave
time hasnt passed
at the same shiva temple
dont you think
friend
make sure that the subjects should know
before patan loses its selfconfidence
queen
king ajayapal singh always ignored your behavior and your conspiracies
leave for king kumarpals ashram right now
he doesnt need any enemy for his own destruction
greetings
no
but i met the commanderinchief
will you not
queen mother shes sahastrakala
alright
that you belong to ghori
does patan treat its guest like this
guest
i dont need them anymore
give it back
king return it to me kalyani
this is a dancing horse
riding this horse when a king goes to fight
and the king…
shahabuddin ghori has already left from multan
i had come to patan to create conflicts in your administration
i wanted…
should i laugh on your foolishness or have mercy
queen mother
and it will always be
may goddess protect patan
sahastrakal has been killed
his words will sharpen our swords
listen to him
we will meet
before the war…
it is against ghoris nature
wear these bangles that ive sent
because a woman manages the house
my dagger is enough to win patan
enough
but every woman of this world
i will not step on the land of patan
they will take four to six days to encamp from there
ghoris camp is in arbuda
and the war is already prohibited…
ghori will create havoc in patan
together will also be less
because we always waited for them to attack first
before they unsheathe their swords we would have made our first attack
that i live in the salty region
one day a man saw his death before him
death told him
he stopped at an isolated and deserted place
but when he opened his eyes
even death said…
whereas you were destined to die here
almighty has decided this place for nayika devis death
and gave me the responsibility
that anybody would shiver with the sight of it
i will bury solankis in arbuda
shamsher
and i will face her directly on the battle field
i want nayika devi alive
such pride
queen mother
is heading through the valley
if gazanavi and solanki had a war
its our chance to erase the stigma on the solanki dynastys administration
hey children of patans
because ghori has come here for his ambition
whereas weve come here to protect our motherland
hail lord shiva
attack
attack
hail lord shiva
hail lord shiva
nor a womans honor
end my life
i pardon you life
that neither you will live…
 maybe maybe this time 
 we gonna get it right imma get it right 
 maybe maybe this time 
 maybe maybe this time 
 we gonna get it right imma get it right 
 maybe maybe this time 
 imma burn it down

look
not only did mercator create that atlas he kept it his whole life
mercator left small comments in some of his books
annotations crumb trails  a crumb trail to what
may i
no the golden fleece
this is from a greek myth right
geez how long have you been working on this  he mentions a solar eclipse
thats insignificant he talks about the golden fleece
excuse me
alchemy no way  what
if this mercator was able to make gold then why cant we do that anymore today
because the emperor wanted to keep it secret
so charles vi had to silence him he
he even sent the inquisition after him  the what
the inquisition a kind of catholic faith police
thank you  they sound like fun
the inquisition even locked mercator up but he didnt keep quiet
thats why mercator hid small clues about the fleece in his work
in his maps  his books
yes
the golden fleece is still hidden somewhere
mercators crumb trail can lead us to it
thats why i would like to search that atlas for clues
right but now i do
its captain  captain
yes
but only if slien and i can come
right
get in
wow
slien  isnt it lovely
slien  what
an old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere what if hes a serial killer

captain
yes  im okay im okay
because of him  we havent lost anything
vlassenbrouck

a good map can tell you everything
a satnav is much easier
no entry road ben  the name is benjamin
in 100 metres turn left
turn left  that was a driveway
no
if we dont sink
i knew we had to turn left
benji
sorry
something inconspicuous
something inconspicuous  yes
and
nothing
are your specs telling you that  yes they are
it was only rebuilt in 1603 thats ten years after mercators death
we wont find anything  ben
benjamin  yes
you still got that photo  of course i do
there careful eh  sure
perhaps there was something on the reverse
no no there was nothing on there i checked i did
so
not enough
stop going on about the solar eclipse  yes and wikipedia

exsurge domine
touché
arise oh lord and judge your own case
touché  benji
touché  oh benji

touché
its a different metal  i believe that belongs to me
so it still exists
but in the end i always win
never mind
oh will you
are you going to pull out the thumbscrews again perhaps
we have moved with the times mr stephorst
the days of the inquisition are long gone
you cant dictate what people have to think anymore
people think for themselves now
people live in the illusion that they think for themselves
and who determines what they see on there
it shouldnt remain a secret
are you going to hand out gold nuggets then
i have a cramp
i dont think so  cramps gone
no no
no
yes
no  shit slien the boat
hey
choke  what
pull the choke  pull the choke

because i want to know what happened to your father
whatever
benjamin
hey

that he wasnt coming back

can he breathe in there and
i had constant nightmares
sorry
its okay
thats just some old junk
kurrel and zeppos take art back to congo
kurrel and zeppos the big interview
he left you his story
but it doesnt tell us what really happened
there is someone else who knew your father
rest assured
good
it is vitally important
and if they do they need to be destroyed
why  because our organisation has sworn
to protect the secret of the fleece barral
and weve kept that secret so well that nobody knows where it is even we dont
exsurge domine
exsurge domine
i will destroy the atlas
monica we are not doing that
a secret is but a secret if its kept

and
and
what is your plan ben
jamin
we should look for the virgin mary in vlassenbroek
this is vlassenbroek in satellite images
he drew vlassenbroek on the wrong bank on purpose
we couldnt continue the search without our walking wikipedia could we
you couldve given up
look they can set fire to that fleece for all i care
i just want to know what happened to my dad

an astrolabe
celine look theres a very small inscription
atlas europae  thats our atlas
a flood  no no no

like in indiana jones  could be
i wouldnt stay there for a second near that cursed island
its not on any map but i saw it with my own eyes
and youre sure stephorst was on board
yes but the skipper dropped them at the island
i should have gone with him
this
basically the first pocket computer
it really was it can measure the altitude of stars
or tell you what time it is look you keep it as steady as possible
vega
of course youd need a different plate for every location in the world
i think that plate was made for this location
perhaps there was another clue in mercators letter
guys
its a ram
oh right
is that the secret formula  perhaps yes
are these the same symbols as on the fleece
pew
its cobalt  cobalt
yes
what  cobalt
he needs it to make his computers and phones
youre good at this kurrel

the fleece had to remain secret

by the time we were married
jamie depended on me for absolutely everything
he needed me and to be honest i needed him too
id looked after him for so long hed become my whole life
shes had too many
i was jamies reason for living
but katherine thought i was a treacherous gold digger
lina
my beloved daughterinlaw
which i did not see coming
whod have thought that when you turned up here…
…a helpless waif and stray
completely dependent on my kindness that…
that youd end up…
to jamie and lina
to jamie and lina
 showing off  shes not
she was nice to you before we got engaged suddenly starts treating you like shit
 what does that tell you hmm  jamie
this house thats all she cares about
exactly anyone would think its all about her

oh okay
youre not the one who prescribed him the painkillers are you
im nurse mackenzie im neuroclinical
i mean i deal with anyone who comes in here with neurological problems
including grand mal seizures
between his pain meds and his seizure medication
and youll know that 80 milligrams of codeine is hardly a responsible dosage
to give to someone who appears
i think we should give the family some peace and quiet
all right
be right back
i dont appreciate people casting professional aspersions on me
no i was just
to make judgments about the patients reliance on pain medication
im his gp youre a nurse
show some respect
mr carter
is under my care now
come in
lina
excuse me not at all please come in
i think he did it to punish me
to fix someone that doesnt wanna be fixed…
…or admitting that…
its none of my business
but when was the last time you had any fun
cant remember
somewhere hot
drink till you fall over
dance a lot
preferably the samba or the rumba
or possibly the mumba
the mumba
doctors orders

im okay its just a cut looks worse than it is
sorry
when i took you in you had nothing

i got out of poverty she didnt
i became a hollywood star
i didnt let it affect our friendship but uh…
why would she do that
she broke my heart
sadly not the last
you abandoned her
if she told you that she lied
my mom wasnt a jealous person
sorry to disappoint you lina
but i was the one who maintained our relationship for your sake
i was the one who flew you out to california on school holidays

why are we also searching for her
for the past seven years we are searching for him
we searched every nook and corner of the country

why did his mother react so much over a plastic knife
why doesnt he cross the boundaries set by his mother
and what is this
hold on to the pole
what
obulamma
hold on to the pole tightly
he has stopped the truck
someone stopped the truck
who the heck is he
the person who stopped the vehicle is
devaratha
no one can do anything to him
give it
you can stop a river with a dam but
how can you stop a mighty ocean
i never told you about this obulamma
he should have been killed the moment he was found right
but no one can do anything to him
and made sure that devaratha stops that truck
the people who want to kill you
your father
him his mother
me
khansaar
you know whose seal that is
for the first time ever
varadha
varadha rajamannaar
no one other than him can stop it
deva
but what changed the fate of khansaar was
when two best friends
and only one will survive
no one can stop that seal
the salaar to varadha rajamannaar
salaar devaratha raisaar
what happens now
its the rule he defined
no one can break it
up up
i am here for you
some stories are frightening to watch
some stories are frightening to listen to
but this story is
frightening to even think of
this story began a thousand years ago
they would not just loot a village
an8khansaar
an8there were three tribes among those dacoits
an8the mannaar tribe
an8the shouryaanga tribe
the three tribes flourished and prospered unchallenged for hundreds of years
they turned the forest into a formidable fortress
fire
the british who could reign over the entire world
could occupy the whole of india but
in khansaar
after independence the newly formed nation had a huge issue
erasing khansaar from the indian map
money generated through all the illegal activities in india
petroleum fake currency
and were operated by their agents
to prevent the law and order from interfering with their activity
they began to dictate politics
fear
with this weapon they had created
people feared to even say the name khansaar
they turned this business which was run with fear
fully aware of the violent nature of the tribes shivmannaar
drafting a set of rules to be strictly adhered to by everyone
and according to that constitution
he divided khansaar into 101 parts
he crafted a bracelet as a symbol representing a leader
eight leaders with at least three votes each as lords
one day shivmannaar died
the leader of the shouryaanga tribe dhaara had to rule khansaar
but rajamannaar never wanted to give away his fathers throne to anyone else
not a single soul from the shouryaanga tribe should be spared
can we confront them
there is only one way to kill them all
men women kith and kin
they must be killed while they are asleep spare no one
the shouryaangas vengeance is unimaginable
why
that day the entire shouryaanga tribe was completely eliminated
he built the biggest walls around khansaar
assembled the largest armies
and made khansaar the most powerful place ever
vaali
gurung
cheeka
ranga
and naarang
om rajamannaars first wifes elder brother
bhaarava rajamannaars soninlaw
rudra rajamannaars son by his first wife
radha rama
rajamannaars daughter by his first wife
rajamannaars honor and pride
had been suppressing their nature for 25 years
until that day
father is it true
temples are built to propagate religion
kingdoms are ruled to propagate legacy
khansaar is built to propagate only one thing
fear
i have maintained it until now
no one should cross that line of fear
who has crossed that line now
okay father
my king
i know that nobody will disobey your decisions
when will you forgive him
varadha
answer me why
he threw away the honor i gave him
he lost his right to be my son
but he was just a tenyearold
why are you concerned about it
he also deserves the honor which rudra gets
for the first time i am making a decision for myself
all i want is one of your chairs
hence i am asking you
ranga
varadha
he couldnt become a lord since then
though he is designated as a governor
he always lived with the confidence of a lord
you shouldnt ask me my king
you should only command me
yes my king
your father picked up the bracelet he threw on the ground
how can i give away my chair
give it up
ranga
cannot be defied
there is another order more powerful than rajamannaars orders
khansaar constitution
and in that book there is a very important rule
the strongest shall
rule
tomorrow it could be my turn
i will defeat you and you defeat me
let us fight
the strongest shall prevail
rule
is rudra off to kill varadha
rudra has sent for pandit
pandit
when rajamannaar returns
but by the time rajamannaar returns
the strongest shall prevail
ranga
but i want the mannaar tribe pride he is wearing
the constitution
rudra its the constitution
no one should disobey it
who stopped me
hey
in his presence or absence
no one should raise their voice or run their mouth
because i am representing the king now and thats why all of you are still alive
if the decision was mine
bali
madam
between the lords and the governors of khansaar
i am imposing a ceasefire
a ceasefire is imposed in khansaar from today
the constitution
all stand equal before the khansaar constitution
i rudra rajamannaar
as per the khansaar constitution
after nine days the decision of whether the ceasefire
should be imposed or not will be taken
an8no one wanted to wait until the voting day
rudra has called for pandit
naarang has assembled the russians
gurung has assembled the serbians
you tell me
how many are we bringing
tell me
brother tell me please
where is our army
we also set out to bring an army
in just one jeep and with only one vacant seat
hey deva
deva
your voice might have changed
but the way you call me hasnt
varadha rajamannaar
cook something for me
hey
would you
who took it
mother
 i think varadha needs me  but
go with him
please let go of her
only one
isnt there anyone else sir
i didnt call anyone else
surabhi
devaratha
take his prints
i am praying to our goddess to save us
surabhi no matter how much we pray no gods step foot on this sinful land
be careful sir
never come out
what are you doing now
huge walls are built out of fear
not out of fear of those going out
you said gods wont come for us
so i am praying in the opposite way
only one
you brought only one man
we needed a whole army and you brought just one
did you make all the arrangements for devas stay here
yes i did
have you forgotten
our lives are so miserable even today
inform satthi that the curry is not spicy enough
deva wont like it
everyone in khansaar desperately
wants to hack us to pieces
you didnt have to take such a desperate decision now
and fulfill my wish of seeing you as a lord
until now i have been fulfilling your wishes without you asking for it
just fulfill this one wish of mine
lord
rudra mannaar has sent you a message
lord rudra sent a message
please call deva as well
hey come
go get him
go
lord
why are you walking my lord
i also know we are surrounded only by enemies all over
hey
what is it
more than the fear of getting killed
in khansaar nothing can be calculated by using a calculator
thats why i brought a maniac who cant be calculated
hold the gun tight
safety
thats it right
lets go
mother
ganga
rudra on one hand and ranga on the other
do one thing
its my mistake
i didnt notice
how long can he hold himself back
hey leave me
khansaars king rajamannaars son
varadha rajamannaar
i have absolutely no value here
deva please sit down please
lets go
hey come here my dearest brother
brother let me go brother
baachi
not that something will happen to me
you must make sure nothing happens to him
hey
you must
deva
you have six hands and yet
we are in deep anguish
and you are nowhere to be seen
why do you harbor anger
against the fragile
to hail you with raised arms
there is no strength left
even with ceaseless worship we remain untouched by mercy
we called you again and again
yet hope has faded away
an8along with rudra ranga and bhaarava another ten governors have teamed up
they will also try to influence the others to take their side
good
but my lord
you cannot win without the ghaniyaars
and none of the ghaniyaars will go against their leader naarang
naarang
what if ranga tries to influence some of the ghaniyaars to take his side
even if one of the leaders from my tribe goes against our king
 children naarang  what
children
boy
girl
girl
hey pandit
we cant touch him now
girl
i also have a wish
a wish of a father unlike our king rajamannaars
this bloody
hey tell him
hey deva shouldnt come there
vishnu has a procedure
first he flies the kite high
then he cuts the string himself
the kite lands on
he takes one girl from that house
oh god no
first get inside go inside
oh no
oh yeah we got our chick
you are too young just keep quiet
i am going thats it
no one is stopping me swear on me
oh no
it doesnt matter who goes im a dead woman either way
o goddess save us please please
surabhi
i cannot bear the suspense
hey who called him here
hey
follow the procedure
stand with your hands folded
good
sir please spare her
sir please spare her
sir sir
she is just a kid
where did you all go today leaving me behind
i beg you my lord
vishnu chooses a hen every day
and kills it
please dont destroy her life
leave her alone
just give us two minutes dear lord
o goddess kateramma
from the herd select a nice and healthy ram with strong twisted horns
hey stop it
dear lord
then sharpen the sword against a rock
water should be sprinkled on its face
mutthu
as soon as it shakes its head
hey
kill him
hack him to death
surabhi
goddess kateramma didnt come
instead
brother he will kill vishnu
varadha stop him right now
he wont stop
until that guy stops breathing
he wont stop
baba
tell him to stop baba
how dare you
kill that scoundrel
just two minutes
vishnu has been killed
was it him
why did deva react so violently for someone he didnt even know
i understand
he sees his mother
how dare he touch the girl
a kid at that
sorry
whatever he did that day
affected not only us
this shouldnt be happening
especially during the ceasefire
it was the new guy
rudra
since it was the new guy who flouted the rules
you must convince naarang to punish the culprit
if varadha dies i will be happy
but i must follow my dad the kings command
uncle i will speak to naarang
please go to varadha immediately
rudra
i havent asked you for anything since childhood
do something please
i want varadha
tomorrow at velamgadi
naarang is going to pronounce the verdict
dont open your mouth
my lord
varadha didnt kill your son
remember that
my lord
my lord
if we want to lift the ceasefire
naarang has to go against rajamannaar
and kill varadha
but
when your son was mercilessly being hacked to death
the verdict at velamgadi today
an8dont move until further orders
until i say no weapons should be used
somebodys head will roll today
as soon as it is done come and inform me
i will take care of everything there
but you must remain silent
understand
this is the guy who knocked off vishnu
i believe he killed as many as 25
will it be his head or varadhas today
he is going towards varadha bro
hey
he is going to kill your rooster
deva
deva
do whatever you want with me dont touch varadha sir
i did it
dont touch varadha sir
deva
deva listen to me
stop right there
sir
i killed vishnu with these hands
hey
kill me
please dont touch varadha sir
hey get back
sir
he didnt do anything
its all because of me
kill me
i told you
i told you not to touch him
what are you looking at
load your guns
no one touches him
please
i
kindly
request
is it varadhas head
or the new guy
you muted me in khansaar
maybe he doesnt know the rules
of course it was
varadha said it correctly
seriously he got himself a maniac
before devaratha was brought here we were on a frying pan
getting our lives fried and burnt every day
he killed the son
and threw us into the fire
but no
what he will do next is
suspense
what
brother brother brother
what was that
i forgot i forgot i forgot
can you remind me
tell me
hey
hey brother hey brother tell me
i warned him not to touch you
he paid no heed
you heard me right
how could he touch you
sorry
i should be saying sorry
it was all my fault
no matter what happens here
i didnt want to involve you and restrained myself several times
but i couldnt anymore
you would have done great anywhere but here
sorry
what could be more important to dad than this
he doesnt answer my calls at all
there are 101 votes in total
since naarang and vishnu are dead
they will invalidate their four votes
we cannot trust the remaining voters
zorani acharya mishra akram pasha shukla
i will bring them
but you must hand over varadha to me after the voting
including the king
forty eight
forty eight
we have tried all combinations
we also subjected them to intense torture
the color red triggers them
hey get up
we need varadhas vote also
i have despised you ever since
but for this obstacle
everything will go as i expected
if you vote to lift the ceasefire
a man goes to any extent for something he loves
but for something he hates he goes even beyond that
i hated you even before my younger brother did
i will definitely divert all my hatred towards the one you love the most
badri
madam
if things dont go as i say tomorrow
drag his brother out and behead him once the voting is over
if you have even an ounce of rajamannaars blood in you
you will make the right decision
bhaarava i am very scared
do you think voting will go as we expect
it has to
and it will
finally its our time
following the discussion on ceasefire nine days ago
and finally the king shall use their voting right
those who want the ceasefire to end
an8shall place their bracelets with tickets on the left side
an8those who want the ceasefire to continue
the voting shall begin now
the voting should end within the given time
governor 1
governor 10
governor 6 governor 13
governor 17
governor 33
governor 21
no information on the king yet
his flight arrival is not scheduled at khansaar
now the lords will cast their votes
and the verdict on ceasefire will be announced
shivmannaars son
khansaars king rajamannaar returns
since its a tie with 48 votes on each side
the verdict shall be based on varadha rajamannaars vote
make your disgrace complete now
others voting is not in our hands
it doesnt matter what they think
isnt it enough
khansaar must turn red
either with blazing fire
or with their blood
thank you
with your advice
i too have
the mannaar blood flowing through my veins
tonight at 1201 am
now the rooster is yours
they lifted the ceasefire
against them
i mean how
but the most important problem was to survive the night
get everyone out
begin with his younger brother
sharpen the swords
come
people only talk about hunting tigers
more than tigers i like to watch how wild dogs hunt
do you know what a wild dog does
and i would relish the sight
now they have renewed hope to live
after a long time
they have started worshiping again
nothing will happen to them
hey
bend it and whet it
it must cut through his bones
all that i can see around you
is death sir
do you see it too
its done sir
where are they all going
they must have found something redder sir
have you ever seen the hunters being hunted
but he was born mad
why are you so late
the tattoo took some time
i would have hacked them all by now
why didnt you come back here for 25 years
why havent you called me back here for 25 years
i should have
hey
have you made friends there
many
more good looking than you
but they are girlfriends
i have some too
but i beat more people than you
move it
we are all violent men
violence is in our blood
for 25 years i kept the trait suppressed which is 1000 years old
i have a childhood story
this was bound to happen some day
the ceasefire was only an excuse to fight amongst themselves
and dream that one day all this would be mine
enough fighting for land and honor
whatever i can see
i want it
everyone is after my chair
that is exactly why they will join hands
will be our own blood
how can i kill my own blood uncle
what makes you think that uncle and rudra will join hands against you
why do you think rudra invited pandit
secondly
who
vaali
an8do you know why rajamannaar obliterated an entire tribe
an8but spared us the ghaniyaars
because we have no unity
if we stand united
thiru
thirdly
more terrible than the other two
the sin i committed 25 years ago has come back to hunt me down
tell me
where are they
where is bhaarava
bhaarava
your husband is not a mannaar as you believe
then
do you know why i built such huge walls around khansaar
who
the shouryaangas
and yet do you know how carefully they hid us
an8wait wait wait
wait wait
what
all the while causing internal conflicts in khansaar to weaken it
we still feel the pain
we have been living in hiding
we have changed our names
we have changed our identity
all for this day
if you dont eliminate your enemy by tonight
the constitution
you beheaded our deity
all the shouryaangas are eagerly waiting there
except one
you
remember dhaara
but you killed him
but
his son is alive
you must leave immediately
why did you
but he has returned by himself
only one
vishnu was killed
was it him
our leader
shouryaanga
wait wait wait
not just at the khansaar gates but throughout the city
whoa
on the other thousands of shouryaangas were ready to burn the chair down
but
deva
does deva know about this
if he finds out
no one should survive
salaar
one two one two…
one two one two…

my heart aches
and today lets be reborn
well be dumb
and fly through the air

before i realized it i wasnt even holding my violin
what a weird dream
oneeyed
oneeyed scary
i was so desperate to find my violin but i couldnt find it
yeah i have dreams where im looking for things too
then before i knew it that oneeyed thing got closer
thats so scary it was just staring at me
so creepy
then i realized it was just a dream
i jumped off
what
have you ever fallen asleep in class and woken up with a jerk
i have…
right yeah
so id thought i would wake up if i jumped off the building
you just went all out
what does it mean
oh thanks

ive had that dream before…
huh
taki never came back after that
i dont care who it is it can be anybody
not voices…
i was good friends with taki
we both didnt fit in at school
our classes electives and path home were the same
we both quit orchestra at the same time
i really liked it
taki was the first best friend i ever had
they suddenly appear from the other side and before we know it were taken away
stay with me today too
stay with me today too
you guys
you guys took me in
i dont remember it
but your face tells me you want to say something
everything in my sight
everything here is all fake
even if youre compassionate even if youve given up
try hard to bite your tongue
stay there and shut up
its a lie if i say its exactly as i imagined
you were sentimental
thats not like you
but that expression on you
that expression for just a moment
reflected beautifully in my eyes
for the longest time i yearned for you and i almost lost myself
overcome the real thing if youre scared
stay with me today too
they suddenly appear from the other side and before we know it were taken away
stay with me today too
for the longest time i yearned for you and i almost lost myself
overcome the real thing…
did you have that weird dream
what is that
i told you yesterday
the oneeyed monster the oneeyed monster
the oneeyed monster
the oneeyed monster
the oneeyed monster
the oneeyed monster
we went to karaoke cafés and arcades
taki took me everywhere
the room where the two of us would sing karaoke
you say youre not a part of this
no matter what were not a good match
laugh at the prank cheers to your face
i cant tell sweet and sour apart
im lost in front of you
melting away its a rendezvous
itll be platonic
its a slightly bitter expectation my heart might break
hey taki
dont play with my heart and look away
a pink heart forecast
if i tell you now tell you now
well be one and our gazes will fill with love
i was a transfer student
but it never bothered her
we werent good at having conversations with other people
we didnt speak a word but we could understand each other
oh no its gonna end what
one two wait for the signal…
but…
only when i was with taki could i speak so naturally
taki told me the same thing
and i thought i could be with her for the rest of my life

more and more i hate it but i like it
more and more i hate it but i like it

im glad that was just a dream that scared me
it happened at those stairs seriously
really yeah
did somebody push you
not sure youre not sure
but im glad youre here taki
its okay im right here
it was so scary
i thought she would disappear one day
im sorry taki
i lied to you back then
the dream i really had was one
where you got eaten
an8i got angry and blew up
i dont expect any sudden changes
bibbidi bobbidi boo
its like a good luck charm
i still cant wait to go back
that feeling ran off somewhere
ill get more and more impatient
i wanted someone to hold my hand tightly
an8i dont know what warmth is
my hearts become poor
the worlds filled with beauty
dont miss it
come to your senses before the night ends
i want to close my eyes
boring days like these
youll definitely want to overcome them
we cant ever forget that
never ever
before you know it time has passed
i dont expect anything while daydreaming
ill cry in the space between reality
with these feelings that rip up my insides
the words i swallowed sting
all thats left is the absurdity
thrusting that knife
tearing your adams apple
my fingertips are moist
how to use a fork
i dont even try to look at the truth
i measured the weight of life
the center of the bonfire flickers
what did i see
come to your senses before the night ends
i want to close my eyes
boring days like these
youll definitely want to overcome them
until you hear…
never ever
im cant believe im still alive how many years is it now
im getting so dizzy
those heels where are you going with those flattened shoes
dont look at me in contempt
all by myself in this room soaked with cigarette smoke
it hurts this restless center of a flower
its misery the words that want to meet you
waiting for the lonely stars
a young boy knowing he wants to be loved
declare your goodbye until you beg
waiting for the lonely stars
a young boy knowing he wants to be loved
the night becomes faint
waiting for the lonely stars
a young boy knowing he wants to be loved
declare your goodbye until you beg
im cant believe im still alive how many years is it now
but somehow i feel just fine
hey aki yeah
will you
start on one two okay
one two…
when i hear taki play the violin
its comfortable so romantic
but it also sounded lonely
but i would be thinking the same things too
hey aki
are you glad you quit
we can play the violin without being in the orchestra
ill quit too then
what
its more fun if its just the two of us
thanks taki
i cant wait yeah
theres a brave heartbeat cry in this distorted heart shape
this wretched voice
you also sleep with sadness and loneliness
if the moon hides
i can love you until the depths of tonight
so that it doesnt disappear
i want to hold onto the things i cant see
i wasnt wrong that day that saving voice
it was lost in this bloodied story
youre not alone anymore
but if it hurts and is a neverending night
im sure you wont suspect it
im burdened by it all now
well get it back
but whenever i woke up from a dream you were always there
taki i want you back here
start on one two okay
the lights are changing please do not rush to cross
please do not rush to cross
i knew it and lamented over it
i threw away my human shell
i cant get out of this small box
before i knew it i wanted to escape
i just want to be dumb
i cant ever become anybody
thats why im standing on the front lines
waving that flag nice and high
its inferior its a partner you can rely on
any dramatic turn of events will result in a dot heat
you say yes yes take a breath
swear youll see me again
i only got one chance
place our bets on that one moment
my hands sweat like its the climax
standing alone crying out
that truth i hid is nowhere to be found
people who sneered at me have no place
tears that fall have no reason
a hand thats stretched out theres nothing but doubt
a hole opens with love dripping out
you take a peek at me falling down
just breathe all right all right
i cant ever become anybody
were fighting each other now
its overtime surrender now
mayday im slightly fond of you
dripping with words of love and hate
you say yes yes take a breath
the directions are over there headshot thoughts clamor in my mind
shoot out that heart
pull that string you dont see
thanks
yeah on a loop
lately ive been listening to last dance
last dance its a great song
i see
what songs do you like
uh…
really yeah really
so you are listening to it
what else oh heart forecast
theyre all good i cant pick one youre right
listen to all of them
ill listen to last dance
yeah we can dance to it
this city is overgrown with skyscrapers
you cant take everything i want
distorting me
we can laugh at the absurdity
lay on some pretty words wait for it rush for it struggle for it
crash deep into your ego
maybe one day again
youll dance for me like this
tinged with irritation young boys and girls
distracted the yesman patient
nobodys anything
lets talk until our tongues are dry
i put up a front and lost myself
ill be dumb and fly through the air
then i break down
pure and clear young boy
you do it under the spell of your feelings
ill think about it in the corner of the world
and a melancholy patient choose tomorrow
saying goodbye to me who can never return
maybe one day again
taki i finally remember now
oneeyed
oneeyed
dream… oneeyed…
then before i knew it that oneeyed thing got closer
thats so scary it was just staring at me
then i realized it was just a dream
then i…
im laughing at that hoarse voice
binding these thoughts of nobody
drunk and wandering about in nameless and pointless days
just how many words have made you suffer
these feelings are in a jam this discomfort is pretty simple
im the worst existence ever dont overlook anything
raise your voice at the end
i dont care about your talent
what i want is for you to accept me
thats how i was dealt with
thats right theyre all idiots
they cant come back or drop dead
if you just swallow up those thoughts
those expectations and ideals
youre still cursed now
thats why even if you fall at the ends of the world
youll still be alive in my eyes
draw a picture in your mind from now until forever
im laughing at that hoarse voice
binding these thoughts of nobody
i pray the near future will become a bright long and far away future
it doesnt look like i can keep
words are like breathing
im sorry mom and dad
im gonna kill you all
raise your voice at the end
i dont care about your talent
those expectations and ideals
youre still cursed now
thats why even if you fall at the ends of the world
youll still be alive in my eyes
draw a picture in your mind from now until forever
draw a picture in your mind from now until forever
im laughing at that hoarse voice
binding these thoughts of nobody
take us to the deepest parts of the heart
extend your hand out to me
i know now its okay to be here
aki
aki
aki…
one two one two…
one two one two
one two one two…
i jumped off
aki…
and the rest empty humans
expectations made life is unfair
the unusual is a great vehicle with no talents
treating friends and enemies alike lacking individuality
dont cry in between dreams
you know what expression you should have on your face
but keep on doing it
when the curtain of night falls thats the signal
spit out these lies
dont stop yet dont stop yet
run fall hold on to the pain that never disappears
these lyrical feelings shake like a computer bug
punishment for these defects are obedient
veritable pandemonium of puppet vows
the end is linked together
dont throw away your life
you dont know what expression you should have on your face
but keep on doing it
youre at the gloomy depths of the night
fall deep deep inside
do i look so ugly
this is me right now
im a corpse that cant become anybody so laugh at me
i stopped running from everything in front of me
repeating the same images running toward my imagination
when the curtain of night falls thats the signal
spit out these lies
dont stop yet dont stop yet
run fall hold on to the pain that never disappears
…two one two

destined to be a victim

 he wasnt an evil man
misguided
flawed even
when life was simple
except for that last time
and we came upon this horse stuck in a trap
no idea where it came from
its energy was so drained
and it mustve been screaming and screeching out for hours
but when we got there it kinda just lay there
it didnt try and pull away
it just looked up with these weary eyes
 so he just helped it die
i ran
i hated him so much for that
 an irresistible sleep fell deeply on his eyes
the sweetest soundest oblivion
weve been here too long
 you deserved that

this whole mess
she and i are done

 shes killed all of our friends
and shes coming to kill us now
im gonna kill the fucking cunt
how do you want to do this exactly

we set our trap
 we need to wear her down make her slow
the less focused she is the better chance well have
but let me first do some great thing
that shall be told amongst men hereafter
for our friends
 for our friends
 are you looking for me
come in mercy falls cabin
and ill make it quick
not a single birthday came
when i peacefully wished him happy birthday papa
then youll understand how i feel
who had a sexy daughter  a young princess
and this monkey shows up and starts mimicking and teasing her
then the monkey splashes water back at her  and he goes
princess gets upset obviously
papa there is a toxic monkey in the jungle teasing me
he is making such lewd gestures
the king gets furious
go and deal with him
and the monkey says what do you think youre doing dude
whatever the minister did or said
the monkey would repeat it
the minister gets all confused
and starts racking his brain
he summons two swords  one real and one fake
he keeps the fake one for himself
then he took the fake sword
the monkey sees this
grabs the real sword and goes
animals are multicellular organisms
in the biological kingdom animalia
the word animal comes  from the latin animalis

we talked on the phone for a week
and we got engaged today
you know how girls used to choose  their husbands back in the days
back in the days
lets go back in time
centuries ago there were two types of men
alphas were the tough ones
would divide the hunted food among themselves
the women were not only responsible for nourishing the children
thats how communities operated
however their influence extended beyond the kitchen
from the rival hunters  and wild creatures
i mean a bunch of arvinds or an alpha
alpha
exactly
so when all the women started choosing strong men
the weaker ones got jealous
thats when poetry came into the picture
thi cross the seven seas for you
ill get you this ill get you that
but they never really do anything
the only oneswho actually do something are the
alphas
gitanjali
you have a big pelvis
no no im not trying to say you are fat
what i mean to say is you have a big pelvis
thank you guys  thanks for coming
thank you  kartik
yeah
is there any chance that i can get married to gitanjali
what
is there a chance
what are you saying man
forget about that
hey relax and start your engines
why did all of you stop  your bikes huh
 you should leave all this drama started because of your aunt
your aunt must have seen something in gitanjalis eyes for me
which made your aunt tell her to address me as brother
ninth grade
she said yes
she said yes means she said yes
she even invited me to her house
who is he my child
dont you dare laugh
did gitanjali ever call any one of you brother
in school or after school
no  no  never
she calls me brother  when im with them
but uses my name when were alone
bros ive noticed that too
wont your body react
i had a high fever
ask her she must have had it too
and its not like these emotions  have suddenly resurfaced today

balbir singhs son

swastik steel is the only company where a father a son
power progress and victory
now is the time to get back to work for those
who were praying for my fathers recovery
if we can build bridges roads
airports and connect  different countries
then we can definitely  track down our enemies
the same hands that construct skyscrapers
the same hands that shape molten steel
the person who shot balbir singh
no matter where he is hiding
in the sky or underground
whether its the day hiding him  or the night
power progress victory  the third generation entrepreneur
he openly threatened to cut the throat  of the man who attacked his father
bad thoughts physically and mentally damage you  in such a way that the impact can be seen
grandmom

im sure youll like it
took me back 25 years
dont worry
he said a couple of nice things
dont you have any pride
im going with him

he can buy all the security in the world
but paali he isnt here looking  for security and power
right and he thought about his brothers after 20 years huh
dont make me smack you
go and prepare for your exams
theyre just naive kids but you know better
paali personal differences dont matter
the seed were planting today
our future generations will draw examples from it

this is impractical and dangerous
and he wont be going everywhere
you can work from home for a few days
this is not a small deal

making these plans
i cant seek your permission  for everything

you are a strong independent  beautiful woman reet
you should be happy that both your kids take after you
dominant genes

reet you fell for the wrong guy
look at gitanjali
varuns father was a scamster too
doctors said his bodys pumped full of chemicals

you shared your love with a criminal
so what if varun is dead
if hes dead hes dead
disorientated
i dont believe in wearing one

no son
what are you saying
abstain means abstain
you should embrace the concept of mortality
your time on earth is coming  to an end
surpasses all these things
if i continue to live
will you give up your vows of abstinence
write down swamijis address
and inform your wellwishers to visit him
his life is supposed to be coming to an end

he thinks swastik steels logo  is the same as hitlers logo
swastika steels logo is straight

the nazi logo is slanted
wheres manjot
hes offering water to father
your brother he is a sinner
there is no redemption  for what he has done
what are you saying father

my cigarettes
 happy birthday my child  thanks nana
what is going on
whats there to think about amma
look at his state
nana keep the newspaper down
so stuck up on our intercast marriage
and suddenly you have this concern why
we are concerned
he helped me with the childbirths
when they induced labour
i had contractions but the cervix was not opening
i needed so much blood because i lost so much blood
like a nurse
and you know the most important thing is
hi son
you really dont know anything
amma he is like my gynaecologist
he knows me in and out
he is my father mother brother
brother  hmm
we are leaving
whoever wants to go can go  i wont yell at anyone
uncle asked us to go back
papa
papa
papa
did you bring them here
papa you were 66 when you got shot
but i trusted youll be alright  and you became alright
you want to start mourning before im even dead
first thing
dont speak to me in this language ever
you dont value the doctors reports and advice at all
you know your heart can collapse any time now
i would give you my heart  if i could
but it doesnt work like that
papa
the trick is patience
some twelfth graders beat me up in school
you know why
not to the principal not to mom not to you
im waiting again this time
you should wait too
someone will surely die for me
and ill get a new heart  for the transplant
dont we
theres still so much left
no ones going anywhere
hmm
gitanjali
gitanjali
you didnt tell her
use your words i am not deaf
sheela come with me
eat
why
you really thought just because i cant taste
i could sense it from how thick it was
please give
next time youre pissed at me
dont mess with the salt or pepper
just add some poison instead
story over
nothing
no she was definitely saying something
and then when i came  you changed the topic
we were just talking about kartik
i see
its hurting
what nonsense are you saying
dont please
you are excited to get married
dont
and you took a gun there
when i heard that
i thought your firing should never stop
but now im scared when i see you
take me to a place like kashmir and well conquer it all
i cant smell you
where trees speak in fragrant whispers untold
where the clouds dwell too
and he is gaining weight like a pig
love and attention
dont bring up that topic again
dont start it again
i dont believe in regrets
neither does your son
and be lost in your embrace forever
how do i stop myself tell me again
like a fresh waterfall
they might have got a donor
we have a meeting in the evening mark mark mark
ill personally draw my own designs
its my touch
are you ordering for more guns
so i have this local guy freddy
you can get in touch with him  he will coordinate everything
in a marriage there should be some fear
she spoke some real big words
one more thing
a married man should never have a protruding belly
it causes problems
gitanjali
i took six bullet shots
think like you dont have this
now tell me
if someone keeps trying to kill your father what will you do
look at yourself
youre thinking the same  that youd fight back
like men have been fighting  for thousands of years
what are you doing gitanjali
sadly its a mans world
brother
 what  brother
so who do think you are out
you are fighting ghosts in your head
do you even realise that
i dont fight ghosts i devour them
you have gone mad
you have lost your mind
mom papa why are you guys fighting

it takes time to thaw the body
where are we going now
brother you know what asrar was like

my brother is dead

when you murdered his brother
he found out everything about you
the family wont suspect a thing
after that when the time was right
when you wouldve been with me
he wouldve killed your father
and while dying balbir singh wouldve had just one question
kill your wife gitanjali
murder your kids
your grandfather your mother
they would see the face of the man
your face
he wouldnt have to kill you
tell me more
and that explosion was meant to kill you
i knew who you were from day one

a few years later i heard he set himself
on fire and died
when balbir took over swastik
you mean abrar haques father

you take another bite and ill slit your throat
and ill remove that tasty morsel
comprende
go ahead take another bite
see if im playing
now get the hell outta here
 mission accomplished
one that gets overlooked a lot
were a good golfers number one tool
 could a golf cart calculate the yardage on the next pin
could it tell em what club to use on the next shot
could it clean and locate their balls
more than anything else we 
a caddy is a golfers best friend and confidant
 youre kind of a loser around here
 i dont think so
 no i can tell these things
same way a dog can smell when a womans on her period
 is that a thing
i think the guys are pretty cool dudes
 championship caddies
 yeah theres a special ranking system for caddies
you think i didnt know
how could i be the caddy manager
if i dont know this stuff huh
i just thought you wanted to know
 i didnt go to caddy management college
 sorry
 yeah
 you think i didnt go to caddy management college
do you think im lying about that
 i didnt even know such a thing existed
 there is a thing and i went there
 okay
 i did
 okay
hes onto us
no hes not
he knows youre a fake
at any cost
now im gonna spray you with some of this stuff
and nothings gonna happen
you got nothing
that other gopher was just a fluke
my patented fertilizer does not turn you fuzzy
do we have an agreement
my fertilizer does not do the above
i will let you go and well forget all about this
here we go
oh just in case this does turn you
into a mutated killing machine 
but just in case im sorry
and please try to remember my compassion
thank you
youre okay
youre okay
see it wasnt my formula
no wait
dont do that
you got you had me you had me
oh shit youre not kidding
what are you gonna do hambone
who knows how many of these creatures
wait mr landon
hell know what to do
this is unacceptable
you mean to tell me that if these gophers
ingest your formula
 that seems to be the case
my course
 other than this one ive only seen one other
and were sure this thing is dangerous
 one attacked me on the green sir
 im 50 certain
but theres only a 30 chance that thats right
 50 certain
these little flea bags can be
flannager
 yes sir
 that trap right there sir
well is it safe sir
 safe of course its safe
would i lie to you
 oh well there was that one time sir
 and i found a cream to fix it
no harm no foul
 youre right there sir
now stick your hand in there
 sorry sir
its totally my bad sir
 i cant let these gophers ruin my tournament
of the richest mediocre golfers their entry fees
i already spent half of it
this problem has to be solved before it gets out of hand
our mission
is to rally the caddies
and have them round up all these godforsaken things
 should i inform the troops of the entire situation
 hell no
as far as they know
theyre gonna be collecting your average
cute and cuddly funloving run of the mill gophers
deadly force
as far as i care
 as you know i am disciplined
trained and proficient in all of my warrior tasks
 god speed hambone
god speed
 goddammit
 you just gotta relax and keep calm
and your games been preoccupied for the last three holes
 i know i topped the drive
 just stay in the present
back when i actually enjoyed some part of my life
focus on the pieces of the shots
 pieces of my shots
align your body
arm back
all right buddy
and you think the mere presence of a woman
would throw off your precious golf game
so if youre gonna be here
you just have to relax and stay cool
she might even be a good luck charm
shes our new caddy manager
shes been four years at caddy college
she probably knows more about golf than both of us
 caddy college
what in tarnation is caddy college
 you think just because i dont have a stinky wiener
between my legs that i cant know anything about golf
every other day of the week trying to ruin our fun
 cute how we try
how we try
 i do mind
and i bet i could hit one of these ball things
 you think you could hit the drive better than me
 you bet your old wrinkly balls i do
 feisty this one
 psst
becky psst
psst
 look i know this guys an asshole
but hes one of the wealthiest club members
but mr landon wont be pleased if this guy complains
 fuck mr landon
 dammit
 oh whats the matter girly
not as good as you thought you were huh
 youve got this becky
just concentrate on the ball
be one with the ball
 googie
 oh my balls
its okay nice shot
 best out of three
 not again
 do you stan do you
 i havent heard you say that once this whole film
 any of you guys ever hear stanny boy here
 no

you cant party hard stan

and i can party harder than every one of you
 party harder than all of us
you gotta be kidding stan
 you gotta be kidding stan
 your moms tit stan
 leave my mom outta this
shes dead you know
 my condolences stan
 you know thats probably why she laid there

 quiet quiet
weve got pressing matters to discuss
 okay
but make it quick

when this tournaments over im gonna build a wall
youre lucky you dont have any money
then finally me and my friends
will be free of nuisances like you
yeah id like to see you get in here then
nobody gets a drop on wells landon
christ
hey hey hey how you doing
you know that stuff i was saying
you dont think i meant any of it do you
hey we can talk about this we can negotiate it
that im gonna let you join my club
no
 men all this stuff you hear about caddies
to goof off and party hard
is a load of bullocky
caddies love to work
a caddy must be alert at all times
if he expects to keep his job
i got a whole speech to do here
there will be no partying for you boys tonight
we gotta stay late
i worked really hard on it
 forget this i got stuff to do
 be seated
 oh jesus
 listen up you no good bitch wipes
until your mission is complete
there comes a point in every caddys life
sure we might hate our jobs
sure we might go home and look in the mirror
to have just a bit of mercy and end our lives
sure we may go home
only to remember your dog died three years prior
but that is not today
 yeah
 we will return men
one day when youre sitting in your favorite chair
and your grandkids ask you
what the greatest day of your life was
it will be this day
and they will look at you with pride
spewing out of their eyes like diarrhea
like diarrhea
 yeah
 make me proud boys make me proud
 yeah
 proud proud proud proud proud
proud proud proud proud proud
 whats hambones damage man
i know right we should be by the pool

booze

the police have launched an investigation recently
lets with this
fourth master
all right
im here to announce
is over 100 years old
let alone interest
why
because the players were desperate
so from now on
for anyone borrows
fourth master
dont do good deeds
if the players took our money
whatever he bet to which game
well help him place a bet
but it cannot exceed 500 at a time
if he loses
its okay
if he wins
on his winnings
he won 500
we can always get our capital back
instead of killing a man
at the end
are we
we can take the interest
that he wins every time
well take the interest
interest can be collected in time
capital can be picked up slowly
good
good
good
were ready
good
please

fourth master
you bastard
before everyone speculated why zhengyang yan is missing
it turns out that you killed zhengyang yan
now that the evidence is overwhelming
that they would do like this for their own cause
qi yang has been arrested
although qi yang may have confessed
he was only honest about what he did
to put the video in the ceremony
should not be huasen
but killing zhengyang yan
is just for upgrading qi yang instead
mu
is there anything in the disk
other than qi yangs voice
that is suspicious
the recordings are fragmented
only know that huasen group
all anonymous except
qi yang is an idiot
remember that his wife is our leverage
how can you be softhearted
why would i trust qi yang
who like a greedy wolf
is gonna implicate us

where the innocent perish and the vicious thrive
it is natural to succumb to fear
the strong prey upon the weak and vulnerable
looking to carry them away into the darkness
the shadows are an ally of predators that stalk unnoticed
waiting to strike the fatal blow

she had just given birth
because they woulda took her back to her owner

yeah i did
it wasnt creative like your act
 you seemed so comfortable  im an actress

the boss steals peoples clothes
they say she lives upstairs ive never seen her
youre a bit strange
im not a virgin

oh how sweet your very first parlor
show your claws but be careful

im 26 its my last chance
who pay to perform for their friends
focus on your next tryout
what you earned tonight
will allow you to turn down exhausting extra work
that pays dirt
something happened to me
this guy i had kind of dated
the head of a regional theater called me
he asked me to dinner with a director friend of his
i invited a friend thinking it would be fun
but it wasnt at all what i expected
what happened
we had wine
and i just didnt see it coming
but before i knew it i was in the directors lap
where was your friend
she hadnt arrived yet
shes always late
had disappeared
anyway
but i wasnt into it so i asked him to stop
i said no several times
but i clearly said no
and
shit hes really going to do this
i remember telling myself
the guy was ashamed he ran to the bathroom
holding his pants
my friend and i started laughing
she said she saved her friends
he raped you
the theater guy
thats benjamin
say we usher in the same theater okay
hi love
hi honey
 meet aurora the new usher  hi
soso the actors werent very good
you know what i think of theater if youre not in the play

that i wrongly constructed words of innocence
for very shame i cannot bear your sight longer i go
ah cruel prince too well you understood me
i have said enough to save you from mistake
in all her fury
i love
but think not that at the moment when i love you most
you know it by heart youre ready
hi bimbos

dont you want your fries theyre expensive around here
corto maltese
you know i have my private clientele
occasionally
she told him she was going to qatar to be a backup dancer
they confiscate passports in qatar
thats why we have no news shes locked up somewhere in the desert
i bet she married a prince
youre so negative
id like to suggest something thats forbidden
06
85
this wine is lovely
lots of new tastes in my mouth
thats the banks of the rhône
ill show you my cellar if you like
thank you
i love your voice
its so soft
thank you
i love everything about you
and i immediately felt a bond
am i wrong
no youre right
shes with an interminable but very wealthy client
listen to yourself you sound like a hooker
were dancers not hookers
its weird that the money turns you on
im honest about my desire
so tell me
well
but it was so obvious and natural
i was totally wet before we even started
i was more comfortable with him than most of the guys ive slept with
did he take off his glasses
not even
maybe it was the heat of the moment
it was quite touching
and youre proud of yourself too
im done
hi there
the great discounts and you walk in
with a special delivery something like that
no idea well think about it
i do my thing
you come from over there
now its my turn
hello im filling in for my husband who couldnt deliver today
i brought lots of seasonal fruit
i have strawberries
apples
i have
oh hi
want to help us out with the staging
thanks but i have to go change
you think she saw us
right
thanks
i cant stay
im sorry im
im no picnic
youre a beautiful picnic
on the contrary it gives me confidence
i feel alive for the first time in ages
yes i do
want a little dance
i see
how do you rent here if your parents arent loaded
dont rent in paris im in bobigny
i cant afford to buy
its not so expensive these days
i can make you pay slips agencies and landlords love them
thats fabulous
lets go
i have a new boyfriend
really
guess what hes a cop
i was leaving the club
he took back the ticket and asked for my number
its too early in the day
youre a goddess
i listed all my services
we could create a shared profile if youd like
this is an individual profile
i really think it could work
who just want to spice up their lives
it could be really cool take a look
working in pairs limits the risks
when i started having sex
i couldnt believe
for nothing
youre jealous
youre jealous im doing it with elody instead of you
its not safe like here
 statistically its risky  statistics can be manipulated
if they surveyed female lawyers and bakers
wed learn that they too get assaulted
promised
im done lets leave together
youre the jealous one
room 712 its 6 pm were on our way
the client pays first
ill count it discreetly you never know
 itll be fine  i wonder what he looks like
who knows

seventh floor
you did it this man is amazing
my goodness
my gorgeous girls
cant you sleep over
i cant
benjamins coming home tonight
i feel like i found the magic formula
im totally at peace

thats because youre in love with me
maybe
what
am i getting carried away
what gets me going
i love your real name
manon
tell me a secret
you first
i dont like talking about it because
i dropped out
im sure you know how it works
then you find yourself a dissertation adviser
mine was a professor id studied with
i met him during my masters
he was a fascinating guy regularly published
the perfect adviser
he always took me out to dinner i loved it
its silly but those meals
then without saying a word to me
he left his wife and kids
to live with me
you wicked temptress
its not funny
i told him i hadnt asked for anything
i didnt want to commit love just wasnt my thing
and he went crazy
obviously we couldnt keep working together
youre not allowed to change
now you know my secret
your turn
i have a child
you do
shes seven
shes incredible
a child complicates everything especially when youre young
when i started taking private lessons
i thought he was really cute
he was a physics student
benjamin
with him everything was easier
we were very much in love and we became organized
i only see her every other week so i want to make the most of it
whats her name
eve
see her in the yellow jacket
she didnt see us
since i started stripping ive been getting these visions
want to hear about them
or because she hit a nerve
yes maybe well no it does scare me
and with the kids too
even if im not around
i try to call every night when im away
i think she sent you a call for help or a warning
show her you heard it you dont have to change everything
you could say thinking of you
ive missed you its been a long week
women love that
you like the car i rented for you
shall we try
like this
i know why you shop with us

hello
go ahead
to the homes where she worked as a maid
while she worked we stayed in the kitchen
praise or scold her
one day her boss said
im very disappointed
you cant be trusted
for that tone of voice
for this world where humiliating others comes so easy
why have i never written about social domination
whose backgrounds were so different from mine
i would more or less lie to them about my origins
with others
i was deeply embarrassed to admit my origins
bravo
if im selected
youre my goodluck charm
bravo
thanks im so hungry
so if you get in
will you quit the club
whats the problem
im worried about your career it could cause problems
its not like i make porn flicks
true
but think about it
right
bad news were out of wine
ill open it
on particles i study flavors
fabulous i love to eat
do you work with molecular gastronomy
not really flavor in terms of physics

platonov by chekhov

some thought she was dead clients asked for her

a star is born
a new face lights up the red carpet
did you meet someone
someone yes

tino
tino
tino
how did you know im here
i saw your post online
i also asked around
i understand why youre furious
then good
because im not going with you
 tino  tino
tino
im not asking you to come home
you should patch things up
shes been drinking again
i was there when you left us to be with a man
i was there when she was heartbroken
i was there id pick her up in random bars because she was so drunk and wasted
id clean her up
i know
then why did you abandon me
believe it or not i love your mom
get out of my life
please
thats what you get from running away
i wont deny it
im no saint
but i never ran away
dont compare me with you i was honest with my exwife
i wasnt running away from anyone
i came here to live life as i want to
 but you also hurt other people right  but im not an asshole like you
fuck okay fine im an asshole
yes youre an asshole so enough with your excuses
you talk like youre not at fault
so its her fault now
why am i wrong
do you think i chose to be an asshole
she was only thinking of herself
its all about her and her own fucking happiness
when my mother left us
i only cried once
damn it was hard
the first few months was hard
until she moved on
and i moved on too
we were okay
we were happy
are you okay
yeah
you can talk to me about it
im fine just cuddle me
im sorry its quite messy
thank you
lets just wait for tino
hes out for a surfing lesson
let him be
the more you stop him the more hell resist
i just want to make sure that hes okay
its good that i met you
the truth is
thats normal
her mommy hazel once told me that santino is allergic to relationships
thats why i was surprised when i met you
its probably our fault
maybe were not good role models for him
maybe thats also the reason why his first boyfriend cheated on him
first boyfriend
yes
when he was a teenager he dated a much older guy
it happened while hazel and i were preoccupied with our own problems
and when we found out it was too late
tino was traumatized
and i understand why he is indifferent towards me
its fine im just reviewing for an exam
yes
i really hope so
i think thats stress
when i was in college i cope through meditation
im tired of all your excuses
what
im trying my best here to be on your side
you have a choice
and you choose not to forgive
it was your choice to be an asshole
tino
tino
what
are you mad at me
what do you think
i told you i dont want to talk about them
but you even cozied up to my mother
tino she was just helping me out
i dont know what youre going through
because youre not telling me
i hate this
all this drama
not too hard but not too soft
am i doing it right
yeah
okay now
joaquin what the hell
 what  whats wrong with you
im sorry
can we focus please
no
forget it lets just fuck
i am only going to do it with you when were with tino
okay
because
because
i thought this is consented cheating
what no ones cheating here
no one
you know
i tried to seduce chan
but you
you have a chance
he cares a lot about you
on what really matters to you
should we call joaquin
does he really have to be here when were having sex
i thought youre enjoying it
why dont we let him decide for our relationship
chan
chan please i dont want to argue
please lets not fight
i dont want to make a big deal out of this
fuck this is why i hate relationships theres too much drama
this is not just drama
i love you and i will never hurt you

do you think youre doing me a favor
you know nothing about my past
 i said  shut up
shut up
tino
good thing i found you here
what happened
can we talk this time
what are you doing here anyway
but i promised your mom that i will fix this
dont you think its too late for that
i was so thankful when you and mom broke up
i thought i was the only reason why you stayed together
whatever your mom and i went through
yes
thats why you left me
because your boyfriend didnt want me in your life
you abandoned me
 because your mama needed you  i needed you
im sorry
but son im here now

mastectomy
removal of breast

saras medicines
and welcome back this is rj mike
we were talking about travels
its all about the journey not about the destination
only when we are lost in our travels do we explore new ways
in our life there may have been
some unforgettable
or some travels that have created an impact
so
lets hear each other out
is 7356044484
so lets meet up again tomorrow morning
this is rj mike signing off this is your own music monk
hey anto
mike
someone has come to see you
mastectomy
see this is a like a metamorphosis
after gender affirmation surgery
it is important that you shouldnt feel incomplete
after the transition your confidence should increase
then he can undergo physical transition
the reasons you are saying now to transform into a man
arent silly in my opinion
i can figure out social reasons in it
thats why you desired to transform into a man
you should strive to achieve them by continuing as a woman
that should be your motive sara
dont you think you should strive to achieve it
you took away the name i had reserved for myself
mike
huh huh
there is a cafeteria close by
where were you all this while
amsterdam
but i never expected you at all
where is everyone

little kunjali wants to sleep

mangattachan
yes thats it
as long as he is leading the zamorins army
dont take things lightly your highness
we need help from the portuguese
if you dont want to lose your crown and sceptre

if you dont want to see zamorins nairs plundering the kochi palace
m
his highness sent this for you
what do they want
kartaas

kunjali
come here
ask for his forgiveness
hes a child right
just forgive him
he did it unknowingly
mama
mama  careful kunja
dont hit your forehead on the door
its bad omen
when the zamorin said that they cant enter calicut
the portuguese came with a huge navy
and waged war at ponnani beach
as zamorins left hand there was mangattachan at the coast
and as his right hand i was at the sea
along with my son kuttypokkar ali
we fought for 3 days continuously day and night
the portuguese navy was burned down
so many people died
here
even if he gets married
though we won the war
including your father
after burying him
and surrendered his sword before the zamorin and bowed to him
the same night
and walked south with him
thats how we reached here
not a single ship will reach your harbour now
the traders are all standing united with kuttyali marakkar
hey well
i know what to do
what is it
the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes
the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes
the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes
you have become the guiding light of my life

the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes
we shall make our dreams come true my companion

it was my duty to ensure the welfare of the people
now this land is ruled by the zamorin king
our mosque has rice and groceries only for a couple more days
the storms took away the boats and huts of the fishermen
wipe off all that blood and get a plate from somewhere
you can take this plate

rice to eat and clothes to wear
and money to rebuild houses and repair the boats
have been sent here by his highness zamorin

the authority to distribute it by verifying names and houses
the bullock carts can go directly to namath house

move away
let me check move away
allah
get up and move
this forest is our province hereafter
how long can we hide in the forest like this bhaijaan
ill tell you a story
listen
to fight thousands of enemies
the prophet marched to medina with just 313 soldiers
as an answer to the prophet
above the palm trees
after counting them
nabi told the soldiers
only 14 people would be martyred among us righteous people
that was the answer that god gave nabi
during twilight
above the palm trees
i also saw many stars shining bright
those are you children
those who see the tears of people who are in misery
god will never give up on such people
come everyone
look at that
what is this
rice  grains at kappad beach
from kunjali take it
aimootty
didnt i ask you to go visit your wife and son
let it be time brother
its not like that aimootty
but if something happens to you
to cry and suffer
whatever troubles you may face im there for you
a ship is coming
its a portuguese ship
i had seen the flag
since its really foggy i couldnt see clearly
faster
mama
go do your work
no helping
enemy on board
thangudu
mama
hey drop your sword
otherwise ill slit her throat
mama
partner where are you
aimootty
brother
brother
brother
how did this happen
is really painful
you should go and give this money to your sisterinlaw
convince her that he died in an accident or something
bravo
slitting the opponents throat without shedding even a drop of blood
his younger brother achyuth aint bad either
let the practice continue
say it softly he has the ear of an elephant
during the harvest in last january
that rascal kunjali stole 800 barrels of grains i brought from my warehouse
he stole the goods you were about to sell the arabs for exorbitant prices
to the left to the left jump and attack
you dont know anything mangattachan
that viceroy is really agitated
kolathiri was bigger than zamorins kozhikode once
dont forget that
puthumana that was before your father koloth panicker
after losing the battle to mangattachan
the vigour and valiance of the kolathiri army has never diminished
please dont mind this master
father and uncles keep boasting about themselves wherever they go
to discuss what has to be done to safeguard the country when it is facing a threat
confine your talks to that topic
this is a scheme by the portuguese to infiltrate the zamorin kingdom
once the army enters the country
and that rascal stole that entire box of money
ive never heard about kunjali stealing even a penny
from anyone who behaves decently to other people
it can be a penny it can be millions
if you cant capture him  slit his throat
i will capture kunjali and bring him to you
will anyone tell me
who is this kunjali
those who have seen him are not alive
fold their hands and bow to him
this ananth will tie up kunjali and bring him in front of you
they wont allow even the gods to enter there and touch him
well  no your highness
i will bring him here before this lunar month is over
dead or alive
no one needs to know how
this is achyuth mangattachans word
the landlords can open their mouths after that
and offer your prayers there
partner whats the name of this flatnose
chang yui yang  what what
that name wont come out of my mouth
let us give him a name
chinali
chinali or thenali
he wont understand all that
mama mother
mama
i understood  what
ask him to eat first
hey chinali
mama
hey
come on
oh my god
bloody monkey
hes kicking like crazy
he kicks really hard
move
let it be
mama
your mama
dont play in that water youll catch some disease
mama
mama
my son where were you all this while
sisterinlaw
do you understand anything that these chinese people are saying
ive brought their clothes and some money in this
you tell her sisterinlaw
let them do what they want
i need to stop this business
build a beautiful house and surroundings
and then take you and abdu there
dont you need lots of money for that moin kutty
that has been arranged
just listen to what i say
your bag
kunja
did you see kunjali
no
then who sent this with you
and gave this to me
salutations from kunjali for the honourable his highness zamorin
are not being served justice from their king
this kunjali buckled up my belt and set forth to do that
the day the struggling society of this country
does not befit your stature
also please tell mangattachan that winning through betrayal
if you feel that these words of mine reek of arrogance
please forgive this kunjali
from mammali alias kunjali
shameless fellow
i dont think how it should be done
victory obtained through betrayal is not part of kshatriya clans ethics
is a coward
not a braveheart
you and ananth are equal to me
but im a father whos proud about ananth
i expect to feel the same about you too
he might be a thief and a pirate
there is something that is disturbing my mind
what is it father
a great warrior like kunjali
you are archa right
i alphonso de noronha
captain and commander of the portuguese navy
im here obeying the orders of the honourable viceroy francesco da gama
to personally bring you this scroll your highness zamorin
give me the message from viceroy
ships accompanied by 60 cannons
and around 6000 navy men
will burn down the zamorins empire from kozhikode to kolathiri together
we will chop off zamorins head and hang it below the portuguese flag
before the upcoming full moon day
if you dont agree to our conditions
get ready for war
from viceroy gama
such cruelty
we neednt make any compromise with these cultureless devils
viceroy has decided to defeat us by humiliating and threatening us
whatever happens we wouldnt yield to that
if things happen as described in the scroll
will not be able to survive against the portuguese ships
we should remember that fact
im not taking a hasty decision now
even before the portuguese army sets foot on our coast
the cannon balls that they shoot from the ships of their navy
are you listening to me father
we wont be able to win this war father
he has a point
father
i have an idea in my mind
what is it
be it on land or at sea
yes
so
kunjali
zamorins didnt rule this country for generations
it is only because of the power that the people respectfully bestowed upon us
because of our legacy
was the selfless devotion of many mangattachans
in war strategies
thats exactly why
i am accepting mangattachans suggestion regarding kunjali
the zamorin palace doesnt need any association with the portuguese
your highness
its an army thats 100 times stronger
yet we fought bravely without losing courage
pokkerali died on kuttyali marakkars lap
when i think about hoisting the zamorin flag along with pattu marakkar that day
i still feel proud
this royal court will lose its honour
this land is like our mother
if someone is ready to come forward to save our mother
however bad he may be
we can call him a great man
the zamorin empire had seen him only as an enemy until now
but if we call him as a friend
he will come
go to sleep boy
he will come
kunjali will come
how can you be sure about that
kunjali will come wait and watch
whats happening there
this is not kunjali
how do you know that
he is a shield for his friends
he lives the lives of many others
thank you for this honour bestowed upon me
kunjali
kunjali who might be present as smoke or wind hidden in plain sight
so it was you
before seeing you in person
but
about a kunjali who chops ten heads with a single slash of the sword
to scare them and put them to sleep
so are the people with me
since you have given me respect
i have heard a lot about this palace
we have seen each other somewhere earlier
pattu
pattu marakkar
yes indeed
holding your hand and fighting by your side
long back at the ponnani coast
my dear friend pattu
for around 50 years
need not have that fear anymore
exchange his position
the honour that i was invited here to receive
should be respectfully placed in my hand
i am ananth mangattachan
commander of the infantry
i honour kunjali marakkar with the position of the commander of our navy
thats him
i had felt back then itself
i have to inform something to everyone
kolathiri army wont take part in this war under kunjali
this is beneath our dignity
when rulers of local provinces became part of this empire
after losing to zamorin and bowing down to him
that their soldiers will accompany and serve the zamorin army
dont you remember your father signing it puthumana
then go ahead and chop it lets see
come on
chandroth chop his head off
when someone is insulting our entire family
no one has taught me such a philosophy
in whatever my parents and teachers have taught me
is selfishness your highness
fighting on a warfield is not like hiding and stealing things
not just this kunjali
even if all his dead ancestors come together
we cannot win this war against the portuguese army
the portuguese army will not set foot on zamorins land
first they will come posing as traders
then they will build churches and warehouses
not just the land and the women of this country
that would be our fate
whoever is coming with me can follow me
we will do that job
go and die
how will you stop them
are you asking us to fight them with the few sticks and swords we have
oh god
thangudu
we will win this war
there is something there
give me your rifle
señor
sailing away
doesnt look like trouble
light the fire arrows
attack
all cannons ready to fire
sabeera raja to the left
samudra raja to the right
first and second sails down
open up the stern sails
all the sailors
to the right
stern sail to the right
oars on the starboard
to the left
fire the cannons
come on start
fire the cannons
to see you in person
many years back
listening to the cries of my mother whose throat you slit tying her on to a pillar
among the corpses i killed
destiny brought us face to face
only today
i will introduce you to some noblemen please come
this is abubacker haji from thanoor
arent you abu who used to sell coir at lal mandi
thats not me
hey just because you defeated the portuguese by fluke somehow
then ill throw you before them
are you mocking me
if we had lost this war
achu
father and i are proud about that fact
o dear lord krishna
o lord govinda who plays the flute
we are your people you are our creator
o lord gopala murari
o dear lord krishna
o lord govinda who plays the flute
we are your people you are our creator
o lord gopala murari
where is ananth
you forgot someone your highness
whom
chandroth panicker
its true
please come
your highness
for you
a special reward from me
your highness
granted
what are you thinking about krishna
for your happiness
come to me like the beautiful spring season
as the drops of the drizzling rain fall upon me
i am not myself i am lost somewhere my beloved
my mind is swinging in the sky
come to me like the beautiful spring season
where have you trapped me performing magic tricks on me
throwing glances at me youve captured me in your heart
ive never batted an eyelid ever since i saw you
oh dear god how did you create such beauty
i want to reside in your heart
i have become yours this relationship is called love
as the drops of the drizzling rain fall upon me
i am not myself i am lost somewhere my beloved
i am a honey bee in pursuit
the colours of the rainbow has come into our lives
our lives will be abundant with happiness
we shall live together forever like the union of melody and rhythm
come to me like the beautiful spring season
father
father
father
i think we dont have to think any further
thats right father
without bothering about the superiority of the clan
only when he had this desire
you shouldnt break it father
hold it
hold it
i will fulfill it
smile
smile i say
kunja
what is it
i saw a shadow
oh that
come ill show you
partner
standing guard for you until sunrise
when he talks about you he talks with pride
believe me
how do you know that
i am saying what i understood from his halfurdu halfchinese languages
whenever i close my eyes
you carry on
thangudu
that shadow i saw was not chinalis
long live the king
long live kunjali
we are fixing achus marriage
whos the girl
dharmoth panickers daughter archa
may god bless them
kunjali will let people out of the dining area
i forgot to say something
managattachan you should go to kolathiri urgently
i heard rumors that they are engaged in some secret agreements with the portuguese
o goddess
after the sunrise there is an auspicious hour
that will be suitable
if the zamorin falls
all i expect is an exclusive trade
in the present circumstance none of this is possible
we must wait until the situation turns favourable for us
this is a gift
but you can surely kill
k
uncle
youre lying
no
kha
listen
if you dont mind
who
dont act like you dont know
kunjali
panicker
go and search everywhere
stop
cross this if you dare
none of you will return alive
we wont allow anyone to barge into houses with women  children in them
once we find him
wait  watch
they both are in my house
after getting married
they both havent even changed the dry flower garlands on their necks
call him
wait
kunjali
what has that devil done uncle
kunjali
partner no
almighty
this pregnancy story
let mangattachan come back
your highness
ananth
and make him understand things
what do you think
okay
go
by mere words
i have never been dishonest to anyone till date
i know
not a drop of blood should be shed anywhere
i am begging you
give me permission
go ahead
im sorry
my heart still trembles
the ones who forgive and embrace those who admit their folly
are called humans
uncle
achu
how dare you touch my wife you scoundrel
you should listen to me
you chinese scoundrel
no one will move without my permission
uncle
achu
brother
she is my wife
i will kill that dog who humiliated my wife
kunjali
ananth
no
listen to me
traitor
archa
god
to those who cant respect words
kunjali
partner no
stop it
move away
they should rot
hey who are you
what are you doing here
i am a father
who is begging with folded hands before the person who killed my own son
i need my son
i know everything that happened there
i am a kshatriya brahmin
but for me
that there should be mutual respect even between enemies
i knew your father pokkarali
he was a braveheart
he was fortunate enough to depart without seeing his own sons death
this sinner isnt that fortunate
from the day he was born till today
even though he failed in front of you
if his soul that has departed his body needs to attain salvation
to cremate him performing the last rites
otherwise
you will receive the curse of this old brahmin man
this is ananths promise
no
traitor
listen to me
im saying the truth
couldnt you tell me uncle
as if i didnt
you attacked him like a mad animal
one day
take him
i shouldnt have sent ananth there
kunjali shall be punished for this
without realizing the truth and rectitude
the greatest weight that a man can carry
his own childs corpse
i carried that
i cannot do anything anymore
i am bidding farewell
mangattachan
my dignity pride nobility and arrogance
wait
listen
mangattachan
your highness
your highness
your highness
come closer
we must put an end to kunjalis arrogance
a trial should be conducted
how dare you come here with such a letter
theyve declared you as a traitor
what else should he do
sir
and made the face of kuthiravattom nair who took the elephant
do you still wish to hold kunjali in such high regard your highness
if you are still adamant about it
you had considered mangattachans words to be holy until now right
since he is as good as dead
you must listen to us also now
considering the welfare of the country
you should step down and take rest
you have ruled enough
until you breathe your last
is this a decision made by everyone  yes
if you obey
you will always have this position and respect
thats all we have to say as of now
go
o goddess
i andre furtado de mendonca
im here to hand over this token of honour
from the viceroy francisco da gama
not just that
for the portuguese to build churches and warehouses here
what is this
son
by betraying the people
its not for war
this compromise is for peace
come
for his arrogance towards the royal law
this is also to inform that
achyuth mangattachan has been appointed
third battalion to tents 10 to 15
francisco da gama
i have come with an army of 6000 men
cavalry and artillery
to stop the atrocities
of kunjali marakkar forever
i want his face
at my feet
dead or alive
continue
we will attack him with the combined forces
of the portuguese and zamorin armies
till the fort falls
instead
achu and dharmoth panicker had mentioned this to me
its dangerous to let kunjali grow any further
this should be nipped in the bud
i am ready to stand with zamorin and the portuguese army
kolathiri army is not ready
kolathiri army is not ready to wag our tails listening to the portuguese
come
isnt chandru the commander of kolathiri army
as far as the army is concerned his word is final
take it
take this
before coming here chandroth
yes
if you agree
kolathiri army will join you kunjali
the portuguese army will take away all the crops
they wont spare even a seed to sow
before the people who came to loot this country in the name of trade
in front of the portuguese and zamorin armies who come with guns and swords
you can live happily
you can live
seeing your daughters cleaning up their houses
and when your blueeyed grandchildren born to the portuguese
call you grandfather in portuguese language
and then one day
you will fall dead somewhere
grabbing everything that you get
come with me
i will come
i will come
we are with you
we are with you
we will come
we are with you
kunja
uncle
yesterday during the night
all the shining stars had disappeared
the zamorin and portuguese armies have begun setting up camp outside
after this battle
i am talking about the truth that the prophet saw
leaving me behind on this earth
then until i die
i trust you
thats why im showing you this path
look at my army
all you have is a stream
ill give you one last chance to surrender
and give up your fort
your men will live
if you refuse
and the consequences will be dire
whats he saying
if you step inside the fort
you shouldnt go wrong
whats he saying
whats he saying
he says
whats he saying
zamorin infantry
zamorin
second battalion
full attack
pull it
pull it
artillery
our army is amongst them
our army is here
let those pigs die
we need to face them strongly
remember
the enemy shouldnt reach this side
fire
charge
everyone go inside
cavalry
artillery
come
be careful come
you are the chaff who was born to mangattachan
i killed the one who deserved to do it unknowingly
as a penance for that mistake
get lost
kunjali is dead
kunjali
kunjali
kunjali
kunjali
you traitor
you still have time to kill me
before anyone comes to know
partner
partner
welcome everyone
the crowd seems to be diminishing as time goes by
every day
instead we should kill ten of his men who are in our gallows every day
shoot them dead
i am not ready to stain the royal legacy
to take vengeance against kunjali
yes
the king is always right
would you
or you
or you
for our country
his order
but theres always someone above
the king
the almighty
the god
here i am god
and ive decided
the hundreds of prisoners of war who supported kunjali
have been sentenced to death by the judiciary
guns in position
fire
drop the guns
its time
ive been expecting this arrival for many days
they were exploiting it
for that crime
i shall release the viceroy
but i will only meet his highness zamorin himself
chandroth will come and take you
you should repeat whatever i said to his highness
no one should be brought along
i know whatever youre doing is not right
yet im committing this betrayal
i decided to do this
mother
uncle is here
my mother prayed to the almighty to protect me and gave this to me
it will protect him hereafter
zubaida
though unknowingly
listen
dont go
listen
stop dont go
your highness
people are always victims of circumstances
you me and everyone else
you shouldnt think that you dont have anyone
one word from your heart
that kunjali should be with you
i will chase those portuguese rats away from this country
no
kunjali
the sentence for a capital event
but if marakkar pleads guilty of his accusations
the punishment may be diluted
i hereby sentence
kunjali marakkar to death
by guillotine the french way
my lord
one last chance
beg for mercy
to the king of portugal
and save yourself from death
say it
say it
say it
say it
say it
so the king can hear it with his ears
say it
end him
make him face the blade
let him see his death coming
almighty
save my country
tell these awakened eyes where you are
make the cool breeze a lullaby
teach him to sleep like you

claudia
what is happening flavio
flavio
flavio stop for a moment
hey wait
wait damn it
look the boat is gone
flavio what happened
and sabotaged the desalination plant
and now
we are adrift
no food and no water
everyone was passed out
just drinks and some weed
federico
what was in those joints
herb the usual marijuana
still i didnt smoke and he didnt drink
the only logical explanation is that we were drugged
the strange thing is i understand stealing from us
youre right its weird
things like that dont happen in this area
i think its something political
maybe its a prank on me
enough of this nonsense
stay calm
we have to prepare ourselves for when another boat passes
shit
 a radio that no one has seen before  answer exchange
wasnt the radio broken
this is broken wave
shall i speak to the commander exchange
affirmative exchange
i understand it happens
nobody is kidding we were robbed
weve been adrift for a day exchange
its off the trade routes there are dangerous currents
how soon can it reach us
and take us to the nearest port
maybe its like this in your perfect sailors manual
how do you know my name
elena caetani claudia argan
federico colonna martina zaccone
and especially you enrico cerci
claudia do you want to add me on social media
always looking for followers
may i know who we are talking to
you can call me emilio
emilio as the black corsair by salgari
okay emilio what the fuck do you want
i wanted to know how they were
they must be feeling tired confused
some may be experiencing drug withdrawal effects
like i said youre off the beaten track
then no one will come to the rescue
and your families wont send anyone to look for you
to let you know that everything is ok
and that the holidays are great
a person can go days without eating then no
at least not yet
oh flavio
hello
an experienced sailor
i didnt think he was so naive
as you can see im not naive
i think i deserve a little more of your attention what do you say
okay emilio were listening
i want to talk to enrico
i am here im enrico exchange
just six numbers
the current account password and transfer code
im not talking about the account where you keep your change
you know
im talking about the other account the luxembourg one
where they are currently deposited
chat better with your friends
the walkietalkie battery should last another 48 hours
we pay even more let me call my dad
what is this about luxembourg
in fact i dont think its his
its ours but we thought it was lost
he screwed you
i said we shouldnt trust him
but you didnt listen to me he looked like a swindler
on the other hand
the best way for a thief to hide
its pretending it was stolen
in some mafioso back home from his father
but the guy isnt a jerk like you two
but hes just mad at enrico
he had to pay for the scam and got us involved
its not possible shes right
it has nothing to do with kenya
dont come with this class struggle nonsense
you are a thief
listen federico i messed up there in kenya i agree
right but first dont you dare call me a thief
second
how many times
are you silent now is everyone quiet
just to clear your shitty conscience

and we just wanted to defend our friend
what else are friends for
emilio

a boat could appear at any moment

here stupid you can stay
stay calm i am here
mommy
 good evening sir  goodnight
we saw a morse code sos coming from here
we came to check
you did well
but it is no longer necessary
we received the report
and the rescue operation was immediately activated
 lets take care of everything  is really everthing fine
because that doesnt seem to be standard procedure
even though its against the rules
and finally
they were retired a long time ago
everything is under control my lord
stop wasting my time
do not move
emilio dont do that dont do that
pare
no
no dont do that
are you listening
emilio
im sorry stupid i had no choice
martina you are two murderers
victims
hey you kid
men
men
shit
hi donkey
thats it leave the bag there
take off the coat
look look take it
ready now sit there
make yourself comfortable
did you bring everything
pronto
he finished i took everything
thats what the very rich do
you were the other kid in the car with her
were not alike are we
emilio and martina
from your parents
what difference does
what if i was
you are crazy
any psychiatrist would agree
but believe me
with everything weve been through it would be strange otherwise
we were the happiest children in the world
the happiest
and then suddenly
where we saw our parents agonize and die
dont cry little one
everything is fine
it was an endless hour
even though the or said that help arrived in 7 minutes
go get help sailor
socorro
socorro
socorro
since we had no relatives we ended up in an orphanage
but i guarantee it looked like something from a dickens book
we were finally adopted
a certain tendency towards sadism
this is how psychopaths come into the world
we wanted to destroy your perfect world
it was our fathers fault
because i wasnt wearing glasses that day
and from the polices conclusions
considered inadmissible due to formal defects
who said the ambulance only arrived an hour later
with flavios father defending you
i wasnt even there that night martina
only members and close relatives could enter
i was not there
i was just their kids poor friend
i lived 15 minutes down the road
nobody had been there yet
after drinking so much
he would never get out of jail
all his fathers money wouldnt save him
its just that i
i am teetotal
i never drink
what is more
it was guaranteed
i stayed there
it was simple
and i accepted
martina forgive me
but i didnt kill your parents
well now we kill them both
you told him everything asshole
do you know what i always liked about your films federico
what do my films have
the villain always wins
 and  ask yourself a question
we are saved
what is happening
emilio
im leaving
you understood
no no no
you are ready
good days
but i didnt
im not doing this for you
go home
mummy
i know
understand get lost
who are you guys
uncle i am rinku

and this is
get to the point bro

tiffin
i simply picked up what had fallen on the ground
aunty
the pretty and innocent girl whod got our stuff out
i told her myself
how did she get our address

where
a new world awaits once you conquer your fears
and what are you gonna do when one of those psychos finds us
hey the deaf girls trying to say something
look we need to pick a direction and stick to it
are you crazy what about the bear traps
but just try to stay on the path
 that could work  what about the psychos
what about them we just took one out
we still dont know what the red means
for all we know were going further into the maze
its okay were gonna get out of this maze
and two of us have already been killed
i think were right here and im thinking
hanging around didnt help save them
which means theyre heading in the same direction
if they figure out were behind them
theyll just turn around and chase us down
do you really wanna leave them here awake
and its still not enough
of course we told them
beyond that were out of business
was that on purpose

vast spaces under the blue skies
look as beautiful as you
listen my dear
ive planted a seed
listen my dear
ive come to know
your name blossoms and warms me like a flame
im the interpreter about the lesson
oh hi
oh right
sorry didnt know
tell them they can put their stuff here
did i
need help with anything
not really
ive been thinking
lets just go somewhere
like now
 into what  well
you mean dancing
you know what they say
who says that
math is easy
good
why so chirpy
nothing just a good mood
it is funny
i mean i just had this
nothing cute about it
thats for pops
sure did you see him look at her
youre so observant
dont know it felt kinda stupid afterwards
well i like it
what
whatever that means
im not sure its relevant but the day before yesterday
serious
fuck
what did you learn there
im not very cultivated
so whens the big day
some time in july
im interpreting those classes
you thought it was mine
thats how it sounded
im headed across the square
and im going up
you know what
i made a ridiculous amount of soup yesterday
my brothers deaf
im not very quick
break through
so i just started learning it with him
ended up an interpreter
so essentially you were just lazy to study something else
im just a big lazy bum
you live here by yourself
so what does one wall say to the other wall
careful now
what im doing great
you know whats weird
is it good or bad
its good
its not clear though
absolutely nothing
there was no transition
so what does it mean
dont know
maybe you just dont like me
i do like you
its why i wanted to tell you
do i look good
about what ive told you
you know
a relationship for example
that came out stupid
but it didnt sound stupid
its not like im physically incapable of something
not gross i just dont
i simply dont need it
i googled it
i bet
ok thanks guys
elena youre ok
but dont worry about me ok
just find a place for yourself and try to stay in the moment
well go to mcdonalds to calm me down
if you cry youll disgrace yourself
sure to meet her
how old are you there

why what does he want
he texts whats up at 1am what do you think he wants
wait so if you write whats up it means you want sex
not necessarily it depends on
who you write to and when
do you miss it
what
that lifestyle
you mean promiscuous
come on im really curious
well maybe
that look when
you know someones truly into you
and the energy
it can be so powerful
i cant apologize every time
i know
im ok
doesnt it hurt
you can go harder
how can you always be so sure about everything
i remember when you told me
we were by the river drinking wine
even when you were with donatas
my god viktorija
seriously though
dont you miss guys
the attention
love
my mother kept asking this for a long time
isnt it hard to have no family
no children no flat
you know whats the worst part
i actually
hardly ever think about it
i never feel lonely
i just want to know
im just saying
youre drunk
neither do i
open relationship
damn it who set the rules for everyone to live by
dovydas
you know i
like what
but this life doesnt suit everybody
of course not
if you slept with other guys
would that make me less of a man
who invented this whole system
you feel sick
can you unhook it
to keep your head from spinning
do you ever feel like
like what
like
theres something wrong with you
were you jerking off
well yeah
seriously
i dont see it as a particularly
sexual act
but that involves thinking about someone
youre not thinking at all
what are you a buddhist
 not necessarily  yes necessarily
no its about physiology thats all
whats the difference
you could fucking try at least
ok im sorry im not normal enough for you
i didnt say you werent normal enough
fine go live your life

brahmam sir
leave that glass aside for some time and listen to me

the media will at least gain trps what would i gain
idiot

brahmam this is why when arjuna was in confusion lord sri krishna told
master i beg you dont start with your bhagavad geetha sermons
you dumbo
if you try to disobey me
with your lie exposed the public would chase you like mad dogs
dumb idiot
praise our saviour brahmam
great soul great soul
yes theres a way
what is the solution
village loot
we shall anoint it with panchamrit
and then offer it to mother ganga
bring it down
what a sacred opportunity
you petty human
you bugger
in a huge war with an elephant
beware
and his family will grant all their gold
later he will offer me all the gold made for the goddess
only after that
he is giving an oscarwinning performance
who would go against mr presidents orders
gold is a minuscule thing
what do you say guys
let me utilise this opportunity to my benefit before kantam finds this out
 gold and make a humongous cross  ok father
everywhere in the world everyones the same
sir i have saved this gold for my daughters marriage
the world is about to end
let the gold go but i cant tolerate hunger anymore
my stomach is bloating because its empty
bible and quran to make them understand
there is a right time for everything
half the villagers must have pawned their gold here
she is getting angry too
stupid this is my favourite necklace
you have no competition you are incomparable
you have no competition you are incomparable
people should be astounded by your feat
what happened why did you call me
nothing i wanted to have a cigarette
stop it dont act oversmart
my dad will make new ones for me
why everyone is donating are you not
not at all dont do such stupid things
my dad already hates you
he would hate you even more
hey are you eating everything
mom coffee

shiva
exactly i dreamt of you and chitra getting married
i even dreamt of your kids
keep the coffee on the table
mom
 hallelujah  hallelujah hallelujah
shiva
hallelujah
move
hey shiva
if needed i will sell it and buy alcohol with that money
even if the prime minister tells me too
mr bhushan i have a doubt
lord sree vishnu appears in every yug in a different avatar
in that case if lord sree vishnu himself couldnt stop
the destruction of the previous three yugs with all his avatars
how did you believe them sir
who was the other
 huh  just asking
just asking
 what is this  we gave everything what now
what would happen now
shambho shankara
devotee
a deed done here will resonate with the whole world
the whole world will survive the cataclysm
if needed i would sacrifice my life
and i will fight the cataclysm
i shall save our village
this is my oath
sons of the lord ignore that atheist
i would sacrifice my life to save you
hallelujah
he said not only the president but he wouldnt listen to the prime minister
i will outcast him from this village
but you
you want to oppose the villagers and lose the girl you love do you
yes son think about it again
i wont do what i dont believe
thats my selfrespect thats not ego
but i love you more than you can ever imagine since my childhood
now they are merged shiva
they bashed people who told the truth
take it easy
shiva no matter how much you think you have just two options
either live in accordance with society
shiva would never give his rings away
mr daniel forgive me
forgive me mr brahmam
forgive me
mr president forgive me
it was my fault that i questioned your beliefs forgive me for that
but this is my belief
when the whole village is donating their gold whats your problem
i dont see the devotion in this act i see only fear
what are you talking about
he has built so many temples and religious places
even in this i see only selfboasting but not devotion
what are you talking
since the matter has come this far lets settle it here
how dare you how can you wrong the presidents family
come back
siri siri
call her
she is already on the call
nobody from this village will ever talk with your family
think about it once again
if needed i would fall on his feet to forgive us
but please think again
give that
throw the fake ones in the river and we shall pocket these real gold
citing various reasons
im planning a trip to bangkok
what will you do in bangkok
from there ill directly come to bangkok

mom

our choices and desires dont matter to them
but after i grew up
people talk about the dress i wear
but no one cares about my inner feelings
chitra i dont believe in god

youre right that needs to be done
 sweet as honey my 
hey sweetie how was your night
exhausting
no just sleep
oh what a crazy night
i cant believe
aaron
i work here
not much just doing a lot of yard work and uh
a lot of reading
so im really hoping to hear back
thats great
yeah me too
yeah im sure
lets do it
cool
yeah you too
i uh gotta keep putting these books back
okay bye
bye
yeah yeah that sounds great
cool
well im off
okay bye
bye
hey uh you got a minute
yeah sure whats up
hey uh have you been
experiencing anything weird at all lately
you too
so youve seen her
i dont know i was hoping you knew
ive never had to deal with something like this
yeah well theyre both dead
so thats not going to help us
no
you never try to communicate
but we cant just pretend like this isnt happening
no of course not
maybe grandma will know what to do
grandma
got any better ideas
no i guess not
hows your mother doing
yeah thats always been your mother
ever since i can remember
she was making her own money always working
even when she was in school
you remind me so much of her
unfortunately not all men
can handle strong women with patience
your father has always been battling his demons
no
so angry at him i wouldnt wanna talk to him anyway
its okay to be angry
just dont let that lead to bitterness sentiment okay
so about this thing
man that was fun
yeah me too
cant you call it off
so that maybe i can afford to go abroad
during the winter break
really
that sounds exciting
you should
theres a whole world outside of the valley
yeah i hear ya
but my favorite seasonal experience autumn in the midwest
it sounds like it
anyway back to reality
yeah
wanna do a few more laps
lets do it
all right sounds good
that have been happening to us
especially here in this region
this
this is a haunted valley
the streets and the alleyways
looking for a dwelling place
hes prowling around like a roaring lion
looking for someone to devour
the devil
and his demons
i just thought the devil is supposed to be in hell
then youd be wrong
hell was created for him sure
but he and his angels dwell amongst us
he was even tempted by the devil
well were all seeing some kind of humanlike entity
not some kind of devil or demon
the devil can take any form he wants
couldnt it just be the restless spirit
of a woman who passed here in the area
until awakened by god himself
when the day of judgment arrives
that demonic force continues to impersonate that person
it wanders the streets
looking for someone else to attach itself to
how do you know if you have an attachment
they go through an entire lifetime without ever knowing
if you are seeing a physical manifestation of the spirit
then its a good sign because it means
it is still prowling around
however it is also very dangerous
that it has targeted your family
what
you must remain vigilant
how
the enemy tries to find ways to gain access into your home
from the love and protection of god
see we are empty vessels
with bitterness greed hate anger lust
which are open invitations to unclean spirits of the world
remain vigilant
you know i dont think
ive ever taken this path home before
yeah its a bit faster
the what
the old miller house
no
well its only supposed to be
what
yeah
why
but as the legend has it
mrs miller became very depressed
after suffering the loss of a child
her husband mr miller tried to get her help
that were telling her to hurt herself
unfortunately her husband wasnt able to help her
she became lost in her loneliness
after that mr miller was never the same again
anyway its just a ghost legend
yeah
bethany
just get to the point
uh im not uh
we uh wed like to get married
well i hope she knows what shes getting into
yeah
send you the uh divorce papers
that way we can finalize this thing and uh
listen i was hoping you could do me a favor and uh
share the news with the kids for me
let em know yourself
so um do you believe any of that
yeah
how about the ghost part
i dont know im sure theres some truth to the stories
have you ever experienced anything paranormal before
i dont know
i cant say i have
have you
uh
oh my goodness you have havent you
id rather you not think
i envy you
trust me you do not wanna experience anything paranormal
well maybe just a little
well this is where we split up
yeah i had a really nice time
me too
um call me
yeah of course
cool
ill see you soon
 bye  bye
 everything you feel 
maybe hes right
i dont wanna experience anything paranormal
what how do you know
apparently some lady committed suicide there
after having suffered from depression
when was this
i dont know exactly
mayra says people claim to have seen her
thats it
what
grandma was telling me that
what
they can attach themselves to
okay
dont you see
this entity is probably the same spirit
that attached itself to this poor woman
might have been what led her
what
so the spirit wants to attach itself to one of us
i dont know she didnt say
what
okay okay i probably shouldve asked
you think
 baby why did you leave me 
 why did you leave me leave me behind 
 i dont know that 
thank you
youre welcome
 yeah  hows yours
i might have to get another one before we leave
so im sorry to hear
things arent going great with your dad
yeah thanks
its exhausting
but you just have to forgive your dad
well look at it this way
just because you love and forgive someone
doesnt mean you always have to agree with their choices
you just have to release someone that
my dad
no you aaron
you need to release what youve been holding in
be free
well while your dad made his choices
so i wouldnt let anger in
bitterness will just eat you up inside
itll eat you alive
maybe youre right
of course i am
be the aaron ive come to know
which aarons that
the nice aaron
the nice aaron
stop
can i be bad
stop
im very worried about you and the children

johnny
hello
mom

aaron
aaron
you leave us alone
stop following us
you cant have us
you cant have my children
from the grips of demonic oppression
can be fought with prayer and fasting
so i have been praying and fasting for you and your family
what are you doing
whats that
its an old biblical practice
consecrate
to set apart
its not some kind of mystical thing that im doing here
so that no ungodly spirit may enter
that your angels stand guard
now its time to anoint you
what
to be used solely for you
protect him from the evil one and all his demons
i renounce the devil
i renounce the devil
yeah i think so
bethany
 mom  come in

no mom im just gonna head home
howd you know i was here mom
hey uh gps tracking app on your phone

the flies are coming in
come on
you okay mom
i dont know what came over me
i started feeling so strange
yeah hes right
i dont know whats happening to me i just
oh i feel faint
ill get you some water
i think i think that entity is trying to take over you
what
and i thought it was you
you know what
what
i have never felt so afraid in my life
i just
thank you mom
what
oh
wait oil what oil
youll see
that spirit cannot get a hold of you
if you surrender yourself to god
look to god let go of that resentment
dont let it eat you
dont let it consume you
let go of
dont let it eat you alive
if you surrender yourself to god
lay your sorrows at his feet
that spirit of sadness
 go your own way 
 go your own way  you will never be free
 turn to face the sun 
 youre not on the run 
and restless spirits will continue to roam
like a roaring lion
looking for someone to devour
an effort to steal your joy kill your hopes
and destroy your dreams
 it will guide you  remain vigilant
 to the place you call home 
 the wildest call in you 
 you know what to do 
a prince
he was a delicate child
and very beautiful
he never complained
perhaps i wasnt prepared to listen
i never gave much thought to kuttas mother or father
but i believed them to be dead
i wasnt really capable of great tenderness
i was always afraid he might break
he always came home from school with good grades
and he had no difficulty speaking french
which was after all purely imaginary
my father who ran a nursery in sussex
had given me a french destiny
i returned regularly to england to visit him
and to bring back perennials from his nursery
which were still quite rare in france
when i came across this study
based on some tests they carried out
when i saw that i thought it was so beautiful
its like a musical score
i want to make that real
i want to make it concrete
so that people can see it smell it touch it etc
so we cant
possibly in a greenhouse some of them anyway
but a large number of them can be grown outdoors in normandy
in the project you have all the calycanthus
theyre all there
to escape the thatcher years in england
had joined me
he works on some of the estates in varengevillesurmer
and wasnt short of advice for me
he had embarked on a crazy botanical project
when i took over the school
i saw all sorts of kids arriving from very different backgrounds
inspired and inscrutable
in short
he was the first child before kutta
quillworts
its your last chance i was warned
the town where i was born and which i hated
where id had my first sexual experiences
i was a shy introverted child
and i suffered from recurring nightmares
on the rounded hill covered with oaks and beeches
at least they seemed to want to make me human
and things started going badly wrong in my parents lives
i can no longer bear
to be around you
what is not within my power
perhaps even my life
roger
my mother has always been an avid reader
of british and american fantasy novels
she was convinced that a spirit she called roger
she had imaginary conversations with roger
she called me peter
her alcoholism only exacerbated her romanticism
she and my father argued all the time now
but if you find it easier you can use your secateurs
thats fine too
and holds the flowers in place
since its a long piece ive put the leaves in first
im trimming everything
 hello mrs brown  hello amélie
 how are you  fine
thank you
 good morning  hello
 id like a word with pierrejoseph  go ahead
 hello mrs brown  hello pierrejoseph
how is pierrejoseph getting on
its for a wedding
at the training and apprenticeship college in yvetot
the 32 pairs of eyes watching me
pierrejoseph looked the other way
he caught me unawares
the morning dragged
in spite of the optimistic tone i was trying
because of your passion for plants and books alberto
because you are well travelled
from your direct observation of landscapes and people
at home where they are at
this is a special year
indeed it was the child her marriage had denied her
had just arrived
i was touched by the young kutta
by his thin face with its mix of indian and tibetan traits
his lightbrown skin over a frail body
like so many others i had seen
like a plant how could i not think that
he said nothing
despite being on the receiving end from his classmates
of all the children in my care
my mother threw my father out of the house
he sought refuge in his hunting lodge in huglevilleencaux
a few kilometres from the house
the lodge was always full of hunting friends
their passion was to drink and eat
sometimes i found my cousin there
and we made love
he had an attractive cock with a pert glans
a nice belly to set it off
and balls that nestled nicely between his thighs
has everyone been served
i had recently met mino a bakers apprentice
you must have some idea
if you go out scouting and you see tracks and rooting
then theyre here
 thats too early  youll disturb them
youd be better off going two days before
theyre nocturnal
 not yet no  no
yes and no
meaning
you have to pass various tests now
theres are practical tests and theory tests
and you have to identify an animal footprint
or in a hunting situation
i became friends with alberto my botany teacher
my mother kept threatening to kill us my father and i
or to commit suicide
and begged me to push her down them
hello
i tried to stop her drinking
and there wasnt much i could do
françoise encouraged my mother to let me carry on
to convince her she told her i was an artist
how much
okay
goodbye
yes im fine
yes
i filmed in bhopal we arrived in the night
i heard horns honking i could see lorries in the distance
and i thought
and it was very moving
and i thought of that boy i was trying to find
we ran towards one another
we hugged one another and cried
i had met a boy who was already
never to return
i had been that boy
capable of telling barefaced lies
of betrayal without remorse
to feel a steady hand weighing on my body
alberto had initiated me in love in the names of flowers
and in poets such as novalis and denys
he sent me his first collection of poems
it was accompanied by a letter
telling me hed be spending the summer in portugal
to take him back to yvetot
mino came in my mouth
to hide in my fathers dirty laundry cupboard
to inhale the pissstained crotch
of his white eminence underpants
remembering sunday evenings at the house
when on returning from the hunt
the water caused his penis to swell and he stroked it
which to me seemed
i wanted to live in the cabin
my mother was strongly opposed to the idea
the cabin had been burgled
i felt at peace there
the cabin had been violated
and it was a relief
all that remained was a photograph
i turned the image upsidedown
to give the hares some dignity back
saint huberts chapel
dedicated to the animals slaughtered by my forefathers
 hello mr aubry  hello
here
 hello  pierrejoseph
odile
 hello  hello there
hes come to work for you as part of his apprenticeship
great
come on then well show you round the greenhouses
my new employer was called mr aubry
adrien
kutta often had skin problems
his skin was so delicate
i remember the doctor suggesting at the time
the child flatly refused
reassuring me that he was fine
and he wasnt at all worried
what is this yellow
piss and linseed oil
i had left the cabin
to sleep at her mothers house
sometimes she allowed me lying to her mother
to spend the night with alberto
sylvie worked in a bookshop
where she regularly saw françoise
sometimes accompanied by her adoptive son
thats how every now and again i heard news of kutta
rosier evêque
rosier cuspidé
a beautiful plant
you need to leave
if you dont get enough of the root
the dandelions grow back
listen youve brought me luck
i could cry
ive managed to cultivate quillworts
theres a huge clump here
its incredible
there are more
its this these little rosettes
thats it
a place of ill repute
i met my previous ex there too
he went to jean rostand college
hes really into horticulture and all that
but
so there was nothing to build on
you know what they say about narcissism
being narcissistic is the opposite of selflove
its a lack of selfesteem
what about you
you turn me on
on saturdays i went with adrien
to pavilly market to sell plants
we left early enough to give us time to make love
before getting set up
the market stall opposite ours
belonged to a beekeeper called moïse
he was a sturdy man
when you passed his stall
an enthusiasm amongst the students
as for pierrejoseph he remained silent
then sometime later one night after making love
i heard him murmur
yes well make a film
adrien gave me five weeks off
to go with alberto to film the himalayan flora
alberto would film the flowers and i would draw them
we were excited when we got there
to find the flowers that we grow in our gardens
such as macleaya cordata and meconopsis
when the walker finally understands
that even though the path always leads back home
it was really quite beautiful
that part was very beautiful
alberto you feel bored in town
and it will be more convenient for seeing pierrejoseph
as taking a stray animal into the house
we screened memory of a garden in the school courtyard
in contrast with the noisy wonderment of his classmates
kuttas distress was palpable
the landscapes were imprinted on him
kutta was a very handsome young man now
he had decided to embark on a trip to india
he didnt suggest we make the trip with him
at a distance from my heart
i was scared of losing him
retreating into his search for a new birth
kutta was imbued with something invisible
that he was dedicating himself to
it gave him a certain haughtiness
a combination of arrogance and contemplation
after odile died
i suggested to moïse
that he place some hives in the woods
he taught me the first principles of beekeeping
i was fascinated
his strength gentleness and love of bees
come ordet
come
where did you learn to draw
i told them it was 50 years since
its cold
 eh  its nice and cold
its nice and cold
his heart gave up
in rue de loiseau bleu in saintwandrille
now that moïse was dead
i took care of his orphaned colonies
pierrejoseph had grown older
he had no difficulty finding clients
who had frequented adriens nursery
like lots of local people
she was passionate about horticulture
where she collected all sorts of climbing plants
especially akebia
which proliferated among the endemic creepers
commonly known in france as battered wives herb
this woman of the soil
my client with akebia quinata hair
she exerted a sort of fascination over him
and over the course of his visits
he dreamed of a black house
above a sea of brambles and roses
in this forest like any enclosed space
so i naturally set my sights on the far edge of the forest
that we began to clear le roncier
for our black maria
five metres by six
all made of wood resting on stilts
with a corrugated iron roof and weatherboard cladding
about a small ad in lunion agricole
for a gardening job at the valmont estate
and felt it was his mission to save it
i thought of you he said
i remember your arrival in france i said
i like the silences between us he said behind my back
as for me i was embarrassed by his youth and beauty
he suddenly asked me
my renaissance château would make a good backdrop no
the prince told me about his sleepless nights
about how stretched out on his bed
hed bingewatched all 73 episodes
but also to amateur bdsm porn videos
which prevented me from taking any pleasure in our session
the next morning i demanded an explanation
he tied himself in knots
telling me the dog had been abandoned
by the previous mafia owners
for fear that it might run away
i felt sick
its okay dog its okay
i have almost 15000 followers
mockingly i have over 15000 followers
kali well what do you have like three
only for another month im about to move on campus
yeah

lindsay holy shit oh my god
oh barbara
kali barbara
dr b remember
oh yeah
how sad
dan how do we define whos at fault
or the murderer
tommy to me it seems like
palsgraf would be a good example here
onto the train uh
an independent act of negligence
on the employee or the company
um which breaks the chain of causation
i meant in regards to criminal cases not civil
and i certainly hope on the exam
when you answer questions you give more concise answers
dont just regurgitate the courts opinion
its the law
palsgraf establishes
kelsey back up bryce
the guy can barely even walk right
lets just calm down here

bacterial infection maybe
and lactate to gauge levels on medium term consequences
shes going into convulsions
i have pulses and electrical activity in the systemic heart
what do you need
we have to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation
100 micrograms epinephrine
prep one dose lidocaine
one magnesium chloride in case we have to remove the tag
the stuff from eden zoo had to be destroyed
100 micrograms now
here
five
10 seconds

with our planets most exotic creatures
so come step into that world of wonder
the vets did an ultrasound on our dolphin hannah
last week and nothing came back abnormal
with heart failure
but i have never seen a dolphins condition
ugh
oh um
am i too early
i can come back
no hi joe youre youre fine
what do you want me to do about disposal
oh
we have to recycle her
mm
me neither
hannah deserves better
rolling her out
instead of hannah
its too bad
oh
hey ellen ive got a morning feed
whats up
daniel im checking to make sure that
from our facility were destroyed
yeah i handled it myself
our logistics firm moved all the doses
out of the veterinary wing
moved
do you hear me
anytime one of our team members is called out
they must submit and execute a disposal form
i mean none of that product has expired
there was an incident
to the dosage
burn it and use whatever you have on reserve
but you need to call and confirm now
no it is confirmed
that has no storage space at their facility
of anything they pick up at our lab
youre sure positive
yeah yeah its all good
everythings taken care of
no and i appreciate that and we do not want that either
thank you for confirming daniel
you are welcome byebye
i gotta go
hey good morning
im one of the senior aquarists here

we work on a tunnel system here
so they have to swim through that portal in order to feed
ooh
hey theyre pretty quick
oh yeah they are amazing
they have 12 serrated teeth on the upper jaw 11 on the lower
you definitely dont want these bad boys taken up in a tornado
why would a shark be in a tornado
you know cause of the
yeah never mind its a boomer joke
but im a fan favorite of the walrus
you know theyre like gentle giants you know
like those tusks man
no no no theyre never in the same habitat
huh
the tusks of a walrus and the serrated teeth of a maco
i think youd lose that bet
dan here on that vip feed like i told you

christie meet me at the veterinary
im on it
ill be down in a second
oh right
i mean our connection network is so antiquated
we could put the components on display
look we need a new heating and cooling system
for all of the enclosures
our animal safety mechanisms are so inadequate
because we dont even have a highspeed network connection
what about an online store
there you go thatll generate some revenue
write that down
great get me the funding
that we can bring in new sponsors and donors
you might be the ceo and president of this facility
and youre very much appreciated for it
we do for this facility
of the fiscal year okay
doing great here
every penny that goes into this facility
wow
youre saying this was an octopus
slow down slow down
okay
what happened dr james
we must close the duct before it gets out
and theres no telling the level of toxic bacteria
gotcha
okay we gotta move fast
unfortunately every vent has to be shut down manually
yeah
miranda
do you hear me miranda
miranda do you copy
christie christie come in
hey clu go for christie
possibly inside of the ducts
it killed two of our vet techs
copy
copy that
so for example on tuesdays and fridays
we have started doing a vip experience
if we started to do more of this then maybe we could
karen
karen whats wrong what happened
sorry about this hannah
i know mirandas devastated
and uh
dr james what happened
it killed them and it almost killed me
 what  wait
who is dead what is she talking about
the octopus

it went into cardiac arrest
and now its crawled into the duct
okay we are officially closing for the day
and were going on the lockdown
clu can you come in copy

this animal has become reanimated

ill get on the boat and get help
christie
christie christie wait

would you stop
please just stay calm
dont be sorry just stay calm
well be out of here soon just relax
just as long as we can get the failsafe protocols released
is through cellphones
and if the surveillance systems are down

all right number one dude that is speciest
two otters are mammals
theres just fish tanks theres no mammals
okay but what about them sharks

why it worked for the fish
there are 100 species of wildlife
through hundreds of thousands of gallons of water
its reinforced with lucite
its engineered not to break
well the fish figured it out
it wont work
whats behind them before theyre open
oh god

ow

starfish

you have to crush their radial nerve
that is crazy
that kind of starfish isnt supposed
water pumps through its body not blood
to get here on time to save your life
theyre mostly nontoxic
except for the blueringed which is lethal
is that a blueringed one
no
dr hyde was bitten and died from acute paralysis
is also making their secretions more potent
theyre dead
but not dead
huh
must have been spread across the aquarium like a virus
but clu is trying to get us out of here right
yeah but after the last three times
we could try the roof
there is a door theres an access door there
yeah yeah we go where theres no water right
we go to the roof and we call for help
and maybe somebody from the street will see us
maybe yeah
im pretty sure its locked
no no i come down here all the time
it just needs a little elbow grease
you sure about that
dude i work out all the time
okay heman
hey whats that over there
dude so uncalled for
yeah
dude i think you are getting a refund

its bad
is covered with grease or slime i guess
i think the octopus left it here
theres something happening to the animals
listen clu were in the theater box office
at the moment no i dont
but at the time i have no operational capability
a half hour
would somebody please tell me why this desk
that console monitors all of the security
and all of the surveillance on the entire property
wonderful
what about getting out from there
uh no go
now those doors arent designed
to keep out flooding only fires
going to keep on moving until its safely to do so
 copy  copy that
be careful out there
 marvelous  well keep moving
and check back with you later
gotcha
oh yeah
this scars gonna get me laid
man this place is rank
yeah
so why a nurse
why not doctor you know make the cash
really
middleaged
besides management just isnt for me
plans huh really
aw damn
not those spider crabs again
okay okay i think we need to move up into the aquarium
the aquarium not the fish tanks
whats the difference
okay get your phone out
look i know i was making a joke
this is gonna lead us to the aquarium
with the sharks
theyre in tanks
will you hold still
go go
okay look
and theres a staircase all right
so were just gonna move to this real fast
and were gonna be in the aquarium
yes that are in tanks
okay
after you
shh
lets just go lets just go lets go go go go go
you are freaking me out buddy
just keep it together
what you scared for you got the ax
will you please
im behind you with nothing
there
and be smart out there too
copy that
this starfish has cutaneous abrasions
and tissue decay consistent with the onset
of marine epizootic similar to ssws
well i havent noticed any limb impairment
or limited mobility
but im not ruling out bacterial contamination
yeah
jesus
you crushed its nervous system
dead but not dead
what
hey clu clu
and do not touch any of the slime
no no way am i touching that slime
and im not going anywhere we need to find a way out
weve never seen anything like this
and it could be contagious
and we really dont know whats causing it
im gonna try to get these cameras up and running
i dont like you all running around blindly
without knowing whats around the corner
especially because were not exactly sure
what were up against
thank you clu well keep moving
ill check back with you later
copy that
lets see what we got
come on give me something
okay im gonna get you guys out of here
but i need to find a map
come help me find one
yes
no
oh i found some
yes i just need to
oh oh yeah
what are you smiling at
oh i dont feel so good
hey focus
i really feel like im gonna pass out
hey you lost a lot of blood man
oh
hey ill be right back
okay
whered he go
hey here you gotta drink this
you you saved my life back there
hey hey
youre a tour guide
hey i just remembered
what
seriously is that one locked too
you wanna show me
jacked up my knee
youre a tough guy you can shake it off
ah
for what
im still the tour guide
yeah dispatch no hot spots no people
place is empty
theres another outage at the aquarium
somethings gotta be going on
104 copy that
shh
thats a crocodile
negative no
we have a citywide grid outage
 how long  60 minutes
weve gotta find a way in there
you should have gotten a girlfriend
well maybe i thought the tour guide was gonna be a girl
what was that
ah
okay so the sea lion habitat is both indoor and outdoor
its about 15 feet
well the only problem is that sea lion habitat
is in quadrant one
and the fire doors are shut very tight
so if we can figure out a way to get through the quadrant
we can get out
thats the plan
but we cant let any of these animals get out to the public
and destruction that would occur as a result
we can wedge it from the outside
and its probably still on the move in the ducts
wait
we never had a chance to bring it online
but i could log on to the network and initiate the signal
okay yes
everything else is down
okay
so well go get your phone
is because of our backup generators
but who knows how long that will last
okay
thats the plan
okay
now what
well we have two options
we can either go this way or that way
and that way is flooded so
so thats not an option so were going this way
great
i have an idea
this is the educational lab
its been under construction for a few weeks
theres been flooding in here too
no
its the only way well get to the sea lion habitat
okay there you go
thank you
and then dr james and i will follow behind you
okay
the marine science gallery its got a different color carpet
and then just drop down in there
okay
different color carpet got it
uh i dont know about this
okay well unfortunately
mmhm
just give me your hand
okay okay okay okay
oh no no i have this
okay
okay karen lets go
okay
i cannot believe you lost our phones
i dont like this
i dont like this at all
oh god oh i want to get down

oh my god
joe

oh my god
this is just like the syringe i used on the octopus
oh my god ez
eden zoo
i thought that was destroyed
daniel told me he burned them
that theory is totally wacked miranda
there has to be a normal logical
then why did dr rogers tell us to get rid of the injectors
bad lots happen all the time
and i told you i got rid of them
i dont know maybe logistics screwed up
and one of them mixed in with the stable lot
to register the telemetry tag on the octopus
it may be this fiberglass insulation
so how do you explain these syringes
i dont know miranda
no
so if you want to talk to me about anything that you know
you tell me right now
im telling you i dont know anything
this is an aquarium
hundreds of thousands
forget that come on lets take the stairs
hey i got it

the failsafe locking mechanisms are electronic
and absolutely none of them are responding
so nothing or no one is getting out of here
copy
how is she working on the console
if this whole place is out of power
because the console has a backup battery
it was the last thing to get upgraded six years ago
ive tried to reroute the power to the alternate generator
it needs to be switched on manually
hey clu were in the sea lion habitat

these documents were burnt
the mutation on the island
is probably due to contamination from the experiments they were conducting
when human beings pollute nature
it is human beings themselves who ultimately get polluted
lets look carefully
and see what clues we can find
theres a door here
this group of people doing harm to society
but leading an enjoyable life
bro

smells good
lets all
spend the night here tonight and rest

she should have
been wearing a beautiful wedding dress
and the ring that i picked out for her myself
shes like you
shes a journalist
she is your socalled predecessor
the evidence of the cass medical groups crimes
in the hope that
there will be no more victims
she has lost her life on the job
were all sorry about her death
we admire her very much
she must still be looking over you
thats why weve been able to live until now
when a journalist is close to the truth
it is the closest to death
so
come on heroine
i apologize
for the way i treated you before
i was impulsive
i should apologize to you for that
lets take down the cass medical group
then
after going to court
boss
i think we should keep no 2 experimental body
the regenerative cells in its body
if i succeed in extracting it
not only can it cure your illness
but it can also be distributed worldwide
dr q
are you sure
you can control
this experimental body
no problem
i just need a little more time
a little
dr q
if the experiment fails
boss

enjoy yourself
causing extremely serious social impact their chairman ren junyi has been arrested
will we know what we are what we have chosen to be
angel or demon
creature of light or monster clothed in human flesh
he said i could choose that i had a choice
the silver service i think not the china
miss maud
i must for a moment
speak not of your fathers recent death but of his judgment
your uncle is hardly a fit person
i look forward imminently to that happy event
your uncle silas was a most expensive vicious young man
an acquaintance rather
married beneath himself though to do him justice
i fail to see why a youthful mésalliance
should we fail to take into account
and consider the implications of the historic
you proposed to be blunt doctor
that gambler took his own life
perhaps youd care to view the suicide room captain
in your new capacity as trustee
another time possibly thank you
if you would care to mount a challenge
you may remain trustees of my property
rather than my own flesh and blood
i will not challenge the will
or my fathers choice of guardian
 theres no shame in that  im not ashamed
but because my father was deeply bitterly conscious
of his brothers disgrace
you may go
oh my goodness how exciting
my dear cousin
my dear cousin maud
i am so out of breath
so delighted but so fatigued after our dreadful journey
my fathers been shown to his room
my brother about the place somewhere
the stables i expect
what good friends we shall be
ive put you in the room next but one to mine
we had a lovely walk today
dont rush your fences boy
uncle
you are most welcome
dear child i rejoice to meet you
truly rejoice
my daughter emily has made your acquaintance
the foundations of a lasting friendship
pray allow me to present my son your cousin edward
where is your gallantry kiss your cousin sir
you modern young women are so correct
and all the more alluring for your modesty
your servant cousin
cousin edward
hmm
ill serve go on back down
i hadnt thought about it
you must of course consider everything in this house
perfectly at your disposal
come
may the lord bless you and make you all that i could wish
serve miss maud at once
yes sir
not very
you play pianoforte
a little
i must hear you
by and by
mary quince and i planned it
mrs rusk the housekeeper
mary quince
my maid servant
than contemplate my mortification in the next
you are an heiress
i am madame the governess de votre cousine
you mademoiselle having of course nothing to learn
pas du tout have no need of one
not these three years past
my most gracious hostess
you have done so good night
that is my fathers desk
as it was my fathers before him
evidently neither was much for paperwork
ha
piquet
faro loo
i do not care to play sir
hmm
ground rent
rent roll
liquid assets
your trustees intend to keep a tight rein
on the purse strings
 they are ridiculous arent they  you neednt mind them
i suggest an alliance what do you say
i believe uncle
come
my dear brother
he told you of me
yes
what
great faults and great wrongs
your talents have not availed you
your faults you repented for long ago
but the wrongs done to you are still very sore
cousin maud
are you quite well
is hardly likely to tire me
youll have some tea edward
you sinner edward now maud isnt he a sinner
case of turtle i should think and get in some hock
do you care for hock niece
above all things uncle
my daughter makes a noise like a pig
no sir
i beg your pardon maud
and also some claret rusk
two cases
three
as you wish
emily come
see if you just adjust the sight line here and here
goodness
im sorry if i offended you cousin
the weather is rather changeable here
touch of neuralgia
my father was similarly afflicted
emilys governess
 yes  you dont wish for me to obey her
only to be polite
shes not my governess
shes not responsible for your conduct certainly
yes my dear brother has appointed me to act in loco parentis
but i shant wield my authority without cause
how i will enjoy introducing you to society
a climbing holiday perhaps
i was just your age when your father and i first went
his youthful passion i understand
im afraid i dont share it
while in mourning or even halfmourning
hmm
as to whether madame being a french woman
and therefore clever with her needle
well should you present your request
with sufficient charm i may drop a hint
a measure of docility
a much better scheme
dont be vexed
no but i shant trouble you with small matters of business
oh yes
i had no idea
they found him half out of bed his head hanging down
and his throat cut by his own hand
how horrid
they scrubbed and scrubbed
did your father not tell you all this
no
theres no suspicion attached to him
my fathers reputation was ever unsullied
im afraid the same cannot be said for yours
ill mention to my uncle youve been asking shall i
no dont
confess
confess
it makes no sense at all
youngest scion of our name
and my daughter miss emily ruthyn
i trust i find you well miss ruthyn
very well thank you
tea cousin
she is very striking isnt she
but we have overcome the deficit as you see
a hunting man i understand
my nieces foxes will be trembling in their rank little dens
no thank you
you are and i mean no disrespect by this
unschooled in the ways of society
i certainly hope so
than your experience
pray excuse me if i take a great liberty
you are a prize you know
i do know
if theres any service i can render
anything at all that i can do
for my property i am to presume
indeed of course for your property
the good captain will find an heiress tres convenient
the good captain thinks more of his wine his horse
a shrewd suspicion of the object of this teteatete
i havent the slightest conception kindly move aside
you know that it is totally impossible
and a charming girl such as yourself
to meet continually as we do
without a liking growing on one side or another
i suppose i neednt pretend to be violently in love
please dont continue
beg pardon
mmhmm
a sincere attachment
most sincere
you do me too much honor sir
dash it
have the goodness to let me pass
you will excuse the intrusion
but i have not forgotten if you have
that my authority as guardian
gives me the right to question your conduct
that you contemptuously rejected the hand of my son
i rejected it certainly
with no more contempt than the question was put to me
but under your tutelage he will improve
really my dear think of the advantages
what could be better than taking your own blood to wed
better surely
not to marry a man for whom i have no regard
not i trust in the direction of a certain captain
who makes nothing by his profession
wise girl
you have something of the look of your poor mother
im afraid i dont remember her
no delicate girl
sad
my sons impetuousness has taken you by surprise
i require no further
i yield my dear i shall not press you
you shall have time your own time to think
i will accept no answer now
hurry up youre letting the cold in
a tribute to your beaux yeux my dear
will find the arrival of bailiffs
more compelling than your posy
this matter to my regret
does not concern you or your property but rather my own
there will be no bailiffs at knowl
your creditors have caught wind of the fee
compensating you for my guardianship
mm
ready money is not something
i have frequently been troubled with
perhaps i might communicate with my trustees
about releasing some funds
what unwanted generosity
if youd care to uncle
im on tenterhooks
tell me how do you propose to inveigle your trustees
for securing your departure from knowl
and if i decline your so generous offer
then i regret very much that the bailiffs will indeed arrive at knowl
and i will make sure they understand what is mine
and what is yours and therefore fair game
i dont mind waiting a bit
im in no rush to have a wife on my back
oh very obliging of you
im no hand at playacting
of a preux chevalier charging up to carry me off
surely you want someone
i mean i neednt trouble you much
which he has been so obliging as to repeat
without one word of discouragement
there have been no attentions to speak of
i have sought no attentions
however to be on the safe side uncle
towards my cousin your son
you are excused
pray excuse me
there is something you should know
we once made a bargain my brother and i
when that gamester took the cowards way out
 and put an end to himself  ah
you play too deep all of you
that is true at least
the loss was mine
your father staked me
that cant possibly be true
well luckily that other eventuality transpired
i dont understand
that is a foul implication
your father took the steps required to preserve his fortune
what steps the door was locked from the inside
you lie youre a liar
i speak truth unaccustomed as you are to hearing it
uncle
he was always the better climber
the taint of suspicion was to be mine mine alone
as one day so would be knowl
that was the bargain
mm
oh yes
guardianship of you
the trust with which he placed you wholly within my power
though sadly not my expected inheritance
excuse me miss
if mademoiselle has any petite commissions
no thank you
madame attend to mademoiselles petite daffaires
you mustnt trouble yourself to go out
jet buttons
thank you uncle
 tea  brandy
you says one man of experience to another
 still childbearing hips  pater
fine eyes and a pretty little foot and ankle
oh dont
its so lovely
we could be sisters
it is enough that we are cousins
edward
ill accept your apology in the morning
now get out
no
no
get out of my room get out
 get out  quiet
 no  shh
or pretend to resist
no no no no
no
edward edward
edward look at me
dont do this
dont do
coffee please rusk
moderately well niece and yourself
immoderately poorly as im sure youre aware
but i must thank you all for your kind concern
i do think youve been a little cruel my dear
if there has been an excess of gallantry
you only have yourself to blame
my charms i make no doubt are near as numberless
as the quantity of pounds lodged in my bank account
your son deigns to rape me
my decision is unalterable
i will not marry your son
well im afraid no respectable man
will take a soiled article to his bed and board
i find myself not much disposed towards marriage uncle
do you think it so little my heart
yes miss
 see to them then  yes miss
the carriage please rusk
no miss
i require the carriage please rusk
if necessary ill drive it myself
im sorry miss
the master said no miss
i am your mistress
 get down  no
 youll hurt yourself  come on go go
let me lift you down
get your hands off me step back
mary quince i need you to post a letter
i wont again
ilbury

captain
captain wait
 mama sing me back to sleep 
 dont 
 cut 
 me 
 off 
very sorry miss
doctor
miss ruthyn do come in
how would you say youve been feeling miss ruthyn
a tad confined i would say thank you dr bryerly
and yourself
concerned dear that youve been unwell
we shall soon have you put right do not agitate yourself
im not at all agitated
youre to remain perfectly quiet
im fortunate then to have at least one of my trustees to look after me
as the consent of both of us is required
be so good as to explain yourself
no such things
doctor a word
leave it with me
you have three years until your majority
and captain ilbury does he share your opinion
in certain nervous states
a likely progression to violence of action
to selfdestruction even
more or less disagreeable depending on the patient
hmm
even the most hardened cases
respond to cold water treatment
iron has a tendency to rust
thirty minutes for the most obdurate cases
something between 10 and 13 tons of water in that time
tons
no you are correct
irregular vibrations of the nerves
due to the peculiarities of the female constitution
couldnt sleep
nor i
you know less bucolic
ill leave the candle will i
lets get you back to bed miss
no just lace me up tightly
i can see youre a great deal under the weather today
a period of seclusion nourishing food rest
and no reading
or drawing
stand
stand or i will have mr and mrs rusk
lift you to your feet
youre an intelligent girl
perhaps when you offered to overturn my fathers will
all this difficulty
so unnecessary
submit
do you know what the medical profession prescribes
as a surefire cure for hysteria
at weekly intervals
but one doesnt need a panel of doctors
far less a magistrate to secure urgent treatment
for a troubled young family member in a benevolent institution
solely the signature of one doctor
our kind friend dr bryerly say
but you will be better away from here
but if i contest your treatment
ill wager me and then i will be made a ward of the court
and you will be removed
of what do you think to accuse me
approval of the match my impetuous son
has been rather too determined to make
i cannot be held responsible for any action of his however reprehensible
hmm
say 50
done
when you are under the care of a physician
50000 pounds to be paid at once by my trustees
at my majority i will guarantee you and my dear cousins
50000 pounds to be paid at once
will secure you respite from any further marital proposals
edward shall go
i prefer to remain at knowl
in my fathers house there are many mansions
detente
the carriage will be around directly sir
i should wait until after dinner
the master has called the carriage sir
dinner downstairs this evening miss
 thats plenty mary quince  mrs rusk will do for you tonight
well the master wouldnt trust her for it
mr ruthyn i mean
 theyll be so long away  both my cousins
so says mr ruthyn
how we will miss them
depart the ancestral halls
it therefore becomes necessary
that your importunity should trouble her no longer
i dont follow sir
my daughter shall accompany him
a spell at a french convent will do wonders for you
et moi
indeed monsieur
but i shant be required to task it further
monsieur
silas
i beg your pardon
youll not part me from our daughter
my dear madame
i fear youre not quite yourself this evening
emily dont let him do this
dont
emily look at me please
emily please my darling my own girl my own please
 dont touch me dont  please please please
 all right enough  please
you are of course perfectly free to accompany your mother
no thank you sir
emily
 no no  now now
come on youre quite worn out
i suggest you retire and rest up
before you go
must i really go
must i repeat myself
and maud
remains at knowl with me
unless you would find a period abroad productive
i shall of course remain at knowl
miss
spiced claret
master says im to undress you
and i say you are not
my silence was a condition of my employment
and yet you blame me and not him
you chose not to trust me with your secret
but i couldnt tell you
but i thought you knew
you did know
i thank you for your service
madame
maud
such distress surely youre content youve banished my brother and me
i would like to give you a memento
a family piece if youd care to choose something
if you wish
here
lie back
put her out
i thought you might do the honors sir
feet first she jumped
an irrevocable impulse of the unbalanced mind
as the good doctor will confirm
theres no need to reproach yourself
 we gave her every chance  pater i
dont be such a girl
pater its emily
darling maud
shall we go out together in a blaze of glory
i have an idea you go out and ill stay here
glory neednt come into it
so tell me uncle
and i would think that you in your delicate situation
the kind you showed me for example
i would have loved you
you do love me
were the same you and i
then why should my life be forfeit
and not yours
i gave you every chance
father
maud
captain ilbury
captain
captain
captain
 oh captain  its all right its all right
my father is dead
come inside its all right
we didnt know where to turn
my poor cousin is quite distraught
youd only to say the word i wouldve come to you
madame is also dead
a double tragedy
the prospect of emily being schooled abroad
and no longer requiring a governess
an insanity even
indeed im not altogether sure of my uncles state of mind
devastated he was at the prospect
that you had also expressed an intent to leave knowl
america
australia i thought
australia
i will so miss her when shes away at school
the direful knowledge of good and evil
i wonder how i lived through that terrible ordeal
behold the day cometh that shall burn like a furnace
and all the proud and everyone that doth wickedness
shall be stubble
my father always said
angels and demons monsters and spirits
lies to the liars
and truth to the one who comes after me
angels and monsters do walk among us
the trick is to tell which is which
i like…
i like you june
i like you june
i like you june
i like you too phing
destiny
not the main male lead
june…
has lots of followers
dont really like her
fake annoyingggg
during the second and third year guy didnt really know her in particular
the two were always bumping into each other
excuse me
do you have any coins i can borrow
sure
i do…
thanks
until one day
a magic moment…
a ship was made
but now its not is it
here thank you
hey
like what
greedy
but we cant equally be at fault
youre more at fault than me
fine
i wont tell anyone then
promise
im going
hey guy i need your advice
im interested in this girl give me a pickup line
phing
i dont know im impatient
i just want to try my luck
uh…
then try this
walk over to her
dont say anything
but send her a text telling her you like her
in front of her
damn
thats awesome
you know im joking right
your mind is antianti social network huh
thanks a lot bro
sure
guy didnt understand
but the joke is on phing
because guy knows that phing never carries an umbrella on him
damn you voice over
are you god or what
sure
i dont really like the movie the classic
oh tah you came as well
hi master guy
oh i told june
that youre my master
you came up with that pickup line
youre quite sappy
june
is this sexual harassment
guy has three siblings
wow
hey awesome

offer food to girls first
actually just the first two bites is enough
shell then say…

black out
no one uses words like black short fat skinny anymore
dead
all right
umm…
can we
or not
but…
it should be fine
wow thats so awesome
it makes me want to have some siblings as well
actually not everything can be used
its not working out
actually theres a way to check
what the other person is feeling
but when youre closer
you touch their shoulder…
arm…
and…
next their hand
wrong
i think this spot is better
its between intentional or not
its a sensitive spot
its what they call the death spot
well
but you have to do it naturally
if not youll be accused of sexual harassment

we come in herds stuffed in buses and trains
we come with nothing
our fathers have nothing
they all slog under the scorching sun just like my father
but you should know we dont come emptyhanded
we never give up
our will is rock solid
and this will isnt bred in some fancy school
it is born from the hopes and dreams of millions of indians
our will is our wealth
winning and losing is all part of life naval

then why cheat in the first place
yes maam very wrong
and everyone cheated except for me
had i cheated id have passed with a 1st division like in 10th
took me almost 19 years
but i was the happiest
that day i realized
those in power never want to let it go
if the poor remain uneducated
educate agitate and organize
with such provocative statements you should aim for a career in politics
sorry sir
you talk big
i dont think you fit in here
no sir i do fit

mr sharma let me tell you one last thing
if sir edmund hillary had not found the way
your sherpa wouldve never reached the peak
anyone else
which attempt of yours is this
but i wont accept defeat
im not that easy to beat
i will not rest till the goal is reached

its so confusingsir
i dont understand
maybe while you were parking
what
may be by mistake or so
brother
sir
sir
sir the scratch was caused by this
cars paint mark is also there

last night it was dark

and this has happened
i will take care of the expenses
next time be careful while parking your bike
brother
please be more careful
thats enough said
dont utter any more words
i struggle each time to park my bike in this tight space
i didnt mean that
to maneuver my bike
im requesting you to provide enough space
if i give you extra space
then how will i get down
sir we need to make some adjustments
how can you be so careless
the repair is expensive unlike your bikes repairs
the showroom will charge me a lot
it costs 300 rupees to replace a brake wire
general service costs 950 rupees
and youre talking as if its so cheap
let it gosir
i know you guys are working hard
additional effort is needed on your part
eshwar
as a senior programmer you have the responsibility
i hope you understand the situation
hmm yeah
i think its time to prove our self
sir
i felt anxious earlier today
sorry sir
sir do you consume alcohol
your question wasnt wrong brother
lets not dwell on it sir
sir do you drive a car
i drive quite well
no brother its an unnecessary luxury
cant you just buy a new bike
whats the issue with my current bike
has that bike ever started with just one kick
hmm
brother
than to spend on a new bike
why are you being so thrifty
brotherim not being thrifty
i have a daughter
i need to save for her weddingright
dont we need to spend on ourselves as well
even now
unlike you i dont have the courage to put my wife at risk
if savings arent useful to us why are they called savings
brother
today its just two of you
once your wife delivers
then you will realize the value of saving
school feescollege fees and so on will accumulate
expenses will continue to increase
the expenses will be even higher
raising her educating her her wedding expenses
and then her baby shower and delivery expenses
and then the expenses for rituals for grandchildren
what are you even talking about sir
marriages dont need to be luxuriousright
in a registrars office like you did
siri didnt mean that way
then how
i understood brother
i really did
i sat with you for drinking despite the age gap
sir
who is he to give me advice
i shouldnt have accepted his invitation
its my fate
the mixer jars blade isnt working again
what should i do now
look at the guy upstairs
see how he cares for his wife
a new jar must cost around 300 rupees right
hey
hey
have your meal ill check the door
wait ill check
yessir
please come and take your car
kindly wait for five minutessir
im not interested in your formalities
please come and move your car
please move your bike first then continue eating
please wait

hes really annoying
asking me to move the car
is he a district collector
let him wait
please check the drawer
how can i search when im leaving for college
please leave quickly
hey
sir
where is he
he just now leftsir
sir
mind your own business
sirwhat happened
release my hand please
sirplease
what is this
youre really pushing it and testing my patience
pleaselet it go
are you supporting him
be quiet i will harm you
you stay here
he pushed the bike and now hes pretending hes unaware
stay out of it
please dont act sir
today he pushed my bike and now hes acting like hes innocent
i just moved it a little
who authorized you to move my bike
who are you
what should you have done instead
i didnt want to bother you so i
you pushed itright sir
stop saying thatsir
ill park my bike wherever i want
who are you to question me
i will take care of the repair cost
if i damage your car with a stone will you accept my payment
this is how i speak
the only way to sort this out
please move your car from here
then where will i park
park it on the street
ive been here for ten years
imagine how much arrogant i could be
i pay higher rent than you do
respect can only go so far with him
who do you think you are bestowing respect upon me
ive been living here for a long time with dignity
if i speakeveryone will stand with me
im not bothered if anyone comes
i will continue parking my car here
similarly
if your bike obstructs the path
it wont fall by accident next time
i challenge you
you are crossing your limits
how dare you talk to me like that
did you think im a joke
mrparuthi
both of you have good jobs so why fight over a parking spot
with only one parking spot why not adjust and park your vehicles
ive adjusted many times and in return he made me walk on the street
sir i parked there by mistake that day
sowhat now
its not that one day sir
ever since he got the car ive been facing problems
a longhaired boy comes to wash his car
but hes peeking into my house under the pretext of it
that wont be effective tell him to park his car outside
how can i park my new car outside
sircalm down
during the floods it was the upstairs tenant who helped youright
i dont want any assistance from him
i simply need a parking space for my bike nothing more
oksir
you can use the parking area to park your bike
ill park my bike wherever i want
if you want to park your bike anywhere do it in your own house
brothercalm down
how can he park his new car on the street
so
you have to adjust because you have the bike
brother you can park your car inside
its annoying to be called for such trivial matters
hes telling me to adjust and that too in front of him
you have to adjust because you have the bike
i dont know all that sir
i want a car that costs more than eight lakhs
there are two models in your budget swift vxi and zxi
both models are available in both automatic and manual versions
if you book now you can get it in 15 to 20 days

all of this
clash of shields and swords
the sound of cannons
the clatter of road construction equipments
but i want to fight war
pilajirao careful
the king shivaji who has given swords in our hands
has also given these road construction equipments
king shivaji thinks far beyond horses swords and forts
we must take swords in our hand and also a construction tools
for whom
we should farm our lands as well as construct the forts
and who are these people
we ourselves
our king endures so much hardship for us
tanhajirao

only an unobstructed sky is visible
what brings you here
call them in the courtyard
what if they are tricksters
even if it is so
these sages have nothing to do with politics

valuable to us
and even if they are deceivers or betrayers
lets go
budhaji

and observe the work of the fort
may the dignity of self rule shine
waah
subhedar commander
you told this to our king right
but let me tell you indalkar
subhedar commander
commander tanhajirao indalkar
take this
i must leave
i must finish all the task before king comes
why did he leave so suddenly muttering to himself
once he finishes all his work before the kings arrival
once he hands over the fully constructed fort to the king
indalkar will leave from malvan
once the given task is completed he will hand it over selflessly to the king
well done indalkar
well done

yesaji
janai

sivba
the army should be refreshed
eighteen factories twelve palaces
hmm
to win the fortresses given to the enemy
because it is situated exactly opposite to rajgad
thats why king shivaji would capture kondhana first
we have to appoint a sharp
achal singh
kubaad khan
go through all the villages around kondhana fort
and make announcements in all those villages
like this
announcement pay attention everyone
announcement pay attention everyone
if anyone tries to go beyond the border and the mountain

great well now that’s confirmed come here
what in the world
it’s a bit late for that little fella the mint at least hides the stench
oh well our first paid concert and we’re not going to make it
music – food – bouncy castle
everything is possible in this country
that’s a little much don’t you think why
they should announce something right we’re going in the opposite direction
from our view it’s the forest going the wrong way
movement is an illusion
where’s the ticket inspector probably in the bathroom
there’s just some situation on the tracks
did you feel the impact it could’ve been something small
maybe a small deer in front of a combine it cowers and pretends to be invisible
or there was some obstacle on the tracks
i’m sure we could find someone
for a planned suicide this track is especially convenient
it’s a local track so you can be sure that help wouldn’t get here in time
please stop it there are kids here
no matter what it is in england they’d have removed it and the train would go on
if it’s a bigger problem the train would go back and go around it a different way
would anyone like some bread i made a bunch
well then i’d take a chicken
here you go thank you
it’s wonderful how do you make it just the normal way
bread schnitzel bread unbelievable you all really don’t care
i’m going to complain
hold up i’ll go ask sweetie will you hold this for me please
if you’re hungry get your own
everything’s fine i’ll find out what’s going on
in every horror when the door closes behind someone all by itself…
hello mr engineer i don’t want to frighten you i’m talking now
this is roman hála a driving school instructor
why are we going backwards
do you want to try and open it
if he’d wanted he’d have answered maybe something happened to him
like a heart attack while driving
it just happened to a bus driver in napajedla
fortunately a passenger behind him saw it and jumped with his hands on the pedals
that was my dad
the driver not the rescuer
he’s alive
maybe he had a micro nap
you really didn’t try the handle i didn’t want to seem so dramatic
maybe he left something at home and is going back for it keys perhaps
or a bee stung him and he’s having an allergic reaction
fifteen percent of the population have severe allergic reactions to bee stings
a cramp or he’s diabetic
he locked himself in
or he’s not strong enough to unlock it then we have to kick it in
if he’s not dead already he’s not
so i’ll shoot the lock open
maybe he’s on the phone i’d have heard that through the door
what if he’s listening to music with headphones
or he’s deaf or dumb or shy
how mommy i don’t know we’ll crash into something
this is the only train that runs on these tracks twice a day
so maybe we’ll crash into the other one
einstein would disagree with you
plus this is the afternoon one so this one isn’t going back
i want to pull the emergency brake you haven’t thought this out completely
this is an emergency brake and we want to brake and save ourselves
i’m not a complete cunt am i read what’s written here
pull this handle in cases of danger
well this would be danger wouldn’t it read on
misuse will be punished
state companies
what’s going on here
maybe… a kidnapping
or us or us in the train why would anyone do that
i don’t know it’s always about money
hey boys shut your traps ok let us grownups figure it out
revenge it’s a strong motivator
yes we’re speeding out of control on a regional train at 5kmhr to our doom
exactly sweetie…
listen does anyone here know the engineer
don’t waste our time we can’t be shy right now
roman are you serious
well i know kamila here a bit be quiet please
i said be quiet
i also made out with kamila in kácov mommy
it’s ok you were already married
and arranged that all of us are going together right now
sofie with sofie’s mom how dare you
there they also try to get into the cabin but it is based on a true story
september 11th
young man that’s it they laid something on the tracks
the engineer stopped he got out and they liquidated him then sent it backwards
maybe they took his uniform as a disguise
radical muslims between kolešovice and chrášťany on a friday afternoon
let’s leave it to professionals excuse me does anyone have a phone
my wife and i leave our phones at home when we trail walking
i have one
to the cabin before it’s too late wait little guy do you have a phone
i don’t own a phone i’ve got nobody to call
mine was stolen they left just the case so…
mine burnt up yesterday the battery exploded
i know it almost never happens but it happened to me
i haven’t got any credit no credit is needed for emergency calls
i’ve got really bad signal for emergency calls one bar is enough
fine… i sold it in the pawn shop
sorry guys i was embarrassed to tell you
i’ve got one ok fine i wanted to call the boys to tell them i’d be late anyways
because if it rang on accident you might shoot a friend in the head it’s happened
to a colleague
shit what is it pin
no the code i’m so bad with numbers
how about date of birth that’s possible or date of death
that’s not it
i’d guess 1235 you think
oh it’s the number that i…
puk what’s puk do i play hockey
you probably had too many attempts here’s mine but just a short call ok
mom not now ok
mom
leave it to me
they’ve all been stolen why would they do that
for traditional pig roasts… probably
they say it’s the best quick death painless
alright let’s go
are you coming
are you coming of course i am
can you smell it too
a kind of musty smell you can smell death in the air
and a boy in a small unventilated space step back
shit it always misfires when i need it
always when you want to shoot right
this one’s old it’s just my backup why don’t you have your nonbackup
use the rifle butt i’m not stupid it’d smash into pieces
don’t you want to shoot from the side what if he’s still alive
fine
the bastard detonated
i dropped my drumsticks where’s the door handle
it’s on fire
get out get out
the bastard detonated
what happened
he bumped the fire extinguisher uhl254 it’s standard equipment in every train
you knocked off activating upon impact
the angel of death
sofie it’s the parrot from the mall
hi
what were you doing in the bathroom i… i was robbed what
i was robbed at the shopping center at what center
the shopping center i was embarrassed
tissue
anyone got a tissue i do
do you want a hard candy sugar calms you down it raises the glucose level
thank you
i have a parttime job at the mall
i called my parents to pick me up but i just got their voicemail
so i locked myself right away in the bathroom
do you think we’re going to believe that calm down do you have any proof
i do
alright wait so you have a phone
sofie
don’t move little girl don’t be scared sofie nothing’s wrong
i’m thirsty
that’s the second phone you’ve destroyed today that’s quite a feat little girl
alright let’s summarize we’ve no connection to the outside world
we don’t know why we’re going backwards what happened to the engineer
alright second attempt on the front line
we got your message we’re coming for you mom
we’re practically on the way dad
hey someone shot out the window
that was you
the train is going so slow we could jump out
well maybe not
i was afraid it was a fire extinguisher you see people aren’t so bad
yea they left it there give it to me
hold this no not you i don’t want to search for it in some pawn shop you
mom i’m thirsty
would you give my daughter a drink
she’s thirsty
this is unbelievable so selfish in these situations that’s really harsh
tough luck nobody will give you anything
you’d just want to pee after then you’d be thirsty again it’s never ending
could i have a praline
don’t be so hysterical here you go
more like gypsy kid i said it was cardboard
give that to me
miss
hello hello
phone
that bastard turned it on and jumped out the window
it’s just a digital clock it’s counting down forwards
a phone someone’s hidden a phone
you can’t smell it on your breath and you
when we got on it was already hanging there
what happened to you roman we’re at war
mr karajvanov owns a funeral service he knows how to work with dead bodies
this grandpa is only sleeping sleep is simulating death
so search him my dad believed that when we’re asleep
hm people believe so much different shit nothing against your father
but this man would’ve already built a skyscraper he’s slept the whole way
what
i don’t need a ticket
i’m retired
i’m mr karajvanov from the funeral service
i’m going to speak… to the scouts
what’s on the chain
it’s a button sos assistance services for the elderly
there now they know about us there’s no batteries
i wear it because of the kids…
and grandkids
and great grandkids…
and great great grandkids
unbelievable isn’t it yea
it’s coming from the other cabin
if we expect that the train driver was driving the train from the cabin
which was in the forward direction before we started going backwards
this theory would be supported by the fact that the cabin you just destroyed
was locked and unused in the time when we were going in the right direction
thanks sweetie but leave it to us
could i have another praline of course of course
how long have you all been together i… i don’t even know
roman is my second husband
hopefully the third time’s a charm
and i’ve been looking really hard
men are like a russian babushka doll
let me say this a good man is a dead man it’s the same with communists
they’re faithful partners for their whole lives
which is usually around 80 years
if we’re speaking about the macaw
wait are you sure
you’re right there’s not enough space
i’m gonna kill you why don’t you answer my calls
i’m not going to make the opening act now
i’m writing you up i’m closing now bye
bye
hello for repeatedly not paying your balance
your sim card has been blocked
in order to unblock it contact customer service
hello this is roman hála driving school instructor
thank you roman hála
alright help is on the way
in movies it’s enough to just swallow the sim card
alright listen up two updates and only one of them is bad
jesus christ
you can’t run from death
the phone was immediately destroyed after use
oh
what now
now we wait for what
for the help sweetie
oh of course
it looks really nice in color a real honest look it gives me shivers
what about the text “certainty is certainty” means nothing
it seemed better than “secure security”
i’m serious
neither do i
now it makes sense you think so
but we were already in office before weren’t we
i’ll cross it out
and why normality
now
now
now that’s pretty good
change potential
three letters and it says just everything
so give a kidney
a friend of mine has given three already
but we should probably look at this
we aren’t going backwards
what’s this it doesn’t matter what it is
what’s important is that you’re on it it’s the train from the last campaign
it’s in our region where’d you get this
and where’d she find it on the internet
excuse me you say nobody’s driving the train so how’s it going
why are you all asking me i don’t know
oh no it’s true you can’t here the engine
that’s actually true maybe it’s an electric train
but going the other way it was normal
maybe it’s both a hybrid train
i want out i’m getting out can i go with you mommy
while moving the doors are automatically locked for the safety of the passengers
the engineer got out we didn’t notice it and he was trying to fix it
oh please you watch too many movies
alright there’s a man with a gun
a broken window a group of hostages
and someone perhaps the train driver running after the train
it might be a movie filming or railway emergency training situations
terrorism
excuse me should i make some coffee this is too big for us calm down
we have to call for a crisis task force call a crisis task force meeting
who’s going to be in it for now the three of us and you
i have afternoon pilates
pissing to the left huh you know it
hey look at that
they’re here they’re coming for us already
the police police
here here
some kind of entertainers
probably already campaigning they really must be all out of ideas
they’re already quite drunk sure are
so just honk at them
police
police
or there will be another patrol car they’ll definitely send someone
it’ll take a while so we’re just going to wait until we die
and i’ve got my daughter here i’m thirsty so cross your legs
i want to go home
great so i wouldn’t drag in the railway authorities
i don’t know
and is there one where they came from
probably not anymore it’s friday afternoon jirka
15 minutes ago so the train was still on the tracks
when it should’ve already been at the station something was holding it up
yea and what if it’s not who’s going to take responsibility for it you
can we find out who’s the idiot with the shotgun or put a listening device there
but maybe because of that now i should say something
but resignation is not a solution
to give up that’s easy
i could’ve done that 1000 times in my life
you’re a naturalborn leader isn’t he boys
and you too and definitely you too
so which one of you knows how to drive a train
don’t look at me they took my papers from me in driving school dui
but you’re an instructor aren’t you a car isn’t a train
roman clutch gas clutch gas look here don’t make us butter you up
the boy can give you advice if needed
you’re all just like my father i don’t know why i should handle it all the time
babusha doll
i’m not sleeping will you save us
there’s nothing to fear
alright
the people nicknamed it zucchini orchestrion or runaway suitcase
automatic hydromechanical transmission praga 2…
brakes automatic pressure
controlled by two air brakes momentarily they are not working
alright
and all its commanders
this would never happen to me in a plane
turn around what
allahu akbar
what
allahu akbar what did you say
it means god is great why are you saying it
friend i knew it the whole time
you’ve been in on this from the start what
no terrorist attack is successful without the help of someone on the inside
you went first into the cabin to signal to them
when you search the internet long enough you snap
better she’s afraid now than for her to carved up like puzzle pieces later
the story takes place in the year 2022
from the muslim brotherhood party mohammed benabbes
so anyone else who doesn’t believe me
i’m surprised he hasn’t cut off our heads yet how many of you are already here
to the east so you’re a muslim
what is this
this don’t make a fool of me
the kitbag it’s just a backpack
and no funny business roman don’t let him fuck with you
mortal combat
first for misusing the emergency brake bac was 25 and was fined 2 million
fuck and not one working phone on the line
so they couldn’t be located a professional we have to do something
if we do nothing and something happens someone’s going to be investigated
and someone else will do time i have a family
i know jirka get ahold of yourself
so uooz you mean ncoz send the emergency services unit
there’s still the election and here you have prime time practically for free
what should i tell them i know nothing we have to think of something
so you actually say nothing
mr mayor are you at your cottage
still at work
not for long though my display is a bit broken
hold on… jaruna has the train from kolešovice arrived
i don’t know
we don’t know
i don’t know 200 meters right
the train station yea
there are people here
a train is speeding down here with no driver it’s apparently on fire
we’re coming
no funny business i said no funny business
are you going to shoot the backpack quiet woman
now we need someone who will look inside
usually they send a specialist in a protective suit
what did i tell you is there nothing else there
alright
who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
give us this day our daily bread…
and lead us not into temptation
amen

has anyone got a smart phone with video
stop now stop put it right there
alright
you all will come in handy
hey technicians on the tracks
civilians take cover and gunmen take your position
you also take cover little girl
breaking news
the video which today went viral on social networks is not just an internet joke
why is nobody driving the train what happened on this train line
and who is running behind the train the regional representative will attempt
to answer these questions about the emergency situation that has transpired
hello mr representative
can you hear me
try perhaps moving around a bit for a better signal
the crisis task force is working nonstop sometimes even more
alright that’s enough
but we have information that we are in touch with the author of the video
author of video i didn’t want a viral clip i’m no hero
we were sucked into a black hole…
the truth however is that our behavior our intentions desires and choices
and over them we haven’t the slightest control
because all reality is served to us from the darkness of our skulls…
what so she had a small sip
an ashy smoothie
have you seen house of cards no
there the actor becomes the president of the usa do you know how

roman you lied it’s not as simple as that sweetie
i really wanted to tell you the truth
but before i finished i believed it
i’m waiting to be rescued
the outside world doesn’t know about us

agh
excuse me
we spilled some tea
are you alright

please enjoy
thanks
what were you saying
well
im really sorry about this yuri makoto
in other words we
are treated as wage slaves
why not work part time
we all do the same job right killing
yeah whats the difference
i agree
even though i agree
but this is how reality is
its awful
mr akagi
what im going to say theyre just rumors
i heard there are more and more wage slaves like you
but there are very few full time assassins
yeah so
the quality is different from that of the wage slaves
well then what
if you kill them the position will be open
youve been doing this for so long
if you can join the organization you can move up
you must assassinate the assassin to go full time
wow thats way too risky right
right brother
fuck em up i knew youd say that
knock em down
well then mr akagi
hell yeah
i see
its these two
chisato sugimoto
mahiro fukugawa
chisato sugimoto
mahiro fukagawa

excellent
so so
that was five years ago right

now theyve sent a reminder
what what what
389 million
thats too expensive
good morning
good morning
eh mr susano
did you read the email
is there something like a trial period
not possible
huh
you ignored them so its on you
it turns out
you expect us to pay membership dues for four years
so
they sent bills every month
its your fault you threw them away
misato call the customer complaint line
ill do it
dont do that
and
our association has happy assassin insurance
the two of you should join
what is happy assassin insurance
if the insured person is over 18 itll change automatically
what is he talking about

ah so annoying
my savings get smaller everyday
thats because you failed so many times

tongue
the kind who shows off to others
uh
eh
when the supermarket has rice balls on sale for 100 yen
um
at this time
that kind of person would definitely get a sausage rice ball
a silly looking ball filled with mayonnaise
nope
but it is true
when supermarket rice balls were on sale
do they not care about special offers
cause salt rice balls are always 100 yen
its true i feel numb to life
people who are indifferent to anything
ah
you call someone crazy just cause of a rice ball
eh

lets agree on splitting the work like this
dont break formation
what formation its just two people
hey
of course
the association wont support you either
yeah
for example
its impossible to take the case secretly without going through the association
taking the case secretly
doesnt every killer operate in secret
thats right
in short
like that previous maid cafe incident that turned into a protest
and never take action to kill people
i know
are you okay

while the day lingers
lets enjoy a nice walk
from now on
none of us can hear
you do it so well
its so big
but we cant leave the shop
no its fine
thanks to you im visiting here you say its famous
yes the inside is worth seeing
really
maybe it will appear in one of your works
but it looks like that comic book robot
right
take care thanks for the sign language
thanks for today you came so far
lets meet again soon
lets do that
bye
i dont take taxis i came on the subway
 ill in touch  wait
but ive always respected your work
thank you
what are you looking at so intently
its been so long
where did we meet before
you dont recognize me
director park
director parks wife thats right
director parks hiding over there
ill bring him over okay
i guess hes hesitant to meet you
it seems like fate meeting you here
yes
ill bring him over
hes just innocent thats all
what brings you here
here on some business
its my first time here too
we stopped on the way back from paldang
i thought maybe i could use it in a film someday
i see
youre exactly the same you look good
you still have that charisma
what charisma
you really do have charisma truly
 i have charisma  ask around everyone thinks so
i dont have charisma and you do
all right thank you
so you came to meet your friend
yes but
why did you hide
you hid from me
yes it was urgent
oh my
 what are you writing these days  this and that
turn left
its nice here right
okay
critics say so too but i can sense it myself
wait i should try these
but whats gotten clear
but i do think something changed my attitude toward filmmaking
really
compulsion isnt necessarily a bad thing for someone like me
so at first i worried id get too relaxed
but it was okay
for sure
before i thought my life was shit so i just focused on filmmaking
life is so hard to fix anyway
but my thinking changed
so increase your satisfaction with life
then you wont break down later
now that youre old you just want to be comfortable
that could be it right
since youre successful now
you must be quite rich
everyones just trying their best life isnt easy
are you still angry about what happened before
no being angry wont change anything
i wasnt wanted thats all
right it wasnt me it was their decision
ive got no power the investor is top dog
theyre the ones who turned it down
top dog
then you shouldve shot it
but there was nothing i could do
no you wanted too much
shoot your film make money become famous
no i dont want that much
really i only barely manage to get my films made thats all
turn it to focus
wait hold it here and if you turn this ring
it will focus
its an expensive lens very bright
maybe hes looking at womens legs
what are you talking about
thats ridiculous
here
lots of people there
its gotten warm right
its spring now almost
yes its a perfect day to walk outside
it smells like spring here
yes youre right
we came once before and it was nice no people
its relaxing to get away from seoul no crowds
itd be nice to live here
that walking path we saw from above
that leads to here
i think so it didnt branch off anywhere
anyway thanks for walking with me
right weve just been driving itll be nice to walk
great
youre right shes here
of course
yes thats her
hyojin
kilsoo
you were out walking you must live nearby
yes near here
hello youre a novelist right
you recognize me
yes im a fan
of your books
nice to meet you what brings you here
director park drove me i said i wanted to walk
good choice this park is very quiet
nice to meet you i live with director park
you live together
 yes weve lived together a while  for how long
around that including when we dated
 you know each other well  we met for business once
but not that well right
yes about an hour walking quickly
but you arent acting i havent heard any news
its been a while
no im not acting
you should
well i shot a few independent films by some acquaintances
 but now ive stopped  dont you want to
its such a waste
why dont you want to
you think
why no directors you want to work with
you must receive screenplays you have a lot of fans
whats a waste
you think she doesnt know anything
everyone chooses the life they want you think shes a child
a waste you know what that word implies
how can you say that to a grown person
shes not in elementary school
do you love her life more than she does
everyone wants to realize their life in their own way
not everyone cares about money
you should acknowledge that
its a waste because we value her shes still young
shes young but shes not using her talent
but what is she wasting exactly
would that satisfy you
life is so short you shouldnt miss your chance
everyone has their time
you know that old saying dont waste your chance
dont waste your breath
waste your breath
waste
honey i think wed better go
 no walk  next time
thank you
see you later
im sorry for shouting
 okay  okay
im sorry for shouting
youve got great charisma
really
you have charisma
if you say so
can you smell anything on me
no do you smell something
really my husband too
i slept late mustve been tired
youre always late
of course hello
nice to meet you
my husbands nephew
his names gyeongwoo i see
so you come here often
walking really quickly makes me feel great
i like walking fast
thank you
so you live nearby
the maintenance fees were too high
maintaining a house is really expensive
and its cold
hes majoring in film
 whats your school again  knua
 really  sure lets talk film
hes really smart despite his looks
dont embarrass me
yes thats right
did you walk here too
then you know how to use a camera
yes sometimes i shoot my own work i know the basics
lets go together i need the restroom
really great
its that way
you waited long
we were talking inside so it took a while
thats fine
she wants to shoot a short film with us
really
really with uncle a short film
ive always wanted to shoot a film
a lifetime dream i guess
of course she has to agree
but if you can spare a day or two
right me too
you thought of it today after meeting kilsoo
but thats a precondition for this project
it has to be someone i really like
no i really mean it
youre really great
thank you
thank you gyeongwoo
you two are comfortable together right
but i think you can shoot it
yes i see
all of the elements have to converge
observe and feel with my heart
and shes put in her most comfortable state
then the camera
will capture whatever emerges from her at that time
so the person this actor meets in the film
has to be someone she connects with
who she feels a deep emotion for
all the feelings glances and gestures between
i want to capture that with the camera
so everything has to be comfortable everything has to be real
so thats your idea
what i want to shoot isnt a documentary
whatever it turns out to be
but what do you think gyeongwoo
but i really want to try this just once
im curious about what youll make
and if my uncle and aunt take part
what do you think
as for me
since i love your work so much
anyway it should be interesting
no it should be fun
itd be great if he would
of course
since hes an artist too perhaps
of course
sure snacks should be okay its a park after all
you can smell that
yes i can smell well
like a blodbound
really
her eyes too like a hawk
im amazed i cant smell a thing
id like ramen
whenever i think of ramen i want to eat a bowl
but isnt this path nice itd be good to shoot here
of course
thanks so much
bye
want some tteokbokki after this
ill eat this first
its flourbased is that okay
i like flour tteokbokki better
me too
you must be feeling some doubt
what does a novelist know about film
im glad
 theres a school playground  yes
seems like a good day for drinking
 you feel like drinking  a bit
do you drink alcohol
i like to but ive stopped
i like makkeolli a lot wine too
i like makkeolli too
ive written many novels very many
yes
i guess ive lost the strength to write
really
of course i can force myself ive done it all my life
and something new might come out of it
sure
you cant find the energy
but now my writing feels exaggerated
i can feel myself exaggerating
like i have to keep inflating small things into something meaningful
thats a big burden and frankly its embarrassing
i see
a kind of privilege even
and i believed in everything i felt so it was okay
but i dont feel that way anymore
it all feels exaggerated
but then i just stopped
well see what happens
you really should rest for me it helps a lot
you seem so honest
look at her
yes she really was staring at you
really so cute
what a cute kid
kilsoo
two people who planned to come cant make it
but werent they the ones who invited him
hell arrive in 30 minutes
okay im nearby so i can at least stop in
but it will be 30 minutes before i can go
okay thats fine
want me to bring tteokbokki im at strawberrys
well be drinking makkeolli so that should go well with it
thank you
someone i know needs me for something
we can meet again
shes so friendly shes older than me
she seems very educated very sensitive i like her
should i join you then
i just like spending time with you
great shall we drink theyre having makkeolli there
can i have 3 portions of tteokbokki
okay
this bookstore
yes
really
its fine well just tell her what happened
right
hi
she already drank a lot
ive seen your films you were really great
thank you
want some more
really i thought you knew each other well
we may shoot a film together
she wants to shoot a short film with me
but you two just met in the tower
its amazing
todays been one of those days
a really strange day meeting all these people i know
youre right
of course we do
right
i couldnt say this before
dont be silly
its true i have all your poetry books every one
really thank you thats pretty rare
im so honored
it tastes great today
you havent published anything recently have you
me
well maybe im all done
why do you think
who knows you can never know that kind of thing
still dont give up you have talent
me
if i drink i can write drink some more write some more
you have your alcohol
why live long whats the point
well my doctors say i should stop drinking
doctors always say that
but you have so much talent
 youre blessed  me
and youll shoot a film with me soon
i told you we were drinking buddies
i never imagined you two were close
how could you we never told you
right
okay
youre so impressive
you are even more impressive
thank you
sir youre an impressive man too
thank you
this is so nice
people need to drink once in a while
me too really
im happy too another drink
another drink
ill get a bottle wait were all out
its okay to drink what do doctors know
right
it was so nice when we drank together
that was long ago
but youve gotten old
of course soon ill be 70
really i guess so
why ask that no need to tell everyone
really
ms kim about our film
right junhee
thats a bit much
i havent decided the story yet
if your husband agrees then ill think of one
why
seeing you right now
i just thought of a story
you did
whats the story
no dont dont say anything
this is mine dont
okay
dont spoil it just dont say anything okay
 you always spoil things  okay then
no kilsoo
if your husband agrees ill write the story
but the story isnt so important
the storys not that important
a birthday for example
we could make a story out of that
so you quarrel and then you get really angry
then your husband arrives there as if nothing had happened
even this kind of story can be used
 sounds interesting  really
i like that story
because that really happened to us
and then what
thats it for now
isnt it too offhand dont you need something to pull people in
ill do that later
i like it because it really happened
so i really like it
thats great
no a story needs plot
thats what we expect from a storyteller
another drink
sure thanks
she and her husband agreed not to
why
though she likes it
should we call her husband
but were you and the poet really close
hes lost his fire used to be scary to see him drink
no he was scary back then
hes gotten old
did anything happen between you two
what could happen
its surprising
we slept together once after drinking thats all
i see
but he kept calling me afterwards
after that we didnt meet often it got uncomfortable
yes he is sensitive
right
dont go tell anyone
dont worry
for his sake at least
okay
have some more
thanks
what story did you think of before
you said you thought of a story for kilsoo
i cant remember
really
i forget those things right away
its like smoke
youre so healthy
thank you
she sleeps anywhere doesnt she
i see
thats good
no

access road no standing cars
yeoju correctional system
they say a lawyer advocates
defends and protects people
until i took this case
case record sung yoonah homicide
im lee jungmin your public defender
im fine
yes i have
i dont have much to say
its just as it says
but as your lawyer i need to hear the story firsthand
i just want the trial to end
ms sung
so i need you to tell me everything
mr lee
i did it
i dont believe youre guilty
ms sung
this trial isnt about you
do you think its you who should be on trial
it should be the man who did this to you
so take your time and tell me
right
so which is it
your initial denial or your confession later
your confession aside why couldnt the police find the sealant
mr lee
i really did it
i regret it all
so tell that to the court
thank you for coming
ms sung
korea legal aid corporation yeoju branch
oh wow
lets see so…
and she poured sealant over his mouth and nose
crime scene investigation police
hey make sure you dont lose that woman
the husband was a businessman seems like he was quite wealthy
he had a considerably large inheritance and multiple life insurance policies
she confessed right
then when the police obtained her journal she confessed
her journal
yes she made notes about her plan
she wrote things like how much dosage would be lethal written like daily diary
well then…
shes not getting away with it
this journal…
man those people…
the guys at the homicide unit dont exactly do things by the book so…
did they rummage through stuff and just take the journal
is it a public attorneys job to nitpick about how cops work
i still have to do my job
wow
yeah
its nice to get on her good side
especially in a small town with only one criminal division
mr hwang
yeah
thank you
sender name havana
mr lee
be easy on yourself and go with the good character defense
she volunteered a lot at church
or she might be catholic
anyway whats this
havana
i didnt think youd come
why not
i told you i have nothing more to say
i still have some questions
ms sung
are you catholic
sorry
someone sent this to me
do you know someone named havana
no i dont
the holy bible
can you open it
to the page with the bookmark
i think its a message for you
ms sung put your hand on the bible and tell me
put your hand on the bible and tell me again…
that you did it
that will determine how i present the case
but what about minji
a child needs her mother
you need to be with her

all rise
first date of trial
sung yoonah your honor
prosecution please state the charge
yes your honor
prosecution
the defendant and the victim her husband lee sungjin had marital issues
as the victims assaults continued the defendant decided to murder him
at around 2 am on august 21 2021 at the victims home
the defendant took a lethal dose of propofol which she had obtained
and injected it into the victims right arm
once the injection was complete
legal counsel
no your honor
in fact she is the victim of her husbands habitual abuse
defendant do you agree with your counselor
defendant
yes
yes your honor
very well
then lets look further into evidence
legal counsel defendant
your honor
first we deny the admissibility of the police report
same for the prosecutors report
we agree to the autopsy report
we admit that the confiscated journal belongs to the defendant
but we do not agree to its admissibility
hold on
the defendant was under duress during the entire interrogation
any further evidence from prosecution
all right
next time we convene well first examine lead officer kim
ms sung
you did great
thank you
mr lee
yes
of course
please let minji know that im doing fine
first grade class 2 lee minji
thank you for coming all this way
my pleasure
so you like drawing minji
im your moms friend im helping her with something
you doing okay with grandma
a face
i see
hey sooah where are you
ill let you choose
its my duty as a citizen before im a journalist
you were sad for the stray cats too
did you meet the kid
i did
but that woman…
maybe shes still putting on a show
like those rumors online
think about it
basically shell get it all
dont tell me its because she looks like a nice person
i think shes hiding something from me
she couldve been forced to give false testimony under duress
what footage
and i saw this
what is this
sir are you a homicide detective at yeoju police station
thats right
yes
second date of trial
we found this while searching the property
so i immediately seized it as evidence
no i believe it was given by voluntary submission
for that to happen you need the owners consent
yes i did
how
no not really
mr lee i dont think you know how it works in the field
but im talking about the law
on august 29 2021 you testified to the prosecution that a crime reenactment
yes she volunteered to participate
your honor a passerby recorded the scene that day
may i publish it to the court
go ahead
push her i said closer
you poured it on his face hey
how did you dispose of it
come on you mustve hidden it somewhere
that to me doesnt seem voluntary at all
wouldnt you agree
this was only a part of the process overall it was fine
it was fine
so has this been the norm for police investigations
mr lee
counsel will that be all
witness
ms sung
yes
during interrogations your statement changed a bit
please tell the truth here today
yes
in the morning of your husband lee sungjins murder
you were arrested and interrogated correct
yes
i said we both used propofol and fell asleep
and when i woke up in the morning he was dead
yes
when i woke up…
i couldnt bear staying at home
why not
could you be more specific
i was scared
scared of what
i felt if i stayed…
thats what i was scared of
what happened on that night before you used propofol
are these bruises from the abuse that night
yes
what happened next
then…
were you sexually assaulted
yes
yes
you found him dead correct
yes
so its possible that there was an intruder
while you were away
no further questions
mr kim any questions for the defendant
just a couple of questions
defendant
you stated that you both used propofol and fell asleep
then you woke up first correct
no i didnt
then who did it
according to the police report there was no sign of intrusion
youre saying the victim gave himself a lethal dose of propofol
objection your honor in the august 25 police report
this is without factual evidence
mr kims question is leading and calls for speculation
denied lets hear what the defendant has to say
i cant say for sure
but its true that he had been increasing the dosage
i see
mr kim any more questions
thank you ms sung
mr lee
yes mr kim
why are you working so hard
its my job
but you do know what happened right
she clearly did it
come on why does that matter we all know what really happened
mr kim
dont you want to become a prosecutor
working hard is good
mr kim im the defense attorney on this case
so
seems like the prosecution made a few mistakes with this case
i think i want to correct them
all right
if thats what you want
yeoju correctional institution
you look awful
what brings you here
but we only have 20 minutes so…
i plan to tell the truth from now on
come on
fine
i was thinking about testifying in your favor
i feel bad for the deceased but…
hes my brother but i felt sorry for my sisterinlaw
she had every reason to do it
im being sincere
so you want me to admit to it
yoonah dont get too greedy
if i say that youll have no problem getting probation
really why are you here
in return id like you to give up your custody of minji
you havent changed one bit
i filed a petition yesterday…
so i can get custody of minji
they wont let a murderer take care of a child
hey
dont act like the victim
you wanted him dead too
not as much as you
id consider my offer if i were you
yoonah where were you
fresh air
whered you get fresh air
with whom
why you
tell me
tell me
mom
inmate 4688 what is it
calm down
4688
what happened
whats this about who did this to you
excuse me
why is she handcuffed
shes on a special watch
for what
your sisterinlaw lee jiyoung
she wants to take minji from me
what
she want custody of minji
explain it to me in detail
she filed a petition for child custody
she will do anything to take minji away from me
no matter what it takes
ms sung
lets focus on the trial for now
the only witness have left is jiyoung whom we can handle
no one can take minji away from you
trust me and lets focus on the trial
okay
and they searched your house again
no there isnt
you couldnt tell which color it was couldnt tell no
this is sung yoonahs car entering the park by the river
correct
it looked like they were hugging
witness
the defendant was wearing this coat that day
we issued a warrant and obtained it from her house
sir is this the coat you saw
yes thats right
then she got in the car hugged the driver…
did she kiss the driver
well…
i didnt feel like i had to know
the plate number or a car model
not sure about the plate number
but i think it was a white sedan…
it may have been an audi
your honor by circumstantial evidence the defendant was out that night
now we must ask
whether she acted alone or with the help of an accomplice
your honor this is all but speculation
we cannot amend the indictment with a conspiracy charge
based purely on speculation
for now lets conclude the direct examination
does the prosecution wish to continue
counsel would you like to crossexamine
yes your honor
just a few questions
sir
you first testified to the prosecution
more than two months after the incident correct
yes i spoke to them last week
yes i remember clearly
even though she is a complete stranger to you
it mustve been quite dark at the time
but i know what i saw
hes telling the truth
the thing is ive seen one of ms sungs movies
no further questions
your honor the witness testimony today
revealed that the defendant met someone on the night of the crime
the defendant refuses to answer thats
the rendezvous is a private matter and has no relevance to this case
im not sure i understand
if she didnt conspire with him why cant she reveal who he is
ms choi this case is getting interesting
it is
the defense has significantly lost credibility
i suppose
is her lover the accomplice
yes maam
beware of surroundings
propofol
no hope despair regret
just when i thought it was all over
like a miracle someone walked into my life
the book well be discussing today is virginia woolfs mrs dalloway
its original title was the hours which essentially means time
woolf later wrote another novel called the years meaning the passage of time
lets talk more about the author herself
before her death she wrote the last letter to her lover
always the hours between us
always the love
like a miracle someone walked into my life
so there was someone
how could she hide it from you
i did
she said shed rather fire me than tell me
shes got some nerve
at this rate acquittal is pretty unlikely
just saying its a possibility you know what
come on dont give up just yet
if you stay persistent with this case
youll definitely get the attention of the top brass
from the countryside get a chance to become a prosecutor in seoul no way
yeah jungmin lets aim for seoul
sender korean nurses association
recipient lee jiyoung
looks like she euthanizes dogs
who on earth would send us this stuff
must be havana
wait a sec
what about the person who showed you that video on facebook
can i see their page
sure hold on
their accounts gone
no search results
but are we sure we can trust this source
we can check it out ourselves
my dog ruby
yes im here
okay
ruby
you have to bring her back safely
dont worry
be gentle
still be careful
i got this
sorry for calling you so late
you said you found me online
yes
did you bring cash
please sit down
she looks quite young
she gets that a lot
you must have a cold i do
she wont feel a thing right
no dont worry
is that propofol
yes thats right
the same thing we use on people
so do you give it to people too
are you really here for your puppy
give her to me
ive had her for 12 years
let me think it over for another day
stop
even for yourself
shes coming
ruby ruby my baby ruby oh dear
youre sweating
you okay what happened
my heart hold on
what
it went well you owe me
you know that woman offered me a shot too
what
thats more than what we bargained for
seriously
were all set lets go
off we go
i swear to tell the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
and if i testify falsely under oath i shall be punished for perjury
ms lee are you the victim lee sungjins sister and the defendants sisterinlaw
yes thats right
how was the victims relationship with the defendant before his passing
mr kim
may i first say something to the judge
ms lee please answer my questions first
you see im devastated…
for my brother
for my late brothers sake i want to raise minji myself
thats why i filed for custody
what was the victims relationship with the defendant like before he passed
before my brother died he told me several times that he was scared
scared of what
of the defendant
but she would hit him back and raise hell each time
objection your honor
that question is leading
very well
ms lee earlier you had described how intense their fights were
what would they argue about
he said…
another man
yes
that she was plotting something
thats right
he was afraid for his life
no further questions
during your direct examination
you said you had filed custody of the defendants daughter
i did
you have your own children but you want to be her legal guardian as well
thats right
were you always so concerned about your niece
yes of course
if she is found guilty of homicide
the defendant will lose the right of inheritance
then all of lee sungjins inheritance would go to their daughter minji
are you aware of that
and is badgering the witness
no your honor these questions are relevant to possible motives
understood your honor
let me rephrase
if the defendant is found guilty youd become your niece minjis legal guardian
and be able to manage the wealth correct
i cant let a murderer raise her can i
according to the defendant
last fall you asked the victim to loan your husband some money for his business
is this true
no its not
thats nonsense
that woman made it all up
the records show that before the victims death you called
why did you do that
ms lee
you once worked as a registered nurse correct
yes and
youve injected propofol before yes
how can he be so insulting to the victims family
objection your honor defense is asking questions irrelevant to the case
no your honor
she had been regularly supplying psychotropic drugs to the victim
ms lee you supply propofol for humans too dont you
that would mean your main clientele isnt just pets
but people who want propofol for themselves correct
if he continues this way i will refuse to speak
i never did such a thing ms lee
mr lee
thatll be all
yes your honor no further questions
your honor defense would like to submit into evidence a transcript
of ms lees conversation with a client while preparing to euthanize a pet
we dont know whos speaking in the recording
theres a great possibility that it was fabricated prosecution objects
ill also submit the audio recording separately if necessary
for now the court will delay the decision on the admissibility of the evidence
counsel
im all right judge
it doesnt matter im just doing my job
ms choi can you keep a secret
i hope you didnt wiretap anyone
no i didnt
even if i allow it as evidence it doesnt prove her innocence
if lee jiyoung was the supplier
she couldve snuck in and murdered him that night
thats possible but…
for now all you can prove is that she may have been his supplier
such evidence wont hold up in a higher court
do you really believe everything your client is saying
i believe shes innocent
im sure she has her reasons for hiding it
but ill find out
i see
but is that really what she wants
if she wishes to hide the truth
only knowing the truth will allow me to help her
fine
were you watching cartoons
yes
you like that show
yes
grandma went out for a second
can we turn off the tv
minji youre so smart and clever
minji you miss your mom a lot huh
you dont miss her
yes i miss her
im sure you do you must miss her very much
nothing
what what didnt you see
i didnt see anything
minji you gotta think hard
i didnt see anything
minji i saw nothing i saw nothing
hows minji
her fevers gone down
what happened
her aunt came by this afternoon

mr lee

mr lee

of course
youll see her soon
who will come
of course
all right
thank you
hello
yes
your coffee sir
do you know ms sung yoonah
she comes here often
what
you can send faxes here right
yes we have a fax machine we can help you with that
but how do you know yoonah
were just friends
the weathers gotten warmer
yes
its been over three months already
i hope minji wont look at me like a stranger
ms sung
what
according to prosecution minji saw something that day
shes their principal witness shes not even eight yet she cant
why does that matter
was he the person you met
did minji see that man
tell me if im wrong
i did it
ms sung
what are you doing
no i did it
ms sung dont do this
please go mr lee
im trying to help you
i said just go
ms sung
youre trying to help me
no one can help us
however beneath her lies there was sincerity
legal counsel  defendant
all rise
fifth date of trial
you may be seated
prosecution did you apply to call a witness
your honor i call lee minji the defendants daughter to the stand
counsel do you agree
dont worry
defense would also to call a witness to the stand
the witness is present here today
so with your ruling ill examine the witness right away
objection your honor
we dont even know who it is
you asked the defendant to reveal whom she met in the car
that person is here in this court
choi eunjoo the presiding judge of this court
mr lee what is this nonsense
to further this case by proper procedure the court will go into recess
all rise
as the chief of this judicial branch i will now preside over this case
counsel would you like to call a new witness
this is quite unusual
as you know you may be convicted of perjury if you give false testimony
ms choi until now you were the judge overseeing this trial correct
yes
you are also a witness who saw ms sung yoonah
yes i am
to be precise
yes i was
ms choi
the defendant and i…
are in love
yoonah
lets go to get minji
lets take her and go to my house
no
you dont know what hes capable of
yoonah dont be scared you did nothing wrong
none of this is your fault
lets not see each other anymore
if he finds out…
no if anyone finds out
stop talking nonsense
yoonah do you remember
do not fear for i am with you
i will be with you
lets find a way okay
i have to go before he wakes up
yoonah
so the defendant said shed go back before the victim wakes
yes thats correct
about what time was that
according to this dashcam footage
ms choi
i…
i was terrified of losing everything i have
but i realized…
losing that one person…
would mean…
losing everything i have
right now…
thank you ms choi
ms choi youre free to go
you may return to your seat
sorry im sorry

minji

two years later
yeoju prosecution
stop making excuses
should we issue the warrant
i promise theres nothing else
let me think about it
lets bring him in again okay
but protecting the truth
so i turned the light on
it usually kind of shows itself
what we can offer to you is a reasonable reduction
maybe i dont say it enough that actually

i dont know if ill make it in time
and
no92 your name is lee seungjin
but we could feel your love
pouring your heart into something is enough
thank you
hes just leaving
 seungjin  lee seungjin
lets do this
dorothy be reasonable
whiskey it is whiskey ja
adam and eve
the monster
instead of running away
of course
i want you here thats why im calling you
its just before you didnt say
im in terrible pain i need medicine
papa
think of me for once instead of her
ja vater
there is an emergency
and today youre leaving halfway through your third
its unavoidable my fathers in great pain and he needs me
as do we
with all respect
does your father always get everything he wants
doctor you as much as anyone
know the importance of my fathers work
 if youve a problem with it  the problem is yours
its called an attachment disorder
well
thanks for the analysis
oh so your daughter teaches
yes she also had
a private psychoanalytical practice for children
at first i was afraid that by following in my footsteps
anna would leave no mark of her own
i hoped that was my own narcissistic fear
oh the tangled webs we weave
when first we practice to deceive
yes annas dedicated to the science
 why are you married  no
oh do you live with someone
a woman or a man
homosexuality is not immoral
why so
moral sense in a man is created by fear
and that fear comes from
the castration complex
 so women have nothing to fear  precisely
without this fear
these impulses cannot be countered
then how are they countered
through traditional relationships
with husbands and fathers
you are a walking contradiction
well im human
im inherently flawed
and im deeply damaged
anna
you all right
yeah its nothing
tell me
i have to find a chemist
he has no one
 lets make some calls first  i will find one on my way home
then well go together
absolutely not
bernbridge isnt wrong you know
yes
and what else
doesnt smoking aggravate your mouth
mmhmm
it does
but im determined
to relish and revel in the only sexual pleasure left right
extraordinary weve been talking this long
and this is the first mention of sex
bravo well observed yes
but i think
the infant sucking on its mothers breast
ah took you less than a minute to bring god into sex
fascinating
but despite your church propaganda
progress
weve gone from sex being the subject never spoken of
to our not being able to talk of anything else
well perhaps we did ja
yes psychoanalysis is inherently sexual
oh yes we infantilize it turning it into the lie
that sex under any circumstances is perfectly normal and healthy
running through the old and new testaments
sex is to be shared between two people
who are committed to each other
well done good
ja a bestiary an encyclopedia of it
help me tie these apron strings will you
ja a bestiary
ja
wheres my cigar i left a cigar somewhere um
you always pick and choose those special bible verses
the ones that support your own virtuous bias
isnt that correct
its ridiculous
sadistic cruelty really
with a great orchestra
ja put these things in the sink
they arent going to wash themselves are they
would cause women to give up sex completely
especially as you say homosexuality isnt immoral
well perhaps lesbianism is different
perhaps unchecked it becomes progressively more unstable
no their conditions have a different source
i dont understand
her father
and what about your father
ah its too late to turn back now
my father and i
now theres an interesting tale
uh
made our peace before he died
he was
a good man
ja
he made up for financially
warnie we call him we call him warnie
just your brother
its complicated
ja
mm
i suppose i should have some starlets pic
its just me mum
there goes dinner
lewis
make me a promise
if something happens to me
and if anything happens to you
thats an order
so how much of that day do you remember
little to none i was
it was chaos from the outset
it was my last time over the bags
paddy and i made it into nomansland
jack
jack jack we cant stay here
hel
help
well i was going to take you out dancing
mrs moore
im so sorry
right
the letters you wrote to me after paddys death
they keep me close to him
he carried this with him
the shrapnel that killed him
its too close to my heart to remove it
now jack um
we need to talk about something quite serious
you told me about the promise
i might look ancient to you but
no you
quite the opposite
the right reply
or depending on anyone but myself
lets not look at it like a guardianship then
lets call it a friendship
agreed
a friendship
your friends mother
i wouldnt call it a relationship
any bond between two people is a relationship
mrs moore was in her early 40s
oh hmm
does mrs moore have a first name
janie ooh
tell me did you find janie an attractive woman
 when you first met her  she was my friends mother
often men who lose their mothers at an early age
are drawn to more mature women
i resent the implication
and my personal life is really not your concern
 oh really  mm
it fascinates me
ja
you lived with her with janie
or your battle trauma
my private life is precisely that yes
as you wish
hmm
but i consider what people tell me far less interesting
than what they choose not to tell me
well bully for you
let me
hello can i help you
no one can today im afraid

the sex doc

a wider circle of professional and personal acquaintances
besides myself

well perhaps we could
thats not necessary
i can speak with her then
no
 can i ask why  yes
anna and i have an understanding
that she will not consider any relationship

jofi
sorry i thought hed
ja
ja
hey i want to show you something
give me a hand thank you
 do you know momus  momus no
momus is a god
the greek god who chastised all the other gods of olympus
for their absurd their stupidity
so they banished him
to live with humanity
 ja  familiar theme
ja
he became the sad god
what would you call a confirmed nonbeliever
i am a passionate disbeliever
right and wrong good and evil choice between them
 ja  yeah
ja
i need more handkerchiefs
so what were we saying yes
and your god who created good or whatever that is
ja
he allowed lucifer to live he let him flourish
but logically he should have destroyed him
am i correct
think about it
god gave lucifer free will
which is the only thing that makes goodness possible
a world filled with choiceless creatures
who created prisons and slavery and
what
ja i hear you im not deaf
so is that your excuse
or is killing me gods revenge for my disbelief
professor lewis i am shocked i am shocked
i dont know and i dont even pretend to its
perfectly happy but were not were not
so god
god lacks goodness
or power
or both i dont know
well finally finally finally
were making progress
make us realize that happiness
real happiness eternal happiness
if if pleasure is his whisper
pain is his megaphone
oh ja
yes
well im sure that
the cherubic little altar boy adolf hitler
who served in his church every sunday morning
im sure hed agree with you ja absolutely totally
im afraid i cannot agree with you
we speak different languages
you know you believe in revelation fine
theres no common ground
why does religion make room for science
but science refuses to make room for religion
oh please youre breaking my heart
how capacious and comfortable
that the sun does not move around the world
precisely cause they hide behind their ignorance
cause were human
and our confidence in ourselves
ja ill show you something
that was
that was my daughter
sophie
she was a mother
and a wife
and my little grandson
he was plucked from us
killed by tuberculosis at the age of five
five years
ja
to kill a little boy
ill tell you something
so that i could hallucinate god
and seek my bloody vengeance on him
bloody hypocrites
and that is gods plan
we are on horseback
his family hates mine
hes avenging them
i cannot escape
the knight is coming closer closer
then he kisses me
his face to mine
his lips near my lips
red and dripping
he whispers
tell me your family secrets
how advanced is your cancer
it is inoperable
how much time
and it is a sin
 it is  ja
look in there
you see hells already arrived
she shares your superstitions
anna
anna no she knows im going to die ja
that youre planning to kill yourself
no why should i cause her pain
cause im tired
yes
actually
its all right
 is anna married  no
im surprised
you mean for anna to choose
dr jones today
dr ernest jones
yes he asked to see anna not you
he did
yes
but why would she need a mate
man woman both
please call later
we have the stage in five minutes
give me your phone she wont answer
lets go
today a huge crowd is eager to hear me
sighs but as i face that crowd today
i go back in time
when i was alone
very alone
kids booing when i screamed in silence
because i was alone then
very very alone
its in loneliness that it all ends
and its in loneliness where it all begins
its into my loneliness that you first walked in
but im still very alone even amidst a crowd
so i still look for you
i find myself when i look into your eyes
as i dive into your eyes i keep losing myself

you’re on your own now
i had an interview last month may crack it

im going for more money and respect
the audience and their choices are changing great
they shall now perform folk music before you
and offer my tribute to my guru pundit haripada ray
aditya
you cant speak like that dont misuse my dads legacy
whats bothering you that they cut short the list you made
look they dont prefer your music anymore
so whose music do they prefer
your aveek sanyals
throwing in some indian classical style in songs damn showoff
is that even music why bring in aveek here
your guru my dad it was from the streets that he came up too
please anwesha dont comment on what you dont understand
there were many girls believe me
but i chose you
you left for mumbai after our marriage
i was there i supported you
all that just to land a job at a local bengali channel
please save your piddling speech for aveek sanyal
you too used him quite well
feels nice to get attention from a stray dog isn’t it
what
go ahead
i won’t sing at this concert
smoke
once their masks fall off all men are the same
without your mercy
without your mercy how can i serve you lord
but now i feel like music too will abandon me like everyone else
i see now you were right
like his thumris
lalon fakir too is alone just like you are i are alone
no one will remember you but you
so when everyone leaves you remember to stand by yourself
humans are fundamentally alone
embrace it
without your mercy lord how can i serve you
rainy evenings by the window or a chilly afternoons
aveek sanyal
aveek has returned home after five long years
aveek none other than our minati’s son
aveek…
secretly i look for you
on streets alleys
i share my story with you in vain
among the sea of unknown faces
i lose sight of you
i restrict my laughter my zest for life
dont know the reason
i’m not present anywhere i live with hesitation
i don’t understand why
no one is my own to call
wounds dont stay hidden forever
i cant be stopped
my heart is not here in this land
its not for me
my heart is not here in this land
its not for me
unsaid words turned to to ashes now
why am i burning myself in this smoke
my soul is a wanderer but im homebound
these alleys these shadows that i left behind
that’s how i survive
wonder when i will see you again
when will i lose myself again
in my heart i believe
not a soul is my own to call
wounds dont stay hidden forever
i cant be stopped
my heart is not here in this land
the city too feels very lonely
its not for me

ok great
ronnie as soon as i come out of rehab
they told me its an inside job
and i was like really
ive been searching in the wrong places
but it was hard
and go okay
sam were you looking away from snooker for peace
yeah listen if i wanted to quit snooker
i couldve found peace man
and gone to buddhist centres
and sat there on a cushion and ate vegan food
and had a fantastic time
you know no stresses no work no this
ride a bicycle you know
but i was never gonna be that person
so it was kinda like id have that bit
and then id go and play snooker
and then id be like oh
and like the chaos would enter my life again
be happy and content
commentator ronnie breaking off
its nice to be able to have a good game to play indoors
either
 interviewer tea or coffee  neither
 interviewer cats or dogs  neither
 interviewer book or film  book
is played on this table
this is called a billiard table
on which you play either billiards or snooker
damien i watched snooker as a kid
i remember watching when i was younger
it was brilliant
the biggest sport on tv
millions of viewers
super high glory and drama
a really great example of art
because its full of contradictions
i love the fact that theoretically
you could make a machine to do it perfectly
sort of this kind of angular mathematical thing going on
man the different coloured balls score different points
when theyre potted
man oh dear
 interviewer home or abroad  both
interviewer eastenders or coronation street
neither
interviewer quality or quantity
both
 interviewer stick or twist  who
that’s a good description
just totally instinctive
he just gets down and like
what a shot left handed ladies and gents unbelievable
damien people who don’t know about snooker
they go don’t know snooker but i know ronnie
when you get to that level
interviewer savory or sweet
neither
interviewer family or friends
neither
interviewer comfort or adventure
both
and it creates you know massive highs
that’s a magnificent 147
no one especially as you get older
of fear of doubt of surety of confidence
sorry im yawning now im absolutely fucked
be there tuesday night play wednesday
everything’s alright i hope youre well mate
paid holiday mate huh
well no i had twelve days in york that was nice
york’s beautiful so that was nice
i had a couple days in liverpool
so i was with some friends and i was playing in bolton
so that was nice and then here
so its different but its a bit
so
hello
hello hello hello hello
compere good afternoon and a very warm welcome
here at venue cymru in llandudno
the rocket ronnie o’sullivan
but o’sullivan says he intends to make the most
of the beautiful north wales scenery
and indulge his passion for running
for over 12 months
ronnie o’sullivan and dominic dale
but a few errors today from o’sullivan
reporter hi ronnie great to have a sportsman
good victory today um
mm
mmm
mm
i love chinese tea man my favourite
so hopefully hes charging up for the new season
and if hes got a target to concentrate on
but then that’s not really what ronnie’s success is about
you know he says things like hed rather play good and lose
and that does my head in
cos i just think its all about winning
and you think for someone at ronnie’s level
he should think like that
but he genuinely doesn’t think like that
commentator for this tournament in north wales
and ronnie o’sullivan through to the last six
ronnie after three or four tournaments this year
because ive found a way of enjoying it
and ive found a way of it not killing me
ive found a way of going oh what
got beat see you tomorrow
all this and that you know
i thought about having a hip replacement
i said cos i think if i get this hip solid
i said cos its just a repetitive sport
and if i could repetitive get in the right line
i wanted to win titles
im a snooker player aint i
like what other option is there
i used to cry and he used to play all his mates
say hello to father christmas sit there
now hello hello guys
yes yeah why not
male voice ronnie o’sullivan has already won
ronnie yeah
five ten
were gonna try and teach you how to play snooker
its a sport that’s getting more and more popular
this is the event they all most desperately want to win
have their own snooker table in their garage
that was a tremendous performance
ronnie junior first of all are you really only 14
 yeah just six weeks ago  and im 14
and i went look im gonna build a massive big snooker room
i said im gonna have you
he went yeah
i said you come and work with me laughs
i was working up the west end
and it was exciting times for young men
working class boys getting good money
one day this fella said
down in charring cross road
you know cos i knew what was good sellers
ronnie in porn he’s well known as mr sullivan
 people should respect him  o’sullivan
hes just a domesticated husband
see how the other half live
fucking hell
and wherever we happened to be
we’re gonna play there today
know youse was gonna be alright
come and collect you
and i thought hes safe
and i just loved playing snooker
man when ronnie joined the club he was ten
and he played a member and he knocked in 117 break in the first round
ronnie i remember the day snooker changed for me
we was at barking snooker centre
and i remember i got to the last 16
and i remember beating this guy
were like two frames id never played before in my life
i ended up winning the tournament
something clicked and made me realise
and then from that moment onwards
that become the fascination for me
commentator he has beaten jimmy white
to become the youngestever champion
hendry i was world champion
but i remember there was talk about this kid in essex
how talented he was
and um played an exhibition
just pure ability
the natural game for ronnie similar to myself
and win frames in one visit
that’s when youre in the zone
he had that ability then
reporter attention turns to llandudno this evening as two of snooker’s alltime greats
o’sullivan has struggled to find his rhythm so far
ronnie o’sullivan to get us underway in the 72nd version
of this longheld rivalry
but that’s not true
commentator no
white dyou understand while hes still capable
he will still keep wanting to win
but you cant keep switching on and off
so john is looking he could be a long way to winning this match
but for allround match play excellence
o’sullivan hed love to finish in the second century
yeah well played john
commentator quite brilliant from john higgins
youll be lucky to see a more complete display from
just because i played absolutely shit
cant wait to get home
you alright
i listen to myself now and i just think fuck whats happened to me
that ive kind of ripped out any joy that was in me
sorry nothing to it
but i lacked a lot of confidence
but i needed that guidance
im like im nine or ten
ronnie sr alright
ronnie i needed it i think
because you know i
as a player as a person
maria i remember when it first happened sam
and i just knew something wasnt right
his manager barry hearn phoned me up he said
maria you’ve gotta tell him
i said barry i cant
because he im trying to protect him sam
i thought if he goes there three days early
and i heard him screaming screaming down the phone sam
cos i knew how close they were
my regret now is sam
but i thought id protect him and it was wrong
and i don’t think he ever forgave me for that ronnie
you should’ve told me but i couldn’t
and that’s one regret ive got
it broke in half
he tried to shove the other half in my face
i blocked it with my fingers he severed my fingers
right i backed off
and i don’t remember nothing after that
but i know i took that man’s life
and i know i hurt the other one
and i don’t wanna talk aboutn this
because its not fair on the people that have lost their son
im still alive thank god
not cried for meself
i cried for me family losing everything
i left em didn’t i
know what i mean
i didn’t think he was gonna play anymore
everything was over
ronnie nothing can prepare you for that
i just couldn’t believe it
we got the verdict through
he
you get a bit emotional sometimes don’t you
really you get emotional and you
and uh
typical
just tell my boy to win
that’s it
ronnie o’sullivan
announcer ronnie o’sullivan
commentator hes not 18 yet
you know just fuck everybody
the healthiest thing for me to do would probably be just stop playing snooker
now im a man
and ive gotta go out and do what i do best
and that’s play snooker
that’ll be definitely for me dad
commentator snooker history here
and hes done it
ronnie o’sullivan
arrived at gartree prison
just a normal whatever normal life is
but looking back at that it was a nightmare
people could see that i was imploding
gone on in the last few months
a mixture of i think depression and rage
commentator greater players deservedly
white but he can go and play nearperfect snooker
white but as a perfectionist
he could get down on himself
commentator perfect yes absolutely perfect
has made the fastest ever maximum break in history of the game
he cleared the table in just five minutes 20 seconds
i just wanna be happy
hendry a lot of people talk about genius in sport
but that is genius in sport
it is so difficult
i think its the greatest thing that’s happened in any sport ever
he played a match against me
he beat me
referee seven
hendry but certainly in the 90s
i always felt i was mentally stronger
because you cant imagine any sport being psychologically intense as snooker
referee thirty
and it’ll devastate you
referee ronnie o’sullivan 30
wood he drowned his sorrows
and escaped it
he’d have an ounce
and that was the indulgence of addiction
hed have highs and lows and hed be right up on a buzz
and then he’d go flat as a pancake
and i thought whats wrong with him
im gonna im gonna do this
yeah
ronnie at this moment i look back and i think wow how have i got through that
cos it was that bad
the darkness and stress and addiction
i didn’t know how to live sober
and they tried to teach me that in the priory
cos it drives me on but just needs to be managed
we done like five six miles round here
and that’s when i got in to the running
chuckling hashtag mental health
been saying that for 20 odd years mate
that’s the funny thing people will be like
i was 20 years ahead of the game mate
they all jumped on the bandwagon
that’s what i love you got all the bandwagoners
oh mental health
its cool to be mental health now
jesus christ
chuckling oh
and we’ll just play it by ear and do what we gotta do
cos its 2000 people whatever it is its in london
alright mate bye bye bye
damien i once had a time with ronnie
look im in the masters
he goes do you think im bad pulling out
and i just said look ive got the car ive called the priory
don’t worry about barry hearn
and he went okay
and he calmed down a bit and said
dyou wanna have a little knockabout
and then he went i think i might play this afternoon
i went okay ill stay with you
and i stayed and he won the fucking tournament
now i tell that story its ridiculous but its all real
its like no glory’s worth it if youre not alright
as the world’s top 16 players battle it out
for the masters title at alexandra palace
hendry the two tournaments that i wanted to win
and the masters
cos the masters is the top 16 players in the world
the masters is intense
commentator hello good afternoon and welcome to alexandra palace
always an electric atmosphere when ronnie o’sullivan is in town
all night all this morning i was like making myself ill
went to the gym didn’t overdo it
you know obviously its like
commentator ronnie o’sullivans own masters records
announcer ronnie o’sullivan
not knowing from one day to the next
is my game gonna be good
and ill do that every day
ive had six days where its been great
but youre just hanging on
and then the seventh day its gone
and youre like oh i knew it’d happen
commentator he’ll be pretty annoyed with himself
what hes shaking hands this is quite incredible
don’t know whats going on
ive never seen anything like this
you just don’t do that
he just said hes had enough
its bizarre
man we all want to see ronnie playing at his best
its what people come to see
but sadly there is a flaw there
if you want to get a large audience anywhere
theyre gonna do something where they may die
that theres like death involved
i shared all his snooker tournaments
and ive heard the anxiety in him
just totally like collapsing on the phone
and i haven’t been really well
i blame myself for that you know going to prison
and hes saying ive had enough
yeah he wanted to put his cue down done
and just make a decision and do it
this my last season as a player to be honest with you
thought about it yeah heavily
inaudible sometimes you know
and if you win its even better
announcer ladies and gentlemen here comes the rocket
ronnie osullivan
people listen to the chaos in my life
and i go yeah but that’s the only time that
and i just think you know what im safe here
ah
you fall in love and out of love with snooker well i do
and for me snooker’s fantastic when youre in that space
and youre able to do it
because obviously the pressure there
the more you can deliver under pressure
you don’t think
your mind feels clear
and quiet
its like youre razor sharp
and its just yeah yeah its just good
huh
it feels good it feels powerful
ronnie i had moments when i was young where id feel invincible
and you’ll be enjoying every bit of this ronnie
playing as well as he can
 ronnie  ronnie thanks guys
that reception tells you everything
yeah i struggled early on you know
such a big crowd been playing behind closed doors for so long
let alone a crowd like this full of mad londoners
announcer and from one big match to another great afternoon
well i just savour every match i play uh
ive just gotta keep thinking of that
announcer well done this afternoon ronnie
they absolutely loved it
ronnie o’sullivan ladies and gents
but he fucking bought the scones
its my favourite from marks and spencer’s
it has to be from ms cos they just do it right
wood ronnie deserves to have more of that feeling all the time
and the flow
but robertson’s in excellent form this season
referee thank you ladies and gentlemen
commentator gets this match underway
yes and i don’t think it needs any explaining no matter how good you are
theres gonna be that little bit of tension in the arm ronnie just overhit that
whenever you play ronnie o’sullivan
particularly in the masters
and it looks that way now for neil robertson
and he thinks ronnie will serve him
in his backyard by six frames to four
ronnie first time in a long time
probably five six years
so like in that environment that venue with that crowd
youre okay with it though arent you
i just think its about management
theres just so much selfcriticism involved i think
 than i ever have been  no i think you are
but i think that’s your mood today
when you see it in a romantic way
but the reality is
and that’s when the kinda questions come in
so you notice it
jesus why is he doing this
why does he put himself through it
its like so like soul destroying
dyou know what i mean but that’s because i think cos you do love it
i think it did help yeah
going alright listen you know
 yeah  you know
because i wanna play you know
and going this is actually good for me
yeah
otherwise its like selfsabotage isnt it
its like selfharm
yeah no no yeah no
 which you’ve gone in to  absolutely
i wont ever go there again
 no  no
i think i got so good at being hard on myself
work this brain
that if i do x y and z
im gonna be alright
ronnie i think a big thing for me is i have this fear that im gonna fall apart
peters whats gonna make you win
its gotta be all about what you do on the table
anything else is even including your own thoughts
feel a few butterflies out there boom boom boom
and that’s why you were getting really in a distressed state
eighteen years
i tell you what the biggest thing i felt though when we first met
and i was expecting that and you didn’t
because its common sense its selfevident that happy people win in life
and then we’ll work on the rest
ronnie yeah
you’ve got there
well if you i mean snooker obviously
its a sport that’s not as physical as some
and clearly you will lose it as you get older
cos youre not gonna be doing this when youre 80 at this standard i assume
why ask the question why not see what you do
id like to go you know what ive got ten years
i don’t have an answer what i can say is that if you keep looking at your age
youre gonna start saying oh im 46 i wont do as well
and i don’t want that i think if you wanna win
the next 17 days at the crucible theatre
and a chance for one of the 32 players
hendry when you used to drive down
you know i wanted to beat steve davis’s six
ronnie wants to beat my seven you know
although he never admits it but he does
your game your skill your stamina your temperament your compo everything
and even when i go back there now i get goose bumps
cos its just the greatest place to play snooker
radio presenter big 17 days of snooker as the world snooker championship
commentator yeah i think that this particular stat
of seven world championship wins
i watched him in the last tournament i thought he played outstandingly well
you know on his first world ranking title at 17 that was in uk
and his most recent
its not suited for me
but its a choice you know ive got a choice
you know its like i always said you have two systems
hurt you know and suffer
but that’s not gonna win me the world championships you know
sometimes you have to choose which one youre
yeah okay
why don’t you have this breakfast
no no ill wait ill wait
give me them them eggs then that’ll do
wicked
yeah
 its all very civilised jim isnt it  yeah
yeah how things have changed
how dyou feel you played yesterday
yeah yeah yeah
when you was three nil down right
what dyou think happened there then
but i wasnt just flowing it werent like bang bang bang bang bang
there was a point where i was sitting there going
and that’s what you do at sheffield
jimmy yeah but you don’t show youre nervous
no i know cos you kinda like
cos you know its hard hes playing you right
jimmy normal circumstances from six three got control of the game
ronnie yeah yeah absolutely
hes got that pressure ball red in the middle and hes sort of thought
ronnie yeah im in
and he missed the red and that’s all over
but that still werent enough
that’s what im saying snooker’s a craz
of course it is
jimmy i just feel for me i just feel youre sharp
 are you  yeah because its great
ronnie i hate i cos that means
its all snooker and youre buzzing cos of snooker
 oh don’t say that  shut up
 oh mate  listen
i wanna yeah i wanna im enjoying playing
its mustard innit
hendry when youre playing against ronnie
that’s the worst thing you can do ive seen players do it
cos he never has to think
its what even now stands him apart from the rest
but you come to the crucible and you think
god ive gotta play well for 17 days gotta be concentrating
ive gotta play my best ive gotta have the courage
to overcome players in that arena day after day after day
and negative thoughts can creep in
think he needs to try and forget about that tip
id say probably six seven times in the last six
referee 26 ronnie o’sullivan
breaks of 87 131 and 96 were the highlight from the six times champion
mate stays out there
 interviewer thank you  what you done its your hair
your hair looks good like that thank you
male voice you gonna do then not enough press
not enough tournaments not enough press these fuckers are doing my head in
referee 30
man well
ronnie theres enough meat on it
damien but i think one thing that ronnie maybe doesn’t realise
is that people like the hope and the fears
they like him fucked and pulling off a good shot
rather than just doing amazing shots and playing perfect snooker
perfect snooker’s kinda boring
hes always looking for perfection i don’t think its about perfection
its about drama
fucking hell mate oh god
yeah yeah
bit like serena williams a bit like tiger woods maybe
i had that type of fatherfigure where he was just like
i werent bothered i was happygolucky
so like i say it doesn’t come natural to me
its hard to sort of settle for anything less
right running you run you play better
i was like okay
with his mate in the car i know fuck humiliating
ronnie sr ron there’s no way youll beat me
 no way  nah
ronnie i thought yeah alright been right on pretty much everything else
made me realise that he was right i was just a lazy bastard
i still don’t wanna do the hard work
and he werent having it
im telling you mate hes got like this fucking thing
where he just makes you believe you can do anything
honestly its fucking scary
and now i just take certain bits cos i think if i was to listen to him
id probably run off the fucking cliff and go i can fly
and obviously ronnie used to look up
and think that’s how he thought he should be
ronnie sr well played ronnie
two players youve done em son
get down that line boy come on son let’s work
interviewer no nerves about being on television no
interviewer so dad knows his place
and you certainly seem to know yours ronnie well done
thanks
cos i was watching him play and i thought he hits the ball different
but he was so vulnerable
you know he hits the ball better than me everyone’s hitting the ball 
everyone’s better than him
and then he’d win the tournament and i go you’ve just won the bloody tou
whats going on how comes we win the tournament with you
but you know still not happy
so much style and finesse
perfection
that’s what he he was looking for
hes still trying to master it
the six times champion ronnie o’sullivan
and the four times winner john higgins
its ronnie o’sullivan who gets this match underway
referee ronnie o’sullivan to break
ronnie some players can grind it out
got a good temperament theyre very methodical very robotic
and you just think he aint breaking down
i remember john higgins give me a complete smashing in one semifinal
that hurt me you know i felt humiliated
im an instinctive player i play better when im instinctive
i play better when i don’t have to engage my brain
referee thirty eight
god jesus thats
its
referee ronnie o’sullivan 30
for fuck’s sake man unbelievable
i think that getting sucked in to playing at that pace then im fucked
know what i mean two hours
yeah but im just saying like but i
its like selbylike snooker
 worse  know what i mean
i wanna keep you out there as long as i can until fucking you crack
and get bored know what i mean but i aint
yeah
set my shot up i aint you know what i mean
they can do that for as much as they like i don’t fucking care
cos i aint got nowhere to go anyway
 yeah  know what im saying
cant beat a salmon and cream cheese mate
 no  no
between these two legends of the game steve
neither player has been able to dominate so far
john higgins then built a six five lead
to level proceedings at six all at the midsection interval
ronnie gotta play the right shot play it positive
man hes blinking cycling himself out of it
well he might win this match he might win a few matches
but at some point someone’s gonna come out
i wanna be that person that plays the game a winning game at all times
if my game’s on and im playing ill win if i aint fuck it you know
one of them things but im not going negative
man no
commentator starting to impose himself
come on
cos i know that if you win playing a losing game eventually you get fucked
dyou know what im saying man yeah
commentator john higgins led three nil
its very absorbing the session of snooker goodness me the intensity in it
what is at stake incredible semifinal
ronnie agh balls snap
whipping it
commentator all eyes at where the black goes
and in a poor place for o’sullivan
look where the black’s gone
no way of getting on the black from this it seems
jesus state of this table
commentator i tell you what hes looking at taking the red on
top cushion and back in round behi
this’ll be the shot of the championship if he pulls this off
it goes
brilliant shot then wasnt it really was
quite simply a mustpot on the black now
it looks good if it misses the blue
the slightest of angles try and get somehow on to the yellow
this is tough
its there ronnie o’sullivan has done almost the impossible in this round
even a little reaction from ronnie there
robbie huxley absolutely deserved some bit of luck
 that final frame  i had fuckall luck
yeah that final frame was stupendous
unbelievable jesus
i played the canon on the red to get the red out there
yeah that was amazing black
and then i pinged the yellow in ive zipped it in
i played a good brown i flicked it in
and i thought oh whoa
 know what i mean  john wayne stuff
oh john wayne
it was blinking true grit
anyway well done
only halfway through mate
oh
i know yeah i know you struggled in that half
i know you struggled
around the world as well its just incredible what hes trying to achieve here
cos i might not ever make another final
truth is i might not ever make another final dyou know what i mean crucible final
i want you to experience being here with people
like you sure you know i went no come let em come down
so today i just kinda need that quiet
other than just a knock on the door five minutes boom go out there play
around the world snooker championship
the final between ronnie o’sullivan
this final doesn’t need any hype as it should be a bank holiday blockbuster
judd trump is also a fastattacking player
hes trying to be crowned crucible king for a second time
he says playing the sport’s biggest star in the final
is a career highlight for him
sometimes when i look out this window
you look out and you think
god all them people enjoying themselves and im in here
he was playing in the world finals with graeme dott
if hes not in the balls tap once and then ill know whats happening
and then i had to go radio five live
radio presenter theyre opening five frames
and im pacing about the wing and im thinking fucking hell
cos the rocket’s just finishing off at the crucible phillips done
at night where its all quiet everyone’s got their nut down
you know boom boom boom boom
six hundred cons smashing the doors for my son
it just blew me away you know
you couldn’t give me a billion pound for that experience
as hes getting older i think hes managed to cope with the anxiety the pressure
and i think hes learnt to push it down a little bit
but ronnie likes living on the edge
about 20 years ago i realised
to find happiness within snooker was a dangerous thing
but sometimes you have to
ronnie the world championships when that door opens
and im saying no i wanna win this tournament and then youre off and running
this is the one that matters the first frame
the first mistake could be costly
and the little shifts in momentum you know
where the other guy’s on me but you kind of have to respond
referee six
its just little shots like that
the difference between winning and losing the game
ronnie and that momentum and that speed
and that energy is sort of
its getting stronger and stronger
to the point where youre all over your opponent
commentator well that’s referee twenty six
commentator that little shot
ronnie youre strangling him its just that that power
referee eight
referee ronnie o’sullivan eight
 fucking  the first seven
nightmare
commentator so unlucky to snooker himself
 yeah  ive seen a gesture
 sorry a gesture  yeah
cos you saw nothing you saw nothing
go and look at your camera you saw nothing don’t start
don’t start go and check your camera
there is no inbetween
yeah theres no stopping it basically
commentator and a chance if ronnie can get this black
how did he play
ronnie o’sullivan placed his lead twelve frames
barring one of the great crucible comebacks
ronnie o’sullivan is on course to even stephen hendry’s record of seven
its very hard to see a way back for trump
i mean hes in real trouble
ronnie hi mate yeah im just
don’t know what to think really to be honest with you
and im not sure if i played good bad
everyone seems to think it was really great and this and that
i don’t know if he was just bad and it made me look good
gotta go again tomorrow take it easy bye
the pressure that ronnie’s under is like some sort of horrific torture
and loads of its imagined and loads of its real
still the same stuff
as im talking to you now im sort of shaking a bit
you know
man because youre talking or just because
its the buildup
commentator this afternoon the situation is very simple for judd trump
there’ve been early chances for both players
but it looks like trump is the favourite to claim this frame
commentator can ronnie find something here
been playing second fiddle most of this session
crowd oh
ronnie nervy nervy nervy nervy nervy nervy
 nervy mate  and hes won all three
hate this bit i hate this bit
part of the job isnt it
stick with it
commentator hes needed two opportunities to claim this frame
im questioning my technique im out there and thinking
oh i don’t wanna stand here stand there
get on that line get on this line get there
but i then think how am i gonna go and play
referee thirty three
man great shot
ronnie fuck that i feel ill
 are you alright  feel ill with pressure
judd trump has just won the last two frames which were close
he now trails 13 ten so its game on
especially if trump can win the final two frames of this session
ronnie i feel fucked energy’s drained
 youre fine  no i cant
yeah weve got a break now were gonna regroup
its like i cant even put the cue through
no but even on every shot i think im gonna miss this like fuck
im looking i think im blurry eyes honestly steve
like honestly fucking horrendous
you’ve gotta go out there with attitude now
ronnie hi mate i just thought id send you this voice note
i froze today mate
and i fucking hate this shit mate
but im just sharing it with you mate
i just wanna get this over and fucking done with
i feel fucking battered alright ill speak to you later bye
not just a snooker robot
i think ronnie did an amazing job
a very noble job
of saying
how fucked up he is inside
and how hes fucking thinking you know
so much out of his system with the game
but what about ronnie now
a real match and judd trump has all the momentum
sports reporter its worth mentioning that its judd who’s won
the last four finals between these guys
over the last what three four years
sports reporter yeah and i think if you offered ronnie
shaking
commentator everybody asking the same question what happens now
now first half opportunity for ronnie o’sullivan
this lone red in to the bottom right corner pocket
got a bit to do with the cue ball here
it looked easy some shot hes played there
fuck me i feel absolutely bashed up
i feel bashed up steve
i don’t feel i can make 20 when i get the balls i don’t
i feel better than i did i feel a bit calmer
commentator yeah just looks so relaxed so cool
referee thirty four
commentator wouldve said at times in this afternoon’s session
its understandable of course on a precipice of history glory
out in to play a little cannon
o’sullivan wins three of the first four
and one away from winning his seventh world championship title
so hes gotta win seven on the bounce
commentator well this red is potable but
hes played the cannon
fabulous pot
but when i was watching him
he’ll get that mantle
and just this black
and hes gonna join you now stephen
referee sixty eight
because he plays the game
to submerge it so that just didn’t perform on day one left to play
ronnie o’sullivan is in seventh heaven
inaudible against judd trump
eighteen frames to thirteen
enjoy yourself enjoy yourself don’t let em burn you out
youre too good to let them fucking burn you alright
no listen youre a good boy
ill always take my time for you i respect you youre a good man

that was me kinda going in the trenches
and kind of having to go no i wanna win this tournament
but with snooker you’ve gotta put up
with all that toxic sort of competitiveness that
that’s why i have to just play
cos its like you cant win
there’s no end to like hes falling hes slipping
oh now hes winning hes great
and then hes losing oh hes slipping oh is his days numbered
im like oh god ive heard that for 30 years

so youre the luo zhi
from zhenhua high school
the teacher would take your essays as examples
sorry
we broke up
you know what
they were planning to go abroad together
but he stayed here
to be my friend instead
take me as an example
im striving to introduce chinese cinema to the world
and how can i make that happen
under my leadership
the film club will produce a historical scifi movie
to show chinas progress in science and technology
its powerful industry
and concern for humanity
ive already thought of the title
endless love
youre made for that role
the production will start this weekend
and the lead actress is luo zhi
youre the lead actor say something
come and join us when youre free
please
great
why
cut
you saw leonids before
coming director
we need more blood
professionalism is key
get our stuff
the ufo
leave it run
ill sit there
today were gonna analyze a case
company a contracted company b to carry out a project
to get overtime pay for the spring festival
mr zhang from company b worked for 52 hours nonstop
which resulted in his sudden death
the plaintiffs are zhangs family
apart from company b
can company a also be considered a defendant
i think company a
should take some responsibility what do you think
go tell the professor
these two names are interesting
because they are both from one chinese poem
sheng huainan
here
luo zhi
here
luo zhi will be the prosecution lawyer
when the accident happened
the accident happened on a dispatch mission from the defendant
therefore apart from company b
your honor
yes
the plaintiffs family member was indeed the defendants employee
but since the moment
company a contracted with company b for the project
all obligations and responsibilities
were also assigned to company b
although company b was contracted
company as responsibility to the deceased can be assigned
so such joint responsibility is invalid
may i remind you
that in this case
hes not just a plaintiffs family member or just another zhang
hes flesh and blood
he chose to trust you
he devoted his energy and time to you
did you review their health protection system for workers
he was willing to do extra work for you
but you dont feel gratitude
dont you feel guilty
i agree with the prosecution lawyers argument
sorry for the wait
thanks
 im leaving  okay
hey
why do you think
im hungry so i came to grab a bite
be careful
thanks
i suppose you know that eating like this
wont get me any commission whatsoever
huh
luo zhi
why not
so
thats the norm for most people
hello
baili
what about my girlfriends dress
you think you can bully us just because were working students
pay for it
can you
sorry
sorry
an extra n
ill give you 300 im so sorry
go away
stop fighting
stop
stop
 mingrui lets split  okay
run
stop
whats your problem
over there
you were right
i always judge others through my own lenses
i didnt even know i was hurting others
to make a living
its good
i feel ashamed
thats okay
your sense of superiority just saved us
have you watched only yesterday
back in high school
one day i saw a line from that movie
written on the wall by someone else
i really like that movie
so i wrote back to her
i used to think
it was ye zhanyan

train k152 dongshan to xiamen
i knew
this would happen eventually
a week has passed
he vanished
to sheng huainan i need to tell you something important
the sheng huainan from our school
why did he cheat
his dad right
they say he asked a rich guy for help
whos also from our college
he agreed to help as long as sheng sat the exam for him
it serves sheng right
ironically
came from others
but i knew
the worst offender
was me
mom
what brought you here
the verdict was guilty
our hard work paid off
your dad…
your dad can rest in peace
will you promise me something
no matter what happens…
during those years
sure
now im ahead of him
but ive lost him
luo zhi
what are you talking about
when are you gonna tell him
who you really are
wheres my diary
give it back
compared to yours
even if i failed to replace that excitement in his heart
unlike you
yet you slowly got close to him
and destroyed him
in any case
i want to thank you
once his mother gets better
and with his consent
ill travel abroad with him
and finish school there
she said
she had received her punishment
but now
the punishment was over

and… you cant even sit in the circle
diego you seem nervous and mad too

yes the inability to communicate
that ugly thing that takes hold of us and makes us feel tremendously alone
closed due to flooding
can someone tell me…
wow
cool huh
we made a couple changes
im noticing suspicious behavior in the restaurant i repeat…
fuck you shithead armando
that way you can really unleash your talents
fuck you
clara with this in mind
in which the most disruptive performances contemporary art has to offer
is combined with the usual refinement of flavor that our chef is known for
the artist gina brings the question of our inability to communicate to life
im just tidying up here
clara in the figurative art space
a dialogue both desired and denied
youll be treated to a performance
that will make you ponder the violence and sexualization of modern life
that seems like the whole purpose no
chuckles softly okay
why dont you do it
for one night let your other self out the stranger the madman
whoever it is let them join us for an experience like no other
dont worry clara maybe youll discover…

evening is something wrong
hello good evening miss
are you aware that playing music in a restaurant requires a permit
sorry sir we have the permit
no it bothers me that someone doesnt trust me
here what happened to you
making a joke why
yes its fake okay no more music in here
hey guys get them to stop playing right now
take care of them
dont give them your ids
set an example and be the first to show your id
dont give them your id give me your identification now
theres a fire
stop them at the door
double fire theres a fire
fuck you asshole come with me
were all free everybody
bianca everybodys free
papa what happened nothing i scratched myself
come on through here
okay come on
oh so youre interested
nineteen thousand euros my god
you falsified a permit
but his passion was pills chemistry
and there were well snowballs ecstasy
terrifying visions a lot of horror
he visited his friend and the little brother
bright colors very expensive
of course the kid says no because he cares it was new
and somehow through a kind of game
as soon as theyre pinned down
he takes the helmet anyway and their wallets
and takes them all like theres no tomorrow
but he finds he cant articulate the words cant seem to speak at all
he feels scared
and wanted to destroy the world
i realized that if i used one ounce of that energy
to do something other than being pissed off
in that moment i decided and i did it
its incredible and you had them all working
and then you destroyed everything
here
what does residential mean i sleep there
is diego coming too no hell remain here
because that young man
is always there
good luck clara
clara excuse me
hello
anna hmm
i was awake
sure
id fall asleep if i was surrounded by all this too
well um…
merry christmas
tomorrow no
well…
its not only my face thats shitty
im just…
all wrong i suppose
i tell lies all the time just because
thats all
but to me you are the best thing that has ever happened
ill see you tomorrow for some meatballs with red sauce okay
we like the idea of exclusivity
good i think
what does it pay
uh… tortellini
did you make them
until they were red like your face right now
and maybe add a couple of hits while were at it why dont you
look diego
focus on what you do have
which trust me
it was vietnam
uh…
and this person
this someone who is me
for the person you are
which is an enormous immense
pain in the ass
all right youre a little unhinged
but weve made it this far right
and thats not for everyone
trust me
i just dont feel like taking this job by myself you know
sighs all right then draw another line
this young lady
who yes has her own faults
but she supports you
so look
keep her close to you
keep her close
hmm
dinners from 800 to 900
then brings you back at 300
they want you downstairs in an hour for group
and welcome
thank you
good but a bit temperamental
come on in
hello maam sit down there
theyre really lively and unfortunately my daughter brought them to me
ah yes very much
you… disappeared
uh… uh…
so what
hey
huh you said im not good enough for you right
diego listen listen hey
listen listen listen
i… was missing a piece
okay ive always been missing a piece okay
now ive… found it
so you… you cant disappear okay
you said it
you said i was a problem
you said that we were two problems were two fucking problems
a big mess no
they make two who understand each other
of course i dont mind
and you too
i dont understand all the crap you say
because to me youre fine
and youre fine really
just how you are
were still two problems
like pizza with figs
instead but you dont understand how…
hmm…
uh…
oh…
uh…
hmm…
and please
uh if thats how you react ill…
hmm…
well yes
yes but i… i like it
because youre… youre really soft
yes
 let us begin
 why a newtons cradle
 it focuses the mind
 john doe
 hes ex special forces
a soldiers soldier
 just a man trying to do his country proud
 so explain this to me doctor
expands the processing power of the brain
has remained virtually stagnant
but with every technological leap forward
 ive heard your pitch before
but what makes this version of the chip better
 interesting you can make him do things
 we can plant ideas
we didnt tell him to eat that apple
and his brain took over from there
 just wait
turn it on
sort of like a smartphone unless you remove the battery
but now were  fully engaged
 the chip helps him analyze the surroundings
and come up with a solution to whatever problem he may face
 lion
crocodile
snake
tiger
 impressive
 ive seen enough
turn him off
shut it all down
 what
 security breach
 turn off the chip
 im trying
 abort the subject
 do it
 hit the kill switch abort
 hit it abort
 anywhere the spirit goes 
 and nobody knows 
 i got a way of holding on 
 when im feeling lost 
 go and listen to my guide 
 confusion and losing 
 is never really in my way 
 try your hardest to believe 
 that youll receive 
 but youre gonna be just fine just fine 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 gotta know the way youre living living 
 in a different dimension mension 
 thats why im still alive unlike him
so what just happened doctor
 a minor setback
 the new and improved chip malfunctioned
 chip didnt malfunction the subject malfunctioned
 now i understand what went wrong
theyll get him
 yep theyre doing a bang up job already
 this didnt happen with any of the female subjects
john doe was supposed to follow orders
the chip leaves you no other option
 then perhaps he still is
 whered he go
 somewhere without cameras
 wherever he is
he somehow just access the mainframe
 precisely
wonderful
 cut off all communications
done
 wheres my team
 approaching now
subject is not present
hes not going anywhere
 can we still track the subject
 not at the moment sir
he has no one thats why we picked him
 just understand doctor
 you have an uncontrolled
dangerous military asset offsite
 and you are who again
 well then ms agent
the smart people are talking now
 enough
were gonna activate the original subjects
 i wouldnt dream of it senator
 i thought meeting in dark scary alleys
in foreign countries was my thing not yours
 why come to me
 because ylan said i could trust you
what needed to be done
one of the chip program financiers just tried to sell me
but i think you win
 oh my goodness an expense account why not use it
get some food maybe a drink
and then go to sleep
im waiting for someone
 and hes late
have a nice night
 yes
and now you have one
thank you
im john
 jane
 two more of whatever shes having
whats your story john
 well so far so good
 all right then mr super spy
what am i thinking right now
 how do i get rid of this devilishly handsome stranger
 youre half right
 which half
 the chip is a prototype
before they implanted it in your head
as badly as yours
 mm touche
so who was this poor guinea pig
 han wynn a vietnamese operative
was the original subject
like all the ladies were
 cat
 wait
 yes doctor
 benson wasted no time putting han to work
it was supposed to be a simple file retrieval job
but the mark came home
and the chip took over and put her into survival mode
once the threat was eliminated the chip disengaged
and han realized what she had become
in her head
 but you do
especially if it allows me to spend time with you
okay that was a better line
 i wouldnt take it that far
before my friend gets here
to go back to your place before your friend gets here
really
for that to happen
thank you
 arent you breaking some super spy code or something
and so did han
her chip didnt come with all the bells
and whistles mine does
no tracking or safety protocols either
 technically yes but really the doctor did
at the moment he put that chip in agent hans head
 dr cain the one who invented the chip
the one responsible for the whole program
 oh that dr cain
the secret super spy doctor
the one who apparently likes quoting george bernard shaw
 but ive never heard of senator benson
to get a super chip implanted in his head
 not even close
that honor went to american indian ylan romero
after the han disaster
the doctor was allowed to choose the next subject
also like me he had no family no connections
and no one to miss him
except for his old friend
the tribal police chief
 it wont be televised
 welcome to the program
he rescued someone who needed rescuing
and exposed the whole program to scrutiny
 the disappearing secret hero
 marena sure thought so
 an assistant to one of the chip programs financiers
who stumbled across something she wasnt supposed see
not all of them legal
maybe marina knew about some of them
maybe she didnt
she knew how dangerous ketrov could be
but she had made her decision
 give her to terezin
he always liked her
for a test run
 but unlike the original chip
the one implanted in ylan did have tracking
and safety protocols
so they were able to reign him in
before things got too outta control
ill give you that
 all good stories do
 no not yet
i was still another upgrade away
 after ylans shaky start
they chose a civilian bindi lamar
supposedly saw her in a cafe
the thought was that if they could train someone
a true sleeper agent
 fox
wolf
spider
cheetah
hawk
and they wasted no time
in testing out the new recruit
mr titit one of the programs other financiers
needed some files still on the old fashioned way
so they sent the unassuming bindi
to do what they trained her to do
they were confident that the chip would fill in the gaps
and they were right
and she didnt go rogue
 oh there were more
 senator benson called them his crows
because they could be anywhere
always watching always waiting
 this guy sounds like the ultimate creepy uncle
 but unless youre secretly
i assume that your program started recruiting men again
 they did as you can guess
but limited city of crows
he wanted to push the technology forward
and finally make a super spy
i was a finely tuned weapon
and that was before the chip
i had but two loves
serving my country
and the bottle
thats how the doctor recruited me for the program
with the help
of the doctors very convincing assistant vivian
 youll be better than before
smarter and more skillful in every way
youll have the calculating power
of the most advanced microchip ever invented
assisting you in any and all decisions you may face
there wont be anything you cant do
 im honored and lucky to be chosen
 there is no good luck only good planning
being a super spy who wouldnt want that
to my place because vivian picked you up
and took you back to hers
 actually it was my place vivian and i went back to
 my thinking exactly
you havent even touched your drink
but being sober has a way
 abort
 so when i was escaping the doctor and his facility
or just previous attempts lying there waiting for orders
and i didnt care
oh hell
 wow i guess your upgraded chip
really is the best version
 id like to think so
 well considering were still in this bar
not back at my place id say not so good
im just a lowly office drone
who spends her days sending pointless emails
yes this is jane
answering phones
and now attending a boring outta town business conference
sipping a glass of wine
and getting ready for bed
 but instead youre in the hotel bar waiting for a woman
is entertaining me
please continue
plugged in the damaged tablet i swiped
and sent out a message
to activate all the other chip owners
actually to use the doctors term
i sent them all a suggestion
do as trained and strike back those responsible
bindi was back at the cafe
when they would permanently deactivate her
mr titit used her first
the next suggestion went to ylan
ylan knew that after rescuing marina
his days were numbered
to go after the target i sent him yuri ketrov
 hello
victor
 oh this story got exciting
theres just one problem with it
 only one
 well lets start with one
and you say you have the most upgraded chip there is
why arent there soldiers or spies kicking down the doors
to my place times ticking
 not a girlfriend
just someone from the business conference
last minute meeting i suppose
well to answer your question
my chip was temporarily blocked
thats why they cant track me
or enact any protocols right now
oh so out of all the recruits
only yours was blocked
sounds convenient  it wasnt
soon after my chip was implanted
i met an agent a real one
or rather she met me
 i apparently no longer drink
 thanks to the chip i presume
none of it good for you or the country
something the doctor and vivian forgot to mention to me
or the others
the effects on your brain would be catastrophic
 why are you telling me this
 we have common interests
im not even supposed to know about your existence
until tomorrow when the doctor provides me
with a demonstration of your talents
 then how do you
 former employee of your new bosses
suddenly grew a conscience
she also provided me with an access code
 they can track me
 not yet when they fully activate your chip tomorrow
that is until their techs figure out
that we change the access codes
 what you do best you serve your country
and eliminate the threat
 abort
its not working
before i sent out the suggestions
was buy myself some more time
ever since trying to crack the problem
 anything  soon
 you use this
itll damage the chip
and fry his brain
 something like that
 so who takes out creepy uncle benson
you  no
to your story
i need a little help with the happy ending
i bet you do
 but fortunately you already helped
 senator bensons up in your hotel room
 thats why youre here
 one thats conveniently near this hotel
 theres my favorite girl
ive never even heard of senator benson
 oh hes hard to forget
 you lost a shoe
 i think you prefer the term super spy
 oh right right
 as agent wilds put it
the chip does a lot more
none of it good for you or the country
 what
a memory block doesnt seem too crazy
now youre saying im one of the doctors subjects
oh my goodness an expense account why not use it
get some food maybe a drink
and then go to sleep
 youre one of bensons crows jane
this has been very entertaining
and probably one of the most surreal nights of my life
assuming there really is one connected to these keys
you deserve it
 right well its getting late
and i have to go find the woman
i was supposed to meet here tonight
 the one from your business conference
you know this because youre super smart
because sarah wilds was never gonna come here
 i never told you who i was meeting
how do you know her name
all right im leaving
drinking some wine and going to bed
 goodbye john
 ladies room
thanks
just a story
 mm theres a lot of those around
 right
 whenever youre ready
maybe i have a shot with you yet
had better pick up skills than you do
 ouch
you know the doctor would never let us go jane
not until the next upgrade
 you see ketrovs body out there
its pretty damaged
 not everything i bought myself some more time
 im glad use it wisely
 i plan to
i need a car
 have fun mr doe
in this beautiful hotel bar
 no your lamborghini is stolen
she already did it
you and i are the only ones left
 dont worry shes not touching you
when i hacked the system
send them a memo request it back
 all the programs financiers are dead
you think youve won now
who wants more power over other people
but the chip program begins and ends with dr cain
hes the final target
 let the agency keep the tablet john
i already cracked your codes and made new ones
done
 not all of us
 ohuh
 theres no good luck
only good planning
 you sound like dr cain
 not for long
 okay
 oh hello vivian
came to pick me up at another bar
 we were dead the moment that doctor put that chip
 but we dont wanna kill you
doctor will never let you go
not until the next upgrade
 hes all yours
 good night john
 good luck jane
 let us begin again
 brain activity minimal
the damage done to the cerebral cortex is catastrophic
hes not going anywhere ever
 good
guess he was right
 he even got into your bed
why keep him alive at all
and that data
i can use to create the ultimate upgrade version
 theres always more money to be found
 and more subjects
what were john does last words
 he wished me good luck
theres only good planning
 exactly
john sent me a suggestion
 no mine was to kill the chip program
 but youre gonna be just fine just fine 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 gotta know the way youre living living 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 destiny and our games and only one saying 
 whatever you won the race 
 all together in the zone 
 where is home 
 the missions condition 
 to what is gone 
 but youre gonna be just fine just fine 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 gotta know the way youre living living 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 break it down upside upside 
 in this tangled web we weave 
 pulling strings and make believe 
 but youre gonna be just fine just fine 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 gotta know the way youre living living 
 but were winning on the upside upside 
 break it down upside upside 
 break it down upside upside

mussolini is building a powerful weapon
he wants to win the upcoming war

a few weeks ago we found a little box like yours
the fascists were looking everywhere for it
its an object that can contain a lot of information
yeah right
we grabbed some clothes
 that looks like shit  ill find you something
max what are you up to
their bodies were never found
do you think they used the machine
that the phone belongs to
if they did that means
going somewhere
those fascists you work with are the criminals
theyre huge
you cant call those who feed you criminals
i thought there was a war
what about h
hitler

he is an inventor
go on
so theres this plane crash and you fall into the sea
 and down below  you fall
it depends whos playing
but you fall in the sea and theres an underwater city called rapture
that this guy built
you die
but youre born again
you start the game over again you redo the missions until you win

hey no leave him alone
the committee was right
you are a crazy old woman
the past is now my present
i also said
science department
is that it
what stage is the machine at
there are still a few adjustments to be made
but with the latest modifications
id say it is greatly improved
the regime has assigned her a stateoftheart laboratory
come on get to work
now thanks to that code chronos can be completed
it contained the data of the electromagnet force used for the first journey
by using it as a point of reference
and equating it to the coordinates of our arrival
she can now build a timespace tracker
a what
so you didnt know where youd end up
no
come here
mr frodo

you need to try harder
or your dead companions will be disappointed
youre alive
easy easy
quick
what took you so long
lets get out of here
oh my god
havent you ever seen a time travel movie
we came from here but now were here
and this is the timeline if something changes here now
and the one we came from will be completely wiped out
if mussolini wins the war it will change history
are you saying that
that dear lena is what we call a spoiler
so this spoiler is a good thing
no
according to my calculations
and hand chronos over to mussolini
wheres this weapon being built
at the new national research council science department
 i dont follow you  hes talking about my father

traveling
in time and space is a bit like going underwater
the seabed is the past
because theres a limit
a limit

and what happens if you stay too long in the past
you drown
not you
that makes no sense were both here
i know
beo
beo tell me this is
beo i beg you tell me its all bullshit
its a huge pile of bullshit
we fucked up by coming here
basically we have to save the world

they slaughtered my friends like dogs
lena
it took you long enough to open the door smith

vulcan

ill be honest with you smith
and do you know why
because it makes people lazy
and deprives them of their greatest virtue
strength
i dont know take gunpowder for example
theres no physical clash theres no strategy theres no
training
just
we are looking for a group of antifascist kids
let me go
all right

once we were men of honor

youre a smith
and a smith cannot answer back to a general
lets go
this way
grab the kids
theyre always having punchups
dad
alone
and you dont get that im not alone
we cant take the above roads
 the above roads  well go underneath
if we go through these pipes
we can come out at this point
under the building theres a hatch here that only opens from the inside
we need someone to get to the other side
then the others can enter from there
someone has to get in to ensure the others can
and how do they get in
it can be reached from here through this pipe
we need someone skinny
ill go
right
if there was only someone here with the strength to fight always
tourists
youre the kind within the photos
greta is
greta
but meeting greta has given me an idea
that one day this will end

its really hard letting go
to protect the diversity of species
that we have right here in this bay
this diversity tell us about it
what threatens it
i live on the bay so ive seen whats going on
your mum still banging on in there
im up next
thats how it works
she speaks and then i get
fair enough dont you think
you and your mum really think you can stop this
 dont you  yeah
thats not how it works
you see governments they pay attention to shortterm gains
they need to get reelected
ill vote
to stop them
to stop you
i mean as far as im concerned
thats just stealing from
stealing from our future
my name is abby jackson
hello abby
this here is a redlip morwong
and there are three different types of these seadragons
three
and each and every one of them
and we have larger fish
like the western blue groper

as havens from the weather along the coastline
these pictures show us the many species unique to this bay
documented for the first time
i mean its a gift to us all
well we all welcome your work abby

he just wanted to play mum
i was running out of air
well
 well  well i hit him one
dont laugh ok
 its not funny  oh god
oh get on the boat come on
with the spear guns and the fact that that kid
was nearly killed by one of your blokes
so whats gonna happen now
set by their licence
arent typically used for fishing abalone
is is reckless endangerment
and today
 howd it go after i left  well
there was one though
yeah
it was you that did it abby
not me
it was your pictures
your research
just one vote
oh
just one for now
then another
then another
theyre here
wheres dora

thank you
humpbacks
patient as ever

i truly believed he would have shared
come on
when you were born
and lowered you gently into the waves
jack and me
we come from water
well you saved him abby
thats the main thing
you ever notice that just before the sun sets
beyond the horizon
the sun burns even brighter just for an instant
lights up the whole sky
yeah it does
one last beautiful hurrah
then its gone
looking out across her beloved bay
to celebrate the life of dora jackson
dora devoted her life
a safe place at last
she wanted more of them other havens along the coast
she was content with everything she had achieved
and as we say farewell to our dear friend
i thought id play a very special song
for fearless dora
thanks briggs
no worries
i love you
abby
gitundu you would not believe it here
my mums marine reserve is thriving
i saw a huge pod of humpback whales
every day there are whales off the shore
and its beautiful
great
where do you want to begin
 lets start right here  yep
take a good close look at what were fighting for
amazing well be there
thanks gitundu
i love the violin
the hardest things in my life is probably my familys health
like everybody is always getting sick backtoback
like oh we have to go to the hospital for them and stuff
i just have to get these medicine for them
you know i can understand but its like its like okay
like i guess ill play by myself
dont even jinx me with that laughs
supervisor lets see
theres four departments
theres uh brass repair string instrument repair
uh woodwind instrument repair
and piano shop
with the strings uh
please uh repair as needed
so in this case old peg has to be removed
and instrument goes back to student
and if you leave a crack open the instrument buzzes
it can be really frustrating
its hard to find that last little buzz in the cello
some of em come from a place of love and support
the emotional broken things
and the mental broken things are more difficult
you cant glue that back together
that takes time
it was 1975
you have to remember that this was a different time
so from 13 years on i tried uh my best to not be
and i thought i was broken
that buzz in the cello
or just kill myself you know
and my mom taught me
and if you stop theres no music
whatever you do dont stop
keep going
persist
you know
i wasnt broken
dont need fixing
met my husband we became dads
and weve been a couple for almost 23 years now
and so im still here
alive
free to be kind be loving be authentic
so chuckles
but we try to make at least the
the playingoftheinstrument part as good as it can be
id be playing sousaphone
giggles i dont know how to play anything
like in my home in my neighborhood we could never afford it in my opinion
and theyd always tell me the same thing
which means either a tuba or you in the house
and im just like oh giggles well
but luckily i had a sousaphone at home from school
its emotional cause like when you think about like
and ima find a way to somehow make music my career
my passion my living
give a sonic wash
i have a big jar
i call it the treasure jar
and its all the stuff i have found inside the instruments
batteries marbles candies
pencils erasers
its tiny about this big and its all hairy
its like secret communication between the kid and myself
what kind of story that instrument can tell me
my story it was a big adventure
big scary adventure
i was born in mexico in a town called morelia
you are smart youre strong
go fight for what you want
since i was little girl i wanted the american dream
so i decide i wanna go to united states
when you set your mind on doing something you do it
we travel all night
my jaw was dropped
so like wow its even better in life than what i was imagining
my daughter was three and my son was six
i start working at music store in thousand oaks
one week
and preparing the musical instruments for him to get em fixed
so after a week he say you know what
my son he said mom i would like to try clarinet
twenty dollars a month the rental
i was i was single mom remember
and i couldnt afford it
we were so poor
this is not american dream
few years later
an opportunity opened in lausd
you need to go there
there were 12 men and myself
i was scared
but i remember my mother
youre smart youre strong
go fight for what you want
if everything go okay
the test was the most difficult experience
the pistons they need to go up and down
the casing and the piston have to lock inside with a little guide
and they fit like a glove
any little dent any little scratch even if it is dirty
it wont play
i did the test
and i went home
i didnt even want to wait for lausd to give me the results
because i was almost sure that i wasnt gonna get it
i thought like put that behind me and dont get excited or anything
because smacks lips its not gonna happen
yeah
and then i get a phone call
when i saw my kids that night
it was like yes we did it
yes
same bench i never change
music changed my life for sure for sure it did
my school gave me my saxophone they gave me a case
they gave me everything i needed
this is a beauty
and always messing up
the saxophone helped me in a way be more disciplined
i have to shower
when im feeling tense when im feeling sad or angry
the saxophone
calms me down
supervisor with the woodwinds um we have a saxophone
so on and so forth gsharp key completely fell off
complete overhaul
duane ah lets see
they all got keys and screws and rods and springs
its kinda almost like a puzzle when ya find a leak you fix it
you might have to take the instrument apart just to get that one pad just right
that one instrument could change their whole life
came from the old frankenstein movie
where frankenstein was out in the woods
and he was in the woods trying to run away
that always stuck with me because growing up got picked on so much
i dont know what they thought really i was kinda in my own world
yeah
inhales yeah
so when i saw that spot in the movie
where the old blind gentleman who lived out in the woods
and frankenstein hears it
and he follows it
im goin wow the bow is going across the strings
that was such an impression on me
and then years go by and i was at a swap meet
and i saw a violin sitting there that somebody was selling
i looked at it and he said he wanted 20 for it
i think i only had five dollars
so i hitchhiked all the way back home
then my mom i begged her
went back there ran down the aisle
went around the other aisle and there it was
beautiful like limegreen felt on the inside
and from that moment on i had the fiddle bug
in high school i took every music class i could
all the other classes were just complete torture
fiddle and the banjo
bam we named ourselves after bodie ghost town
the bodie mountain express
so we came in a music store we say were a band
were looking for a place to play get some tips
oh you guys play
hey get out your instruments and play some
we had these silly hillbilly band routines
the banjo player you know did the funny thing with his eyes
and out comes this guy
colonel tom parker elvis presleys manager
and of course colonel parker is friends with liberace frank sinatra
next thing you know were gonna go to franks house
and were gonna play a little concert for him
were gonna go to liberaces house and play a little concert
an8at pontiac dome stadium the colonel put us on the elvis show
performer gonna feature mr duane michaels
were all wearing overalls and
and everybody waiting to see elvis looking like who are these hillbillies
a few years after that they hired us to play at knotts berry farm
and just hired us on the spot
the only thing is we need you in florida at disney world
sure
the colonel we had a close relationship
that 20 fiddle i found at a swap meet has taken me all over the world
by the way were the bodie mountain express
duane and that brings us to where im at now
the fact that the kids have a chance to play instruments if they cant afford it
could change their whole life
twinkle twinkle little star on the piano
im getting emotional
ive just been playing for a while playing for a long time
mental health is something thats like very hard to manage sometimes
especially with everything thats going on in your life
like school and thinking of what you want to be
like im scared like i wont like find a purpose in life
when you play onstage you have like this overwhelming presence
and like you know the audience is like somewhat like
and you feel a certain power
something like that giggles
supervisor pianos
interesting here
as supervisor i have to make sure
that all instruments are repaired in a timely manner
that shop is all up to the safety and all the employees are happy
because we are a family here
im a supervisor here
i always remember the first time i saw a piano
i was a little armenian boy and living in baku city
of former soviet union republic of azerbaijan
and i was sitting at the first row
and he had to do every single one
so many parts how does he do that
wow
he bought a guitar
and he told me not to touch it
and he comes home who touched my guitar i told you not to touch it
i said well i just played a little bit
my brother realized that i wasnt just uh touching a guitar
and he gave me the guitar
uh it was 1987
they start kicking all the armenians out
day by day it was becoming difficult
we would gather together outside of our buildings on the streets
but day by day theres less and less and less people with us
because people are moving out
theyre afraid to stay
my dad was optimistic because steve im not moving anywhere
i never harmed anybody i never did anything bad to anybody
our government will never let anything like that to happen
that he didnt listen
he was at work and somebody just came from behind and killed him
whispers sorry
samson
thats my sons name
so we just pretty much locked the doors
the guitar
it wasnt easy even to get to airport because we still look like armenian
and on the street people can stop you and harm you
so thanks to my friends azerbaijani friends
they took us to airport
an8and uh they basically created a human corridor
in airport so we can go through it
when we arrived in united states they found a sponsor ken and veronica
and show it to ken
he tried to tell me through dictionary but he couldnt find the right words
but he had this picture
beautiful painting on his wall above his piano
an8the artist is norman rockwell
so he pointed at that picture
at the school in the classroom
and i went oh god is it possible that he tunes pianos
and we started laughing
and he says would you like to help me around the piano shop
youre starting tomorrow
i said pfft yes
then of course ken would send me to yamaha schools
to baldwin schools to steinway school
after what happened in the past i lost the urge to follow the music
to be in the music to stay with the music
but life brought me back to it
ended up being a piano tuner
i mean see how life is
i love the violin
dana i think a lot of people see a broken thing
could be anything
maybe its public schools
dana but when we see a broken thing
we think oh with a little something here a little something there
paty its difficult work
but no matter what
it is one of the best things that humans do
thats why this is not just a musical instrument repair shop
when an instrument breaks theres a student without an instrument
no no no not in our city
even if they dont know me
im part of that
ive been dreaming about this day forever
look i wanted to show you the church
oh zhenya its so beautiful
i bet you wore the most beautiful dress at your own wedding
i didnt have a wedding

do you have a friend getting married soon
lola you have to find one
one whose love is very strong
trust me you dont want to trick them
throw the salt in four directions

if you lied to me and your love is fake
the spirits wont forgive you
if he loves you hell come back
cast it until the meats spoiled
youll be bound by blood
unless you change your mind
 mamas gonna buy you a mockingbird

marriage is something that sticks with you right vit
her husband died today
zhenya mom how is polina
yeah
thanks love you too
but i cast a spell
you and sonya seemed like the perfect couple
everything was supposed to work out
but our feelings werent true thats why it went wrong
it turned out to be a nightmare
he feeds on pure love but he was tricked
you see your love wasnt true
i want to fix this
there must be a way right
some mistakes can only be fixed in death
coming was a mistake
i dont know how to fix this myself but you can ask
are you always like this doctor
why did you marry that girl
then why are you here
enter when the time comes
close your eyes
no sudden movements
lola master are you here
low male voice im here come
why are you hunting this woman
what do you need from her
her soul
she promised it to me
the first candle my soul
the second
do you understand what you did
you came to someones wedding you ruined it
kirill died because of you
i dont wanna be involved in this
im sorry
oleg why are you here
go away
sonya you dont love him
 we need to talk  oleg please dont
this is nonsense
give us a minute
please
woman you cant reverse the spell
your marriage is blessed by the devil
my daughter is reckless
she has made many mistakes
and owes the spirits a great debt
she thought she could pay them off with pure love
but she failed
but even he can be tricked
you know i thought that if we got married
it would have been the right thing
to settle down have a family like its usually done
you never loved me either
i guess
we were caught in this untrue love
not the wedding
not a spell
woman if love wasnt true
but they all have to come of their own free will
sonya i wont help her
in some way were also guilty
i think its the time to fix it all everything
you know what you fix it
you do it
thank you oleg
you okay
has everyone come here by their own free will
the ceremony will be performed only
the spirits dont like to be tricked
the liar shall pay for their mistake
the first candle release my soul

so
internet celebrities
look this is my understanding

thank you mrs chen why are you thanking her
she said that im handsome
you didnt hear the first part im not finished
to tell you both the reason you didnt do well last year
then you broke up
chen chen in particular
didnt you both come back to school
to get into a good college
you cant break up we wont
you absolutely cannot break up this year
this is so sour
what were you doing
zheng yuxing got into the top class with such bad grades
he must be from a good family
as a girl
after going to a good college and finding a good job
you still need to marry well
not necessarily
when i was young your grandparents were
adamantly against your dad and me being together
since he doesnt come from a good family
and i ended up marrying him
i wouldnt go that far
so
sweet so sweet
you two have been together since high school
and youre each others first love
despite all obstacles you still stayed together until the end
how nice
thats why ive thought it through
at least until the exam
zheng yuxings grades are so bad
to end up together

fine
youre not your mom how would you know
are you sure of course that…
youre not her how do you know
my parents have been together ever since school
and theyre each others first love
i think this is how love should be
what
nothing
no
do you think that since ive never dated my opinion doesnt matter
come on
actually i didnt dare tell chen chen
is that i have no other choice
a type of faith
that keeps me going
if i stop believing it
be meaningless
does that make sense
regarding that
i have no comment
forget it
okay playing your personalized radio station
louder
turn it all the way up
im sure
hey

you should know how you did

britney britney britney
britney britney britney
britney britney britney
britney britney britney
britney britney britney
britney britney britney
when i was 8 my mom realized i could sing
ive always wanted to sing
its just something ive always wanted to do
its not just luck everybody needs a little bit of luck
everything about her was strong and fearless
i mean there was no stopping her
and it was clear she was having a crisis
what began as temporary control over her life
they felt they had to do it to protect britney
she doesnt have basic human rights
she cant write a check or have a credit card
if she doesnt behave she loses custody of her kids
i just want my life back and its been 13 years and its enough
all right so lets do our least favorite thing in the world
which just means calling random strangers and saying
im directing a project about britney
hey this is jenny eliscu
im not sure if you remember me from uh years ago
we met when i was working on a rolling stone article about britney
the movie was going to be about her artistry and the media portrayal
and can someone say wow to those dance moves
full of conspiracy and rumors
and no one would talk
i was 10 when britney came on the scene
i was obsessed
britney britney
britney had a work ethic like none other
but shes never been motivated by money
she just was doing something she loved
 im a slave for you 
the best thing about being famous is knowing that financially
ill be able to support my family no matter what
britney spears
hit after hit
then suddenly britney stopped making music
she fell in love with a backup dancer kevin federline
they got married and quickly had two children
but two years later the marriage was over and britney had filed for divorce
britney spears is leaving kfed
confetti
now hopefully with her divorce almost finalized
was really the end
the very first time i was assigned britney
i was working for an agency okay
when she comes out follow her
i excelled and i learned the job real quick
theres nothing sexier than waking up and they say
male female actor singer sports celebrity
so as a photographer
britney was relentlessly chased by the paparazzi
beautiful
one night the agency calls me
and tells me the gas station that britneys at
at the gas station everyones taking pictures
she was having problems with the gas
i asked britney can i help you
so i start doing it
and then one day a photographer calls me and says britneys asking for you
then another photographer calls me who doesnt know the first photographer
she felt better if i was present she felt safer
those are her words not mine
wheres adnan
hes off
hes out today
ill let him know
it was a very simple very easy relationship you know
oh my lord
we didnt have that balance
there was this multimillionaire and me
that if anything happens to her
when youre going through a child custody case
hi adnan how are you
what was apparent to me during this divorce with kevin
not mom not dad not friends not her sister
anybody
and thats a very scary dark place to be
the hearing this afternoon had to do with a continued interim
or temporary order
that was based on mr federlines original request to modify custody
what many thought would be a simple case guided by a strong prenuptial agreement
ironclad prenups a little bit like the titanic could never sink
for every ironclad prenup theres a group of attorneys out there
mark vincent kaplan hes the kfed lawyer
you might call in a contentious divorce custody case
he seemed to love being the spokesperson
for this highprofile divorce and custody case
and he definitely has a flair for making a public statement
how safe are the children
the kids become just pawns
risks that would otherwise be constantly visited upon them
that is relevant to their best interest
all of those things are true
id represented highprofile people and celebrities before
but this was an order of magnitude far different than anything id experienced
kevin had been treated pretty unfairly
whyd you think that was
she was americas sweetheart and in many respects she still is
and they saw kevin as someone who in their view whoever their is
the press was brutal
but as the case progressed
um i think she did certain things
the media focused less on her music
by fall of 2007
i dont know how long the estrangements were where
whether there was maybe sporadic communication
having a fear that her family would barge in
i think is how it was put and take everything
who is sam lutfi
there was a lot of controversy around sam lutfi
and what role he played in this brief period of britneys life
first question can you please introduce yourself to us
 uh im sam lutfi  and who are you
im britney spearss former manager
in that time period he went from being the sometimes friend
to somebody calling the shots
she was very funny
uh we had a great conversation
she asked for my phone number
i need your help
hey guys just be careful
just clear this side for a second
and my question to her the whole time was
theres nothing like having your mom around
we would talk about lynne
and how was her father jamie involved
not at all
uh from what i believe its been years
 its britney bitch 
the album was blackout and it sold in the millions
of what had become the story of britneys real life
a woman hunted and often on the run
this would foreshadow a much darker turn for britney
there are paparazzi images of britney in 2007
meltdown or rock bottom
a person who needed help
throughout that year paparazzi continued to follow britney aggressively
shes crazy
oh my god
something terrible could happen
you know and i fucking hate that word
or would you say she was hurt
id choose all of them before id choose crazy
in january 2008 police were called to britneys residence
she had locked herself in a room
at the court appointed time
listen up
cedar sinai this is their property
including the sidewalk that you are standing on
when we were on tour
i mean she and lynne talked at least
oh gosh at the very least two or three times a day
okay i dont wanna talk about her daddy i dont wanna talk about jamie
um
jamie wasnt with us very often hardly ever
um so it really was me and lynne
a few days after britney was released from the hospital
her name was louise taylor
what i would like to say is that
what they dont know about jamie and lynne spears is that every day
asking the lord to give him the strength to honor the people he works for
she loves her daughter so much
and again asking every day for god to give her strength
would be interceding for this family because jamie spears
lynne spears bryan and jamie lynn spears
are all amazing people
who is lou taylor
i will not touch that one
sorry
the custody suit grew more contentious
mr spears whats going on hows britney doing
can you give us any word any news on britney
for a new legal arrangement
it was called a conservatorship
i didnt give a shit about britney spears or pop music personally
its not something i paid attention to at all
then i met her and she was just so likable and sweet
so in late 2008 when i was assigned to do another cover story
and you know went to la
and she would say oh you know we know britney loves you
but we just the conservatorship weve got to
and giving them to some third party aka their conservator
or in other states its the guardian
obviously any process to deprive someone of those liberties
some people have called conservatorship tantamount to a civil death
theres conservatorship of the person
related to your personal affairs
they lose the ability to decide anything related to their healthcare
so their ability to provide or withhold informed consent
for treatments including drugs is taken away from them
and in many cases they lose their right
they lose their right to communicate with people of their choosing
theyre no longer in charge of their money
you had jamie who had bankruptcy issues
and financial mismanagement of his own life
and they said we have andrew wallet here as the coconservator
and has a fiduciary interest
but in court documents
he talked about the conservatorship as being a hybrid business model
according to the papers filed with the court on february 6 2008
they can enter and take possession of her house kick people out
they can use britneys money to pay attorneys for matters
and met him and worked with him
and even had positive experiences with him
where they felt they needed to keep away certain people
and he was like the bouncer he could keep people out
here weve got
larry rudolph britneys longtime manager
but uh in april of 2007 britney fired him
larry was the main person that jamie spears brought back
louise taylor aka lou led business decisions at times
louise taylors husband rob taylor
before the conservatorship
and we know this because there is paparazzi footage of her
with britneys father jamie
and then she somehow managed to become britneys business manager
lou taylor through her attorney charles harder
the letter was extensive
when i got this notice i was alarmed
was not unusual for people involved in the story
while lous involvement with britney wasnt clear
this is paperwork relating to britneys condition
because its orders related to dementia placement
you dont usually see dementia mentioned with you know with a young person
because when someone is being made a conservatee
they have time to do that
the only reason given for depriving britney of five days notice
is that sam lutfi is dangerous and needs to be kept away
dont push dont push
get off off off
it was total crisis mode with sam
and that is something that i dont believe has really been portrayed correctly
is the level of crisis
oh my god please get the out of the way
get out get out get out thank you
they felt they had to do it to protect britney from sam
that something dangerous was happening with sam
what do you think was going to happen
he was crushing drugs and putting them in her food
drive my car thats what i got to do
you have a hundred blood tests and drug tests
the entire time i was with her she passed every single one of them
no one called the police
that youre drugging the worlds biggest star you call the police
i was just an expendable guy
she would have obviously contested it they knew that everyone knew that
sam would later sue lynne spears britneys mom
as i am told they both entered the restaurant
and britney sort of did an aboutface
uh she called me and said that she needed help
we called adam
we were chased probably by i dont know 50 75 vehicles
cause we had helicopters swirling over the building
there must have been a hundred paparazzi
i sent down my secretary
who brought a guy from the mailroom
to help britney get up from the garage to my office
yes
just follow me
my secretary dolores gameros
whos like 54 was elbowing everybody out of the way
dont kick me
but i can tell you what i told the court
so we walk into court and i said
she wants an independent to be the conservator
she clearly understood the concept of a conservatorship
its inappropriate to have a family member as the conservator
as the conservator
and the reason is that family relationships are always complex
when i told the judge what britney wanted
the judge looked at me and said
so im sorry mr streisand
can you give us a headsup on what happened here today
no im sorry
 ive talked to the press  hows britney
theres no law that says that conservatees
have the right to the attorney of their choice
they have whats called this volunteer panel of lawyers
doesnt mean theyre working for free far from it
but they volunteer to get appointed by the court
to represent people like britney
i cant tell you what happened in court after i left
who was appointed as her lawyer argued the way that i argued
that the conservator shouldnt be britneys father
ive got my suspicions
i sure hope sam ingham fought hard against uh against it
but i never heard that he did
we have very particular standards for conservatorship
ive represented dozens of conservatees in court
not one of them has ever had a job
nope she no longer has rights or say over anything
i watched her write the blackout album on a starbucks napkin
on ventura boulevard in studio city
i watched her sit there and put the moves together
what colors to use and you know the scenery
that her fathers gonna get a conservatorship
it didnt make sense to me
im from in touch magazine
let me give you a fucking clue i dont talk to nofuckingbody
why dont you talk to us
cause i never have to talk to anybody you dumb fuck
the source said
this is a confidential report only a select few have access
most doctors and other professionals
have not been publicly connected to the case
and would like to remain that way
the report was produced by a doctor that resigned from the case in 2013
britney spears lacks capacity to retain and direct counsel
her own financial affairs without being subject to undue influence
whats wild is at the same time this report was written
britney was back to work
sir please dont yell at me because when people yell at me
the episode was out within two months of the conservatorship starting
yet we have paperwork that says she had dementia
how is someone who is that ill well enough to go to work
caution should also be exercised
so as not to accelerate her return to work
the medical team said that britney lacked capacity
but who was the original doctor that made that decision
there was only one name listed in the initial evaluation
a dr j edward spar
were ready for slate
and what the justification was
dr james uh
take one mark
thank you
dr spar tell me about your work
i am a retired uh geriatric psychiatrist
and still do the occasional consultation for attorneys
had you heard of britney spears music before you met her
 wait before i met her  yeah
oh wait im not going to acknowledge that ive ever met her
well im a geriatric psychiatrist
so thats one of the things that geriatric psychiatrists
so here is a court document
okay again show me my signed declaration
whether anybody ever retained me to see anybody not just britney spears
these are confidential evaluations
that conservatorships are um mostly to help people
the ones where i have been involved
the person whos filing for the conservatorship
usually most of the cases ive been involved in
what theyre trying to protect them from
is a predatory individual after that persons money
i get a phone call from her father
and he said no you need to bring her home now
for me to pull up at the gates
and theyre standing there and she freaks out
what are they doing here why are they here
and she looks at me
im supposed to be the one that protects her
and its that real
she just looks she doesnt talk anymore shes completely silent
thats when the realization was
okay i dont think things are gonna be the same
as 2008 continued britney had reportedly negotiated
5050 custody of her kids
and work she did
it started with recording a new album
this mtv film would be called for the record
this was a new time in britneys professional life
and people who were sort of from the outside
and realizing that like there wasnt a single person
that was involved with that project
like not a single person
and all that kind of stuff
its like its bad
im sad
and uh keeping her busy you know like me i like to go fishing
she likes to sing and dance she likes to work
are they gonna bring something here or something
 except me  except you
is that my car
i was there that day and i remember
thirty people have to arrange this whole thing
to let her drive her car to feel free for 30 minutes
like in what context
the whole thing is fucked up im sorry
britney and i had become close
there were times shed ask me for help
whether it was questions about legal issues
or you know stuff about conservatorships
um and i would usually try and deflect these things
this people article came out
and there was stuff she didnt really agree with
and as for kevin saying britney divorced him
and he wouldnt see her and the children
and her lawyer said if she doesnt divorce him hes gonna do it himself
so kevin trying to play the innocent victim is hardly irrelevant
he left her and the babies
her children were taken away and she did spin out of control
this year britneys been silenced to speak out about anything thats going on
she would love for new eyes to see her situation
as long as the people are getting paid and she has no rights
britneys given her brother a 2 million apartment
her mother an estate in louisiana
and her father the best job in show business
shes a very giving person and would love to get the respect she deserves
it was an emotional response to the article coming out
but like trying to use my phone to call people
but you had enough foresight to copy the letter
i mean again like i always just felt bad for her
how much longer did you work with britney after that
um
and maybe we were too close at that point
i actually i dont think ive spoken to her since
and britney had met a bunch of my friends
and we had kept in touch even after it came out
then he told me about the fact that he and adnan had been trying
to come up with a plan to help her find a different lawyer
she still in january of 2009
still wanted a different lawyer if she could get one
this was a full year of the conservatorship
supposedly having saved her life
they had been talking to different lawyers
who thought that if they could get her to sign this document
saying why she wanted a new lawyer and why she wanted the specific lawyer
and there would be no way to refute it
at that time sam and adnan were persona non grata
i cant say there was a specific moment that convinced me to do it
of course i was concerned about being a participant in the story
i was trying to cover objectively
but at that point i had known britney spears for a decade almost
that i could be more useful as a good samaritan almost
anything to say about the conservatorship today
and she would know to come meet me in the bathroom
i just walked in thinking pretend im a guest
and then went into this small bathroom
and saw her tattoo on her foot or ankle or whatever it is
and she signed and looked at me and said thank you
and i said
and we thought that when he sees that she signed it
hell know that things are gonna change
that it was all over and that similar to what had happened with adam streisand
and still no one really talks about the fact
but someone else knew about the incident at the montage
the courtappointed lawyer for the conservatorship sam ingham
stated that britney told him shed met with a reporter
and asked him to do whatever is necessary to squash the document
she further stated that she was
fully satisfied with my representation of her
that same day the attorney she had tried to hire john anderson withdrew stating
it was another time that britney had tried to seek her own representation
and it failed
who is tasked with making the conservatees best case
for whatever the conservatee wants
are not representing what their clients want
keep in mind that the only way that sam ingham gets paid
obviously there is a natural tendency to say
what is your reaction to knowing that a courtappointed attorney
is making over 3 million dollars like as in this position
are you concerned for britneys mental health
by early 2009
jamie spears asked that the temporary conservatorship of his daughter
and there was a range of new specific powers and privileges
to giving him more complete control over britneys personal finances
perhaps most importantly though the permanent conservatorship
britney was preparing for a huge tour
whatever concerns the conservatorships medical team had
sales have generated about 40 million
second there seems to be an opportunity to add two shows
at the end of the us leg on very attractive financial terms
so this is before the circus tour
 but theyre adding more dates  right
they went from temporary conservatorship to permanent conservatorship
so us noting that there was financial incentives for larry for jamie
the circus tour was performed over the course of nine months
to prove that what they decided to do was the right decision
britney
britney
theres nothing relaxing about being on a tour
flying all over the world
i can only imagine how stressful and challenging that might be for her
its like thats hard
the conservatorship stated that they had successfully added
her main focus almost to the point of obsession
was getting more time with her children
her second preoccupation was whether the conservatorship would end
oh man she gets an allowance shes got privileges
thats the patriarchy
it was her agent jason trawick
he was featured in britneys music video criminal
wait
now im okay
jason was like a very smart very sweet very caring
like he was one of the guys that i would confide in
and we would talk about all that was happening
because at the time neither of us were dating her or engaged to her
or anything like that
to see the role that he transitioned into
bet you know what that means
britney
so this is from a doctor with the conservatorship to sam ingham
i found him to be forthcoming and open though fearful that whatever he said
might be held against him or place him at odds with others
his philosophy is britney will have to learn to live without a conservator
jason states inconveniences britney has to go through
for example they wanted to drive within a gated community on a golf cart
but have to ask permission each time
if they want to go out to a hamburger joint
they have to call for permission and wait 20 minutes or more for an answer
if britney needs a few hundred dollars to buy books for her kids
what the fuck
significant tensions arose between jamie spears
right and then look at this
she is especially adamant that jamie be punished
about the conservatorship itself
in a simple way she feels that if she is drug tested so should he be
if she were to suffer a great penalty like losing her kids
he should suffer an equally great penalty for his drinking
britney wants to come off the conservatorship
but mostly she wants to end the conservatorship of the person
the conservatorship has maintained britney has never once asked for it
but we have here in evidence that she wanted out of the conservatorship
that she was vocalizing that need and that it was ignored
in december 2011 britney and jason became engaged
four months later she requested jason be added as her conservator
but instead of jason replacing jamie
the court ruled in what could be considered a compromise
at the time i thought that it was interesting
with her father and fiancé as coconservators of her person
britney inked a reported 15 million deal to judge x factor
behind the scenes confidential reports given to us
showed that the conservatorship was in chaos
the medical team thought that x factor put undue pressure on britney
whereas her management said that withdrawing would be just as bad
under intense pressure from britneys management
but said there would be strict guidelines for their approval to stay in place
and then the big bombshell is that we have direct evidence
that her medication the medication that she liked to take
theres different dosages on
valued the benefits of stimulants for britneys performance
this had been the case for her tours and for her participation on x factor
by the same token jamie wanted b ritney not to take stimulants
from the publics perspective
britneys performance on the x factor was a success
less than a year later though britney and jason would break up
on the subject of x factor itself
instead her current plan is to create a las vegasstyle revue
to perform at a las vegas hotel over three or fourday weekend dates
what does it say right after that
i believe this is an appropriate career move
from the perspective of her psychiatric condition
its so hot
okay so
has been very very very profound
very little is known about britneys life during this time period
the conservatorship kept her inner circle very small
candid britney interviews were rare
when she was talking to her audience
honestly without the music just the mic it kind of feels illegal
like its quiet right now and it
it feels so weird
but i just want to make sure
when she found out i was there she wanted to see me backstage
and it was like we both just immediately just embraced and just cried
i think thats why we both broke down and cried
in the nine years ive worked for her ive never seen her smile like that
its myself felicia and a couple other people
and then the four years in vegas
i had much less contact with her
but i made sure every show she knew i was there
and then did she continue to love performing
i mean its such an intense schedule
um
im sorry
the one thing we know for sure is that britney worked almost nonstop
it would be called domination
ladies and gentlemen britney spears
when she walked dow n the red carpet
but then she didnt
three months later via instagram
britney would cancel the show citing family health concerns
that was a huge moment when the fan community began to suspect
in like weeks if not months
and cut to april 2019
ive heard from many different quarters
then throw it over an electrified fence to an unsuspecting gardener
if she wanted to get a message out as far as being held against her will
i cant even imagine the numbers of ways she can do that
so i just needed time to deal dont worry ill be back very soon
the video only increased public speculation
what was going on inside the conservatorship
and why was she in one if she was quote okay
we know that in summer of 2019
had a restraining order filed against jamie
a door was broken down one of her sons was shaken
um the restraining order was based on an unauthorized
uh lets just say it had to do with conduct
that put the children in fear of their safety
how did a door get broken
and uh it caused the door to come off the hinge or something in that regard
at the end of 2019
had lost 400000 in billing in 2019
she requested a minimum of 500000
yet it was a time when britney wasnt working
he paid the funds the next day
this is what jamie spears in july 2020
said of britney spears
why dont we do here
james p spears respectfully submits this status update
to provide information in advance of and regarding some of the topics
in the amount of 1 million
in her own financial wellbeing
mr spears has been working to establish a model
where ms spears current lifestyle can be preserved
and her needs met based solely on passive income
and this enormous cost of maintaining her lifestyle
this is a tall order
and describing her and criticizing her and limiting her
 how do you get out  i just
you dont get out until you scream
i feel like maybe id apologize
i feel like i didnt you know do enough
it just seems like it keeps getting worse
it feels like somethings gonna happen definitely somethings gonna happen
so youre in
its not playing anything
this is us trying to get into the court hearing
and 60 million fortune
going through introductions slashformalities britney says quote
i have a lot to say so bear with me
ill recap
i was on tour my management said if i dont do this
it was very threatening and scary
and with the conservatorship i couldnt even get my own attorney
so out of fear i went ahead and i did the tour
i started rehearsing early but it was hard
cause id been doing vegas for four years and i needed a break in between
i was basically directing most of the show
i taught my dancers my new choreography myself
i wasnt good i was great
he immediately the next day put me on lithium out of nowhere
compared to what i was used to
my dad was all for it
he loved every minute of it
after ive lied and told the whole world im okay and happy
its a lie
i thought maybe i said that enough maybe i might become happy
because ive been in denial ive been in shock
i am traumatized
but now im telling you the truth
im not happy i cant sleep
im so angry its insane and im depressed i cry every day
like i didnt matter
and the degree and the damage that they did to me back then
its embarrassing and demoralizing what ive been through
cause i honestly didnt think anyone would believe me
and literally watch me make a living for so many people
and be told im not good enough
but im great at what i do
britney britney britney
i feel ganged up on and i feel bullied
and i feel left out and alone
i deserve to have the same rights as anybody does
thats all i wanted to say to you
and thank you so much for letting me speak to you today
it was two of us
and the third was our fate
which i guess was upset with us and had retreated in a shell

we cannot live without you
even if weve to starve with you
if hes borrowed a loan he must return it
but he isnt refusing on returning the money sir
sir farmers are committing suicide
what can i do about it
i am not telling them to commit suicide
they keep saying they had no crops this year no profit
but since they did they must pay it back
why dont you understand
he isnt refusing to pay the loan
do you know how badly your people roughed up ramdas
ill have you thrown out
and ill set your bank on fire

guard throw them out
ill strangle you with my fingers

well deal with it
our geese is cooked
and helped you out
but today these two
and especially this one
he threatened me in my own bank
the bank has decided
then the bank will claim your lands
listen that conversation happened between us
even i am only talking prince charming
but if you manage to repay the loan in a week
how is that even possible
we didnt have a decent crop in sixmonths
thats not my problem i am leaving now
and the farmers had a setback
you have these two to help you out
take their help and repay the loan
i am leaving
manager sir listen to us
ajay who told you to go and fight with him
we didnt go there to fight kishan we went there to talk too
quiet
not a word
arent you the guy who came to my shop and was arguing with me
its in his nature
believe me
he must have abused the bank manager
i can assure you
now weve a new problem on our hands
how do we get rid of this problem now
he sent his recovery agents who were beating up ramdas at the fair
shut up beating up ramdas
pappan what diabolical duo did you bring to the village
they have ruined this village
dubey sir i am talking to them
look son things have gotten out of hand
things might have gotten out of hand but we also have six months
what can we do in 6months
farm huh
do we need your permission now to work in our fields
theres no point in getting disappointed like this sir
wait a minute you dont have to interfere
just an uninvited guests
all you can do is fight
i know your young bodys itching to fight
how dare these people enter our village
throw them out
calm down calm down
i wont do it alone were all going to do it
a person is capable of doing anything
if were capable of anything then ill become the prime minister of this country
heard what the villagechief said
if growing crops was their way out
pappan did these two loot a bank
you rebelled too soon man before required
can i say something
seeds and fertilisers will be arranged for
how
my father
he sells them at expensive rates and saves up on the seeds and fertilisers
that way
your father is a big miser jhumki dont be offended
who is going to tell him
take all you want
great
what a fruitful discussion were having
were going to steal now
i know you can do it
sameer
this is not a professional discussion either
everything is personal here
dont you see your startup here
we came here to die
came here to die
nothing hes just bantering
tell her
tell herwe came here to commit suicide
suicide
lets do one thing
you can jump in one of the wells in this village and die
theres well behind our house as well
be quiet grandma
whats all this talk about dying
then lets do one thing
and run from pillar to post in the city like us
i am trying to find a solution to a problem
and if you dont want to do it then just spare me
youre not the only one who cares about everyones pain
do it on my own
you tried talking to the manager on your own
and even to the villagers
you need a man like me even to die
ajay
youre unlucky for yourself
go away
so now i am bad luck
yes youre bad luck
you know what from now on continue with your life without this bad luck
 i will  now leave
ajay
pappanone of them got away with the loot
the other one will leave too
so mister do you have any money today or not
and wheres your friend
have mercy on us
ask those two boys to be merciful to you
theres nothing i can do
now leave
i said leave
hello
hello chief
 but please hear me out  we dont need your apology
 go away  sir
go away get lost
get lost
were already in a lot of trouble and hes trying to teach us
farm
here
youve to work for the village
if you need anything else dont hesitate to ask
okay
there must be a reason why god saved us from dying
there has to be
well only his will is important
but the question is what is his will
that other thief stole my money
why didnt you stop that thief
i cant go explaining to everyone
then tell him to go drown himself in the lake
the entire village is pretty emotional
the villagers wont understand until he doesnt die
say that again
oh god
stop jostling her
or shell get furious
right emotions she said emotions
its all about emotions
grandma you gave me a wonderful idea darling
i didnt give him anything pappan
he is lying
take his clothes off and frisk him
i can even take my clothes off for you grandma
lets go pappan
ill strip him naked
no no no
what are you saying
i cant do it ajay
kishan youre going back on your words
but this is about life and death
what if something goes wrong
just be gentle
just tell me when do i enter
please say yes brother kishan this concerns the entire village
 he said yes  great great
he has made plans to kill everyone in the village
well hang him instead
but we wont spare him
kishan kishan what are you saying
take me back down
please help him
is he really hanging him
no let me go
why are they hanging him
kishanlals doing the right thing
come on
give me one chance to talk to the villagers
shut up rascal wants to apologise now
you didnt leave any options for the villagers
check whether the ropes strong or not
dont look at me check the rope
hold him tight
the ropes here
jhumki please explain to your father
kishanlal
hang him upside down and check his weight
pull
what cruelty is this
hes strung my friend up
pappan save me
look what they did to me
i beg you
release him
look pappan this concerns the entire village
villagechief give him the orders stop him
but if you dont want to hear then let me die
 pull the rope  trying to teach us
youre the root of all their problems
because i know the root of your problems
shut up pull the rope
people are already dying in the village
why is still kishanlal is hanging him
jhumki is right lets listen to what he has to say
kishan lets hear what he has to say
kishan were not the kind of people to kill someone
lets hear him first
yes
honestly speaking the biggest problem of this village is
that all the youngsters ran off to the city
in search of jobs
how can these old people grow crops
second problem
do you
making such tall claims after putting the village in trouble
i am not making tall claims kishan
i am making a small point
or the government isnt aiding him
the biggest problem is yield
nearly 900 kilos on one hectare of land
900 kilos
did your eyes open now
3000 kilos
imagine if you can grow 3000 kilos in a single hectare
then would you need any government aid
no
land
land
we all farm on our lands
what good did that do
and it never will village chief
and you can watch the outcome
thats all
hear that
now hes also become our leader
no ones going to listen to you
who will provide us with that for a big piece of land
jhumki i think you had something to say
my father will provide everything
seeds fertilisers pesticides at half the rate
father who
now look dubey sir has promised to give us seeds and fertilisers okay
dubey sir will die if im lying
the boy sounds right
and i cant grow crops in this age
i am giving him my land
thanks bro
are you going to grow missiles on your land
 say yes  no
everyone will have to give their piece of land
because one needs all five fingers to make a closed fist
why isnt anyone raising their hands
you know what
and i was saying whats wrong if he stays alive
meaning
theres no task in this world that you cant do
this
i used to read this book on economics
you wont understand his words
because youve grown used to this
but if you dont listen to him today
its all in this book
what was he saying
seeds fertilisers pesticides tractor oil
one land one expense
one land less expense
what is my expense
no cigarette causes cancer i quit
kill him
run away run away run away
run away dont stay here
run away run away
ramayan huh
the bloody city boy
been here only a week
and youve turned him into a god
great
youre saying it yourself
listen to me carefully
go and tell them
i wont sell my goods without profit
and listen to me carefully
but i cant stand it anymore
i will support that boy stop me if you can
i am your father
stop me if you can huh
ill show you
this mans brought up a crucial point
all the youngsters of the village ran off to the city
and hes right
so he asks who is going to work in the fields
that the women of this village might be orthodox
but can equal any man in any job
sowho is with me
 listen  what happened
you guys are celebrating here while dubey has made a mess of things
well have to stop him before he wins in his plan
villagechief i was telling you
these two boys are a piece of s
good for nothing
wheres your other friend
why didnt you run too
for this girl
father
you guys gave him your lands
okay
even if i dont count my profit
where will the money come from
ajay do you have an answer
ajay
havent you thought about it
well i dont have an answer
this isnt the land of gold
at least 300000 rupees
hear that
this vehicle here is worth 60000
anyone will take it for 40000
pappan you dont even have any land
why are you contributing
then why is he giving it his all
thats nonsense
i wont take any profit
the villages reputation comes first understand
the truth is who will pay for the purchases
tell me
tell me ajay
see
and
whos going to work
these old folks
great
anyone
anybody
anyone
anyone
i dont know about you guys
well do the work
but you didnt understand
no i
and how
just like you always do
well have to make an outline
you know that every startup needs an initial investment
for our startup
my honeymoon jumped off the bridge that day
and you were right
astrology never does anyone any good
so dubey
jhumki
dont get her wrong
shes been my sound support
even went against her father for us
this is all ive left to do
no no pappan come here
start it
its working again
my country
every day is a new beginning
dwells in every heart
the name of my country alone does wonders
the name of my country alone does wonders
from the fields to the borders
from city to villages say in one synch
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
like how much waters required which fertiliser to be used
and which pesticide to be used
where do we get the best fertiliser
from cowdung
we must collect all the dung in this village
but it takes ages to turn dung into fertiliser son
then who will do it
the entire villages sitting on one sideleaving me alone
here
keys to my storehouse
take whatever you need
maneven my brains tired
youve put on weight
what put on weight
do you know what city girls do to stay fit
ive to grow dreams in this soil
turn it to gold with my hard work
weve to repay the debt of this land
weve to make it the best in the world
these words are written on the waves of ganga and jamuna
now listen water is important for our crops
but excess water can turn our crops yellow
this is nano ganesh
it runs on mobile network
its a difficult task in small lands
but it will take forever to look for worms and dead grass in this big land
plus well be ruining the crops
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
so how much do you have
kishan this is not your battle
go ramdas
you must have shut down the weighing scale
what
i see
what else
we wont sell at this rate
this is how the market fixes rate ajay
hurry up what do you want to do with it
its not your decision alone ramdas
its all the farmer
speak louder
dont go back home and hang yourself
if anyone pays you more in this market
lets not aggravate things
we cant be weak now kishan
clear it out of here
its sharbati wheat ive checked the best quality
i see
listen
even if you take this wheat back it will rot
for your best interest understand
tell me one thing
when you buy something from the market
anything like shoes clothes mobile
who decides the rate
so who will fix the rate of this crop which this farmer grew
you or the farmers
one price thats the market rate
have you lost your mind
lets go uncle
i wont give a penny
think about it
leave it leave it
the villagers believed that we shouldve sold the wheat at the market
they wouldnt have made enough to pay off their debts
sameer and i were steadfast on our decision
but on the inside we were worried too
the villagers were upset too
so this wasnt the end of the story
thunderous applause for sameer and ajay
on this show we present success stories of people
gave it a new meaning
their success story has reached an interesting twist
this saga of success will continue but it is time for a short commercial break
ajay
otherwise you wouldve never seen our faces
no papa you didnt make a mistake
no one made any mistakes
i guess it was a bad phase papa
mister your shots ready
one minute
and were hearing the success stories of sameer and ajay
so what happened next
well have to sell this wheat at the market
when youre clinging on to hope then hold on tight
we made it so far well find a way
i know
come on
come on
sir the other day you asked me what i do
i am a businessman
really
i am the manufacturer of the commodity that you export
sir here are the samples
thank you
have a look
what do you think
no agents
because
i only do business with people i know
shilpa said no to rajat
but if you want to seal this deal
so sir are we going to drink wine today
wine
champagne it is
sameer got shilpa without any auspicious timing
ladies and gentlemen
do you know that our country comes second in the world
why
why
of the farmer of our country practise collective farming
he can increase the quality of their yield to international standard
when the farmers of our country become selfreliant
thank you thank you
with our family
one more thing
the soil of our country can still yield gold
we just need to love it
lovely
keep raining on the fields like the monsoon
spread your fragrance all over the country
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
weve to repay the debt of this land
these words are written on the waves of ganga and jamuna
from the fields to the borders
from city to villages say in one synch
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds
the soil of my country yields gold and diamonds

to build a new house
before its torn down
before my father died
he invested with someone
and got cheated
that’s why i sold this house
to pay back
didnt he ask you before making decisions
before he died
we hadn’t talked for a long time
shuyan
do you remember the box
yesi do
she was already very sick then
 but to make me happy
whats your wish
of course
mom has prepared it just for you
and then she left us
every time he sobered up

but he didnt keep it once
so you said no one else
but me had celebrated your birthday

every birthday together
shuyan

for a while
she doesn’t eat spicy food now
lest it could affect her taste  in making cakes
when shes unhappy
shell drink a cup of hot chocolate
no im fine
shuyan
shuyan
but you must pull yourself together
so yuxuan got caught in the reversal
of time for making the wish
so the candles can really reverse time
right
i have no candle now
i dont know whether i can save shuyan
how
heres all my property information
and bank cards
when the time comes
please help me solve this one with the money
why
you can do it yourself
so
yuxuan has been ready
 for saving my life
author lives
 sorry i’m mistaken
come in
perhaps you could temporarily
change the experience of others
in this dream
i kept trying to change a thing
but i didnt make it at last
what did you try to change
 i tried to change someone’s fate
if yuxuan died in my place
 then it means fate is changeable
there must be a way
you
have you wondered what it would cost you
and the candles
won’t start over with the reversal of time
nothing
the candles
have run out
only two are left
 every time i lit a candle
including the first time
 once i was like you
i wanted to change everything
yes you still keep it
the candles

 all is taken down in there
keep out miss
hey you
all is taken down
miss
miss
 open the door miss  yes
please get yuxuan back

if yuxuan died in my place
then it means fate is changeable
there must be a way
have you wondered what it would cost you
are you not coming

 keep living in this world
i’d rather
id rather

a few years after an lushan rebelled against the tang
the dynastys western borders lay undefended
the tubos went on the warpath
late winter the first year of emperor daizongs reign
governor gao
abandon the fort
retreat to lushui pass
governor gao
the emperor has fled the capital
yes
his majesty is in shanzhou
the tubos have besieged changan
marshal guo ziyis army 
where are they
still in lantian
more ministers and generals have been executed
his majesty is resolute
as soon as he took the throne
he executed li fuguo and chancellor yuan
these are turbulent times
the court has sent a flurry of orders
urging your excellency to lead your army
to attack the tubo troops in the west 
and lift the siege of changan
and retreated to lushui pass
general yan wu will soon take over
but
when the court assigns blame
ill be the guilty one
bring the tubo prisoner for interrogation
you must answer truthfully
reporting
governor 
dozens of cavalry are at the camp gates
its extremely urgent
says hes an imperial envoy military inspector
military inspector
imperial envoy
go to the gates
receive them courteously
yes sir
its heavens will
take the tubo away
yes sir
get up move
governor gao
governor
inspector cheng
for not riding out to greet you
i apologise
the emperor sent me west
to ask you some questions sir
if you cover up anything sir
or are less than clear
i am authorized
ask sir
and ill say all i know
li bai
li bai li taibai
imperial scholar
calls himself green lotus hermit
li bai
youre not here about the tubos
how did you meet li bai
start from the beginning
he was
he was once my good friend
from his majesty down to peddlars
dont fear loneliness on the road ahead
for who in this world doesnt know you
ive heard that poem before
i wrote it when i was thirty
as a farewell to dong da
i was so young and ignorant
even if everyone knows you
how many count as true friends
so if li bai was once your true friend
governor
we met when we were young
i was twenty
it was near dongting lake
when he tried to kill me
im from the gao clan of bohai
the 35th boy in my generation
they called me gao thirtyfive
and made prince of bohai
my father had great expectations of me
he hoped that one day
confucius said
to practice what you learn 
but learning to read
was really difficult for me
when i looked at a book
the characters swam on the page like tadpoles
father 
fforgive me
my father was a warriorscholar
but when he died in shao guangdong
i was sixteen my mother had long passed away
i took his ashes from guangdong back to guangling
i came home to an empty house
after three years of mourning
didnt read well but i had martial skills
it was kai yuan the tangs golden age
i would go straight to changan
serve the emperor
and restore the glory of my family
i rode west from guangling
id only reached dongting lake
and my money was running out
thief
stop
damn thief youre skilled
but youre no hero up on that horse
if youre a true fighter dismount
well see who wins then
you steal my horse and bags and youre no thief
youre good at this thief
to block my sword isnt easy
but with such skill why thieve
they had saddlebags
if youre not a thief
oh a ccoincidence
okay i believe you
lend me your horse
my horse
youre quite the warrior
thank you for saving me
earlier i falsely accused you
i beg your pardon
no nneed to apologise
the law of the tang
says if a civilian meets a thief
killing him isnt a crime
otherwise i couldnt have helped you
so young and yet so formal
thank you
gao shi at yours
if i didnt catch them id never forgive myself
what youre carrying  its valuable
but this 
this is
we studied together in our youth
after i left sichuan i ran into him at mt lu
we looked for a taoist master together
but fate was cruel
three years ago he took ill and died
and bury him there
thats right
ill bury him by yellow crane tower
let that famous tower be his companion
a marvelous idea right
come brother gao 
he said his family was from longxi
he used to live in sichuan
in the hope one would recognise his talent
and commend him to the court
enjoy
brother gao 
weve got time
how you killed that thief with your spear 
id be happy
lets do it
and rely on variation
is to trick your opponent
gao shi 
when i was eighteen
i went to mt changping
to study strategy with a master zhao
theres a north sea fish
thats called the kun
thats called the eagle
li bai
he lived in this world
but seemed apart from it as well
got it
brother gao 
living in such a golden age as this
we shall be great eagles
and perch upon the jujube tree
steals the life of a good man
the great eagle never spread its wings 
o grief o sorrow
brother wu 
o grief
o sorrow
brother gao 
blink and its gone
so tragic
brother li 
brother gao 
nothing in life is easy
i want to do the hardest things
one day
but before i can do that
i must achieve official rank
brother gao 
of course
this governor loves essays
i wrote ode to the great eagle for him
hell promote me for sure
the dynasty has a system for promoting talent
officials of high rank
were responsible for recommending talent
so literati presented their best work
to get recognition
it was a shortcut to official rank
it was called passing the scroll
but
how can such shortcuts
be open to those of humble birth
the tang soldiers are terrified
youve seen that
once the tubo army arrives
yan wu
yan wu is coming back
yes you know how strong he is
we have to do this before that
the tribesman are all prepared
understood
but li bai
wouldnt open for him
brother li 
brother gao come with me
no need to wait outside
our families have no ties either
brother gao
my talent
im going
please go away
he cant see you
has he read my essay
yes
and you dare to pass the scroll
he has eyes but can not see
blind
blind
lets go brother gao
thats how i learned
by the laws of our dynasty
even a wealthy merchant belongs to the lower class
the son of a merchant
cant even take the civil service exam
cmon brother gao
to get an official position
his genius could light the dark
his brilliance was obvious
but id never met anyone
waiter come
coming
bring us your best wine
brother gao  bottoms up
brother gao come quick
see the yangtze
it flows from my hometown
endless waters countless peaks 
this river brought me here
brother gao does your home have great rivers too
bohai has the yellow river
but i know the poem upon stork tower
the sun rests on the peak before it fades
the yellow river flows towards the sea
wang zhi huans wonderful poem
waiter waiter
coming
what can i do for you sir
im overcome with inspiration
i want to dedicate a poem to yellow crane tower
of course

youre young and accomplished
who was your mentor at court
his excellency inspector eunuch gao
he was devoted to the court
but empress zhang and li fuguo smeared his name
and he died in exile
his majesty has since eliminated that cabal
i killed li fuguo myself
youre loyal to your mentor
thats rare
had no one such as yourself
people there saw the gaos
as a clan past its prime
watch it

and with no hope of an official position
what family would give me their daughters hand
im getting married
the xus of anlu

worldly prosperity is an illusion
ephemeral as a flowers bloom
all those years in yangzhou
i received terrible news from home

i
i had no idea
where i fell suddenly and terribly ill
and nearly died
that night
i think of home
im getting married
in a month ill go to anlu
and pay my respects to the xus
though my sons wont bear my surname

to get some advice
meng haoran lives in a wonderland

master cuis poem is eight lines
brother gao 
i was just overcome with inspiration
more years fled past
i decided to join the army
im awkward in company

this man leads a frontline cavalry
if you win ill give you your own cavalry
what are we competing in
wrestling

our opponents are khitans
theyre renowned wrestlers
fine lets wrestle
bravo
well done
captain gao
that whole year in jizhou
i didnt write a single poem

we found no trace of them
there over there
the khitans are burning the plains
retreat
a cavalry platoon of the right army
all soldiers mobilize
from start to finish
the next order i received
gao thirtyfive 
go home
those soldiers are off to longxi
their hair is whiter than mine
and they still cant shed their armor
like to leave a little something here

the han fight the fierce enemy far from home
the men vanquish all before them
gao shi

its the best one youve ever written
congratulations

gao thirtyfive 
these lines will live forever
brother li youre too kind
i went to anlu
later my fatherinlaw died
he pushed me aside
one day master danqiu came by
hes an old friend from home
of course
its not something that comes quickly
i could serve the tang on the frontier
guess what i discovered
an lushan
was planning a rebellion
thats a capital crime
do you have proof
this one
the tailor made a mistake
but not one of the tang
i returned the robe
but as it turned out 
i was deciding what to do
and executed
i have to find an official
everyone who tries dies
its damn useless
whos there
so whats the point of reporting
please who are you
you 
li bai gao shi 
youve heard of me
they found me
li bai come out
who are you
im guo ziyi

so its all of our business
guo ziyi your great reputation precedes you great skills
youll pay for this one day
lets go
so before the sun sets
theyre going to execute you at the inn
military discipline is harsh
today its my turn
but its wrong
heaven gave us these gifts 
when i arrived yesterday
i heard geshu han was leading his army west
theyre half a days march away
ill go plead with him
do all you can to protect brother guo
ill be back before sunset
stop the execution
so the two of you
such a talented man
shouldnt die a wrongful death
no one couldve known
brother gao
it wasnt too hard
he wanted me to work for him
i said that in the future
wherever he led his troops into battle
he just had to call for me
i still dont
i give myself ten years
ten years
was ten years ago yes
ten years
right
ill also give myself ten years
lets see if in ten years
we can make it into the court
gao shi 
hard is the journey hard is the journey
one day the wind and waves will favor me
youre back
not really i still need you
great
would spread wide and far
from then on everyone knew
that i gao shi was a poet
i could finally study on my own
but the poems fame
made the general i spoke of 
and caused all the high officials
to avoid me like the plague
a literary man
back home in shangqiu
ten years slipped past
i hope youve been well
li bai wrote to me
in ten years searching for immortality and the tao
his fame however had grown
out of the blue came an imperial summons
and he was called to changan
as a member of the hanlin academy
his majesty xuan zong believed in the tao
li bai said
by then she had converted to taoism
unworldly people
he 
he invited me to changan

why are you wearing taoist robes
these last few years in changan
the emperors precious consort hates me
changan
his majesty
to bow and scrape before the highborn
i will enter a taoist order
a taoist order
gao shi 
im not joking
once king liangs garden palace
where is he now
this terrace 
once rang with song and dance
we both had such ambition
but in the blink of an eye
here we are nearly fifty
gao shi 
life is short
master gao of beihai
has prepared a taoist altar in jinan
brother gao you may not know
brother li must ascend that altar
gao shi 
this great eagle
can no longer fly
and doesnt want to either
he said
i was his best friend
in any case
i agreed
newly ordained taoists
brother li
nothingness will be your teacher
and nature your friend
and extend your golden life
brother gao 
youre a holy man
yes
wine is part of my spiritual practice
gao shi 
in the 20 years of our acquaintance
come come
drink up
bottoms up
i cant drink anymore
that wont do
im done too
no way
master cen
master danqiu
you have to keep drinking
everyone has to drink
no one stop
i have a poem
ill revive your spirits with poetry
can you see
the yellow river decanting from the sky
and racing to the sea never to return
as dawns black silk turns to evening snow
when life goes well be joyous
never show the moon an empty cup
heaven gave me talent for a reason
tonight well drink three hundred cups at least
master cen master danqiu
drink and dont put down your cups
ill sing for you 
ancient sages leave no name
its great drinkers who enjoy great fame
wine flowed like water
hosts shouldnt fret over costs 
buy more wine and fill those cups
fine horses expensive robes 
tell the servant to sell these for wine
li bai 
youre going
perhaps we wont see each other again
if we dont 
see you in the celestial realms
as for me 
im of this world
ill linger here
li bai 
im off to the frontier to serve under geshu han
ill keep my ten year vow
your poem said it all
the yellow river racing to the sea never to return
when i face my ancestors
such lofty spirit
bravo bravo
but gao shi 
if youre going to the frontier at your age
let me test how strong you are
come
lets wrestle
sure
gao shi 
you won
go then
go then
farewell
curved swords bright as shining snow
galloping past like shooting stars
i wrote this poem 20 years ago
it was my impression of you gao shi
the living are but passersby
the ancient dust is soaked with tears
when i first got to longyou
we laid siege to stone fort
its easy to defend hard to attack
starved of supplies the tubos finally surrendered
only 600 men had defended the fort
a mere 600 defenders
kept us pacing outside its walls half a year
yunshan fort
is another stone fort
reporting
dawn
i often read his new poems
sir 
do you have many regrets in life
regrets
of course
even if i perform meritorious deeds
everyone feels in danger
among the poets i know
governor of beihai li yong
frontier life is hard but uncomplicated
ten years flew by
my life was nearing its end
in all this time
i only saw li bai once
was in xuan city on official business
whos that
magistrate wang lun is a big fan
thats li bais new wife
a few centuries worth of events occur
an lushan
had been plotting rebellion for over ten years
whod have thought that
yang guozhong took his place
an lushan
reporting
gao xian zhi and feng changqing
were both executed
the great dynasty has no generals left
im the last and im halfparalyzed
if i defy orders to fight this important battle
the court will naturally execute me too
who will succeed me
i fear itll be the eunuch inspector bian lingcheng
if i were a little younger
itd be much better
the tubos lurk about the herds
the whole army is in agreement
help me onto my horse
gao shi 
and tell the emperor
that not all northern tribes are traitors
general
go gao shi
i geshu han
wont surrender
go
tong pass had fallen
the court had fled from changan
they killed the chancellor
and made the precious consort commit suicide
some powerful and ambitious men
the world was in chaos
yangzhou six months after the fall of tong pass
the new southern region governor
and quelled the princes rebellion
gao shi southern region governor
reporting sir
sir 
reporting sir 
prince yong issued a call to all heroes
read it
that led me a lowly official of below 8th rank
within six months
governor we have news of prince yongs army
tell me
theyll arrive in three days
prince yong is a mediocrity more ambitious than wise
if he wanted to win control
it wouldnt be easy but if successful
it would change the world
how can he win the loyalty of heroes
does he have much clout
have any great men joined in his cause
but no one has answered
oh right except one poet
li bai
li bai is on prince yongs side
li bai wrote eleven whole poems for him
eleven poems
mt beigu was once a fortress of wu
the towers reflections shimmered on the water
madam li 
prince yong has been executed
i know
li bai 
i failed to advance my spiritual state
prince yong sent several emissaries
to invite me to help him
i wanted such a chance my whole life
though im old how could i refuse
you didnt know he was rebelling
rebelling
wasnt he the tangs top military officer
top military officer
you didnt realise that in such chaos
all types of men would claim the throne
but
li bai 
jiangxia
yellow crane tower
right gao shi governor gao 
jiangxia yellow crane tower
you
dont you see
just come and see this
everywhere is like jiangxia
everywhere is in ruins like yellow crane tower
madam li 
please dont worry about me
im not like my husband
ill spend my remaining years in seclusion on mt lu
take care
wife
wife
ill return to mt lu
wait for me
you didnt save li bai
you were always one step from the abyss
instead of execution exile in the southwest
is under your command
yes
the tubos have besieged changan for three months
are you afraid of repeating geshu hans mistake
when his army was annihilated outside tong pass
in old age haste leads to error
but the gossip in court has it
that you and guo ziyi
fell out over whether to save li bai
the emperor sent me here
the tubos have also heard this rumor
reporting
reporting governor
tubo troops are halfway through the valley
theyre three hours away from here
of the men at the qujiang wine shop that day
he zhizhang wang changling cui zongzhi are dead
though still alive
du fu wanders homeless
and wang wei imprisoned by the traitors
this candle
i apologise sir
but its time to take back yunshan fort
hand me my spear
this is a longforgotten old road
the steep path cant accommodate a large army
but its a shortcut
i understand
instead youre taking a step back
now those 70000 tubo soldiers
have no escape route
but governor gao lushui pass may be risky
what if they cant defend it
youre right
the man who came here was his messenger
the reinforcements are here
your excellency is famous for being straightforward
and yet you pulled off this masterful ruse
changan will be saved
as inspector gaos top disciple
youre of course a great martial artist too
that year of the rebellion
inspector gao took on the enemy singlehanded
and you are his worthy successor
governor gao 
wouldnt such a provocation be too obvious
assemble hurry
this is for changan
changan
fall into formation
gao shi  do you know how to trick your opponent
yan wu is young vigorous and brave
i take my leave
oh how is he
very good
you wanted to save li bai
your excellency i guessed right yes
i also have news of li bai
what
before the new year the emperor announced an amnesty
li bai has been pardoned
he wrote a new poem after his pardon
out from baidi amongst the colored clouds
my little boat passes by ten thousand peaks
my little boat passes by ten thousand peaks
he hadnt reached his place of exile
in this collection
whose poems do you like
who else
cui hao meng haoran wang changling are all great
cen shen too
youll understand them one day
of course
sir dont think badly of me
changan in a flood of moonlight ten thousand homely sounds
no taste
its okay
so long as the yellow crane tower poems exist
yellow crane tower is still with us
of the three hundred thousand only i returned to changan
a young soldier of changan
wang wei
li bai li taibai
changan is like a dream when might i return
changan 
changan will still be with us
li bai at your service
gao shi at yours
in winter li bai passed away
in the second year of emperor daizongs reign
of all the tang poets he had the most distinguished record of service
life is short drink till youre old

we cant send her off like this
april 3 2011
current time 1130 am
ill now begin the autopsy
hows this possible
we received a report this morning
that it was not a specific virus
there was some inflammation near the bronchus
only the alveolus
connected to the bronchial tubes were damaged
so theres a high likelihood that a foreign agent
entered the respiratory system
and i found a doctor who discovered and studied
yeah who
dr oh jonghak from jungang hospital
yes thats correct
medical journal unknown pulmonary fibrosis
yes who might you be
im jung taehoon a fellow alumnus
i hope instant coffee is okay
yes thank you
this is my son
acute pulmonary fibrosis
thats right sir
it started in 2006 or so
i thought it was common cold at first
common cold
tell me the truth
what did you do to my child
tell me
it was quite strange
had we conducted a proper epidemiologic survey
a survey was done on pulmonary fibrosis
yes but it didnt go well
what was the reason
weird thing was
only in the spring
yes spring
april medical records
this really is weird
over 80 of all cases
the rest was discovered later
but had early signs in the spring too
what for
if we conduct a survey
sender jung taehoon
 hello ms park yein  yes
what happened to the survey
did anything come up
its not easy
we didnt get a single reply
id like to ask you
baby stuff is left intact
possibility will be greater if we dig deep into it
when did your granddaughter become sick
last spring
she collapsed while training
are you all right
yes
but i can still hold on
please find the cause ms han
i feel so bad
maam
most are for common cold

korea center for disease control  prevention
if its used in a space without proper ventilation
and depending on the person
korea center for disease control  prevention
we remained faithful to conditions you provided
as we carried out the experiment
on the second week
all lab mice died
no we have found some traces of molds and germs
or phmg for short
to be precise
a massive amount was found inside the humidifier
spotless

i saw on the tv
that it prevents molds inside the humidifier
good
its got a safety certification from the government
chief prosecutor sir
please leave
fine but listen to this
sure sure
what did you say
han youngju moron stop right there
yeah its me
halting sale and seizure will be difficult
here are 2 things we know
and its possible to transmit through respiratory system
we can conclude 2 things from dr ohs data
new cases pop up in the spring
then why did their fathers not contracted the disease
so as to not disturb their pregnant wives or children
we conducted an epidemiologic survey
based on these data points
the cause was phmg
okay lets get the press release out there
cause of an unknown lung illness
and hepatitis b 20 times worse than safe level
everyone
we have led into international markets
through thick and thin
global o2
out
i believe so sir
bring him in
get the lab to send over all related files
toxicity test of spotless must be done
the main component phmg may pose danger to human body
woosik
of koreas 50 million population
over 10 million perhaps
we sold at least that much
just a few did
woosik
as the asian head
do this right
yes i understand
woosik
welcome sir
councilman
we drank too much in broad daylight
good day sir
o2 will cover your campaign
its not just about that

i havent been here in so long but it feels so comfortable
han youngju is in your team is this correct
thats right councilman
thats not proven yet
all right thats enough
where did you find a spot like this
what
how could i not act on it
of course not
i cant believe this
they really are incredible
did something happen
they lawyered up too
ryu sangmoon
you know him
and hes their hottest lawyer
isnt that a big disadvantage for us
dont worry
we can find a rightful opposition
yes
they must be after favoritism
the court and the prosecution will side with him
but if you stand on our side
but why me
do not walk away from injustice
so long as i stand here
no one can violate the law
thats what i said
send me the files first
i brought it with me just in case
not at all
i hope i didnt put you in a tough spot by asking you
it didnt work out
i knew it was a long shot
this is bad
we arent much help

maam please sign it here
did you bring your seal
please go over there
i received calls from 2030 people today
good morning
the prosecution has not shown
any sign of investigating this case
but to be honest
have you heard of the minamata incident
and took 50 years but in the end
i dont care how long it takes
i will fight those scumbags till the end
but
suing them will cost a lot of money
i really cant afford to pay
you dont need to worry
that were short on
be careful with that
august
have plenty
its really good
so good
august
jeez
what riled you up now
by the way
i see
but this is a civil case
the trial may not be held
not be held really

an american national and her child died
why did americans die here
this has to be dealt with here

good day
its a pleasure to make your acquaintance
im not sure
all rise
well now begin the combined trial of 20114725
plaintiff
defense
your honors
our main chair attorney has not arrived yet
here he comes
my sincere apologies for being late
the traffic was terrible
and 3 cochairs representing o2
my apologies for making you wait
1 million was it
we will now begin the trial
plaintiff you may begin
your honors
yes go ahead
thank you
on behalf of o2
id like to sincerely apologize to you all
but o2 is not a corporation that creates harmful products
to conduct a toxicity testing
your honors
i object your honors
by delaying this trial
a question for the defense
at current situation
but this has been in the making for a very long time
this is a list of victims who have settled
 unconditional settlement  yes thats correct
i dont know who they are but it breaks my heart
this is 100000
what do you take me for
 defense  yes your honors
when will the result for the toxicity test come out
we plan to rush it
since o2 is voluntarily settling with the victims
we will continue the trial after dr chu sungmos team
the court is adjourned
no your honors
good work
your honors please
 great job  you as well
could you elaborate
a beloved 17year old product
after the test
not at all thank you
ms han
what did you say
im going to go see
and do what
mr han hyunjong
i thought you took a lot of money
just look at you
because of my twins
and my wifes hospital bills
from family and friends
these kind folks
yeah
i sold off my twins
and settled
so dont come by anymore
thats why
this is my last warning
transition to llc has completed as of today
and current settlement rate is at 32
whats the plaintiff up to
expert who
its not an easy decision to go against o2
very well
second trial date is next week
o2 made a very dangerous product
are you trying to bargain with o2
no no dont be mistaken
bring it
this is a 5year exclusive agreement
research exclusivity agreement
between o2 and your lab for all of our testings
and this is
we will take necessary actions against you
run your tests again
okay
is there another problem
shouldnt you look into that
sorry about that
good morning please take a look
excuse me
how did it go
itll be possible
understood good work
thank you
please read this only once for us
who are you take your hands off
i thought his hose came loose
why are you in here
need a new pair of lungs for him
give me a call ill be waiting outside
if we wait any longer even that will be difficult
im sorry minwoo
i just cant agree to this
thats their strategy
i do solemnly and truly declare that the evidence i shall give
is the truth and nothing but the truth
plaintiff you may question the witness
prof jang taesung
you stated that toxicity in a chemical substance
how could it vary
toxicity of a chemical is divided
so depending on person and circumstances
it will vary
for example
but when inhaled or swallowed
it may prove very fatal to someone
yes thats correct
it is unthinkable that a poison like phmg was used
that is all
professor
as an expert in the chemistry field
yes thats right
as a member of ministry of environments
this is a reference book published by
this was written by you
witness please read
polyhexamethylene guanidine is not harmful to human body
thats right
back then the reference book
do not make statements you cant take back
do you understand
i object the defense is
that is all
prof chu sungmo
this is your labs inhalation toxicity report
after conducting a thorough toxicity test
is the cause of problems
the result of an animal testing confirms that phmg level
to pulmonary fibrosis
this is my labs conclusion
so spotless did not cause the lung illness
is it correct
yes thats correct
whats going on
plaintiff
yes
prof chu sungmo
for the past 3 years
yes thats right
objection
by stating a personal opinion
plaintiff be careful
we were concerned for that when we were contracted
that our test process and results are impartial
and fair
thats right
is that true
doctor doctor
whats going on
silence
could you please step forward
are you dr jung taehoon
thats right
ill ask once more
yes
its the truth
the process was fair
and the results are sound
spotless has nothing to do
with pulmonary fibrosis
dr jung what are you doing
how could you
dr jung
what the hell are you talking about
thats not true
tell me why
it cant be
how could this happen
youll receive a call from dr chu
do not waver at the result
and side with o2
thats
we have proven that a despicable group of people
on deaths of their family
by putting blame on an honorable corporation
twice you know
do it until the end
im sorry
they were adamant about keeping it a secret
its all in the past now
youve seen the tests
and you said its all true
yeah thats right
weve cleared our name
still believe spotless is to blame
it saddens me to no end
do you have any plans to sue them for damages
well
please sir
you cant take that
please
jiyoung
dont get sick
its great
congratulations sir
congratulations
this is all thanks to you
i have one more thing to announce

thank you for coming
say hello this is dr chu sungmo

my boy minwoo will receive a legal lung transplant
thank you
whats the bad news
this is indeed a terrible news

lets see
this is pretty simple
you knowingly sold a toxic product
then fabricated evidence when caught

what the hell are you doing
hes not going to die
o2 doesnt make products like that
am i right mr cho
that moron
have you been well
i miss you
more than ever today
mom
mom
mom
im hungry
since the humidifier disinfectant scandal
has been formed by the government
well now begin
and their families here at the congress
we will first watch a video of the victims testimonies
at first
the hospital said
they said my home shouldnt be dry
the tv said i should use it
im a murderer
and children
and the government that authorized it
why did my mom die
whose fault was it
technology and standards agency
what did you feel when watching that video
a lot more people have suffered
because of your certification
we technology and standards agency
youre not responsible
we certified it in accordance with the law and regulation
they got it certified as a detergent
how is that not a problem
we deal with products
as per toxic substance control law
 did i hear that right  how long have you served
and go for lunch okay
lets take a photo
you are all incredible
how are you all so high and almighty
you people allowed it to be sold
how could no one take responsibility for it
are you really civil servants
isnt it your job to protect the public
what are you doing
punish for murder
punish for murder
punish for murder
were here were the proof
according to a thesis
from korean society of environmental health

i obey
and you are not afraid sir stand under the cannonballs
everyone quickly take cover
chevalier dherblay royal musketeer
surely the famous aramis himself continue
a gentle breeze and smelling like matilda
she wrote to me
and
single one could either convince my mind or touch my soul
i have only one sister the captain

i thought you were already doing this
i wont marry your sister
im saving it for the battlefield
thats a thousand ecus

captain de treville

i thought i made myself clear
athos didnt give you my instructions
no no athos conveyed everything very clearly
they were forbidden to approach count chalet
captain but he is a traitor he tried
i know
what
with all his influence he would not attack the king alone
the comte de chalet will answer for his actions but before you dartagnan
warriors of france the british are already close
our ships from the nearest ports are ready to repel them
but we must prevent them from going ashore
i need two teams of volunteers
ready to go to almost certain death
very few will return
monsignor
one officer to whom experience had
desire to volunteer first when the moment came
comte de chalet sir
count you will lead the first detachment
take a step forward
it is an honor
who will lead the second
captain de treville
…well see

musketeers death is your calling
one for all…

gentlemen welcome
sir…
i have used your services many times in the past

you were a brave warrior
im proud to have fought alongside you
musketeer…

gaston will not keep his word
he will never give us independence
ill sail to london
what if he doesnt come
i will be very persuasive
 madam  sir
look whos arrived
gee
what does he want here
maybe the same as for us
im sure he loves being spanked
ill rest here until spring then tell me
only you can carry out this delicate task
have i not done enough for you
do you think its doable
i rely on your audacity and ingenuity
how are you athos
this time in london
im more worried about my fate
you will accomplish a feat in the name of france moreover for a considerable fee
dartagnan
dartagnan
your eminence dont you think
at our first meeting in prison you told me
what gift from france would meet your desires
a paper with your signature confirming that all my actions
dartagnan dartagnan hurry up quicker behind me
here is your indulgence
wait
your eminence you told me about your enemy
not a word more
musketeers are soldiers
who is there
your husband

i thought you love me as much as i love you
i loved you

dont come near me
will you forgive me
will you forgive me

aramis

dartagnan
it was the cardinal who kidnapped her i saved her life
i have an urgent message for the cardinal
where is she one more step  and a bullet to the head
my mind and your courage
where is constance bonacieux
why ask questions if you dont need answers
you kidnapped her i know
yes its true…
but thats not what you asked me
whats the rush it was very difficult to escape from the king
you do not love me…
but the reasons for your dislike are wrong
sometimes even from you
how dare you
i know who wanted to kill the king
and i know its not you
who
constance…
your majesty
no thats a lie
queen in luzon
six hours of travel for a fresh horse and a skilled rider
just ask her
if this is true then i
this is true
you will pay me for this
do not shoot
they tried to sail to england
and this was found on them
both  on crosses
quiet quiet dont worry
otherwise ill go crazy
stand up musketeer
you must decide that the war has taken away my mind
but the cardinal claims what did he give constance to you
yes its true
 is constance alive  yes
thank you
you are going to certain death
i hope you forgive me
get ready
constance in london necessary…

thank you
it bears richelieus signature
if you are compassionate take her the bible
excuse me
i arrived at the wrong time
you slept
so youre not offended
the duke has given me permission to bring you the bible
the lord loves martyrs so much which sometimes allows the innocent to be condemned
didnt you try to kill the duke
the war will also bring to france and england has only disasters
but im not trying to lure you away
i ask you for one favor
bring me a knife
murder
god will have all eternity to punish me
my fall happened a long time ago
i believed in freedom

come on pull pull more
almost there

captain de treville

i was never shown the order for my arrest
you are accused of stealing secret documents
you are accused of releasing spies
you are accused of treason
beyond your imagination
no monsignor
his eminence
musketeers
silence please
let me remind the court that a safe conduct has supreme power
written by your hand
in the highest circles
protestant camp to expose this conspiracy
to find a traitor you sometimes have
to be ready to pass for him yourself
of course it was risky
but you know
contains the key to the cipher
the state has its own mind inaccessible to me
im getting too old for this
captain you are smarter than our entire regiment
from now on you are the captain
i cant accept it
what with her
i found a father for her child
a nobleman
 yes  and the soldier
but gentle and beautiful
 beautiful  and we will get along with him
she seems to care about him

sarah we can still be together but not if shes the keeper
she was destined for a life in the anonymity of the masses
the plebs the common people
so she was a girl of low birth
but arent they willing to do anything
she was employed with mr dumousseaux
a merciful and kind man
out of affection he took the child under his care
he quenched her thirst for knowledge
intelligence
idea
mind
judgment
understanding
intelligence
acumen
jeanne went to the sainteaure monastery

jeanne grew up
monastic life became too oppressive for her

jean wants me to introduce you to the king

should a venereal disease appear  thanks but well leave it at that
i now have to teach you some customs
good
with that haughty attitude  this is versailles madame
i cant speak to the king like that
i dont think the king you want to hear speak
arms higher
perfect
but
you dont need a thousand tricks to excite his senses
but
should i say something special
your impetuousness will speak for you
the only thing you need to remember
do you need to do the following
is this a joke
absolutely not
except the dauphin
understood  yes
but
what if i dont take those steps
his majesty will find you clumsy
and  he is very sensitive to charm

champagne

he exudes malice
no idea
you know that
the dauphin
hes so handsome
and all those women there
the kings daughters adélaïde sophie victoire
i have rarely seen such ugly women
do we never see the queen
because she suffers from her husbands infidelity
like all queens of france
the king admires her discretion her humility her gentleness
he cheats on her in the palace and in the parcauxcerfs
she shouldnt have any luxury
or people who
your hood fast sit back
we can go better coachman

jeanne versailles explained her love for simplicity and the arts op
and that somewhere in austria
luckily for her jeanne was now first lady at court
but for how long
and dismiss jeanne at the slightest misstep
wonderful
what a divine mystery
is something wrong madame
only the stars interest you majesty
thats true
i love you madame
it turns you on that you dont know me  but i know you
she is dressed like a man
im not the queen  not yet
on her first official outing
jeanne appeared triumphantly arm in arm with the king
broke a woman with the habit of hoop skirt and powdered wigs
dont be so proud pride can destroy you
but jeanne the parcauxcerfs
i know hes not going there anymore
the pompadour had it built to satisfy his lusts
with you he doesnt need that anymore
precise not like some others
if you are so irresistible then why doesnt he marry you
then we must have our marriage annul
his greatgrandfather married his mistress
im most worried about zamor he only has me
you need a home and assets dont worry about that black one
thank you
louveciennes
jeanne finally had a place of her own
where she could retreat with her beloved king
and no one prescribed the law to her
you may enter
sit down
where did he come from
chandernagor in bengal
do blacks live there
this black one comes from africa but via india
i think he did several times sold
its striped
like a curtain
come now a page is white
a page is of nobility
although you should not be of nobility to stay at court
it is clear that nature gives them destined for slavery
in america this black would sugarcane harvesting
like all of gods creatures he is capable of salvation
and yours too and yours
and yours  totally agree
she agrees
a cookie  louise
here
like us he has a pink tongue

who was in his bed last night  madame de brèche
does the king have other mistresses
if i fall out of favor
warn me immediately then i leave
you must remain dignified and brave
and i am condemned to faithfulness
she was still his favourite
despite the derision about her striped dresses and mens clothing
the ladies of the court imitated her as eagerly as they blacked her out
behold that
jeanne had four happy years with the king
zamor grew up and thanks to jeanne a sensitive learned young man
but it was for adolphe now introduced to the court
enough adolphe stopper
better but
but another wedding took care of it for upheaval
the dauphin heir to the throne
finally got married the young marieantoinette of austria
jeannes position was in jeopardy
you need to see her skin  my god white as milk

victoire
she has her hair loose
terrible
how dare they
where that girl is
who is that beauty  thats a street girl
we have to get rid of that person
we are counting on you to disown her
i think im going off the table  behold
i cant see it
outrageous that the king wants that man proposals to the dauphine
that is unworthy of a christian king
obviously tonight were celebrating the end of that man
du barry cherishes for no one affection or hatred
with such a character one cannot rule  behold
this woman has something the pompadour missed
the thing between our legs dear lady
for that horrible woman to drive away from the court
the more you ignore that human the more the kingdom will love you
maybe hell listen to you
that person should not speak to you as long as you havent addressed her yet
you know that right
in that case
thank you
amen
adolphe is defeated in a duel
its serious a carriage is ready
jeanne came the death of adolphe not over

nine words from the beautiful mouth of a princess save jeanne from disgrace

i am committed to you
sin incarnate was
she was imprisoned in a monastery for a year louis xvi released her
the revolution was the end of privileges
and a rearrangement of the maps
the nobles stopped their vain quarrels and in the face of adversity
zamor sided with the republic and out of necessity or resentment
he betrayed his former mistress
that she was not of nobility didnt change that
in the eyes of the citizens jeanne had betrayed her origins long ago
marieantoinette on 16 october
and jeanne on december 8
her last words on the scaffold would have been
just a moment mr executioner
an8 i had this movie ever be able to make
an8without the light by my friend hervé temime

and afghan army incarceration facility number 32n°
at the iranafghan border
fayeri karimi of afghan border police will be part of this interrogation
and we shall be interrogating an alleged isis militant
so fatima
we were not expecting you alive
it is indeed a miracle that youre alive
thank our doctors
they really fought for your life
so
yes
i didnt think i would get out alive myself
thanks to all of you for saving my life
sir
sir please get my child back
the search is on
crying or getting emotional will not help you at all
it will only make things worse for you
we have every reason to believe that you are a dreaded terrorist fatima ba
so if you want to prove otherwise this is your chance
everyone here has the same teary stories
so take this conversation very seriously
and get to it straight
lets talk
yes sir
i am shalini unnikrishnan
i am from kerala india
and sir i was trapped
i was brainwashed sir
name
ishak fatima
the flight has landed
they are coming out goodbye
almost a year ago we left thiruvananthapuram
to serve khalifa
to fight the infidels
ishak was to become a mujahideen
she neither found the ground nor the sky
is enough to lead her astray
the vision is slowly getting blurry
nothing was spoken nothing was said
who leaves like this
she did not find the ground nor the sky
is enough to lead her astray
ishak
if they ask you anything
she mistook the prison for a flight
she left the branch of every tree
the memories of that greenery linger
the roads kept up the conversation
the crazy bird was imprisoned
she did not find the ground nor the sky
is enough to lead her astray
you yourself decided to go to syria
this is what is emerging
and for that you prepared for years
and against mankind
i
i did leave india of my own will
and yes i did a lot of preparation before leaving
it was all fed into my brain like programming
i had lost control over myself
i am not alone in this game
who have fled their homes only to be buried in this desert
fareed come on
allah wills it
welcome please enter
lets go
we have only one objective
which is
we love indian music
but i have stopped now
dont you consider things like music and song haram
we’re pashtuns  a tribe from the mountain
we are living here in the hindukush for thousands of years
even before islam
we never trusted pakistan anyway
we still dont
but what if the american army stops us at the border
talk to them in english only
give them the human rights spiel
they know that the talib people are savages
and one more thing
the americans arent the only obstacle
you need to be careful about the haqqani and talibani mujahideens
it is america that gave birth to these breeds
this is why isis
my kerala
heaven on earth
full moon night the love which came as a garland

ishak
unintelligible
dont i look like katrina kaif
dont i
in kasargod market beauty queen
thank you
piping hot
yeah
yes
rubbish anything she is telling
asifa
umm thanks
i dont use lipstick why
no makeup
my hijab suits me best
i love natural beauty
bollywoods first hijabi heroine
asifa ba
i think whether it is full makeup or a natural look
whatever you wear you should wear it with full confidence
were coming in five minutes
listen be nice and careful okay
hmm bye
okay so girls we are
going out for our first dinner together excited
yay
we can do a city trip and
hi im rameez
im doing my mbbs final year
hey come on rameez dont overdo it
were all comfortable dont worry
uh after mbbs umm
yeah im trying for ms
id like to try for the us or uk
why the us or uk
why not india
india
look
and for us muslims
punarjanam
in islam it is taught that however much you earn
you must donate a part of it to charity
and use it to help people
i will be able to help more people
plus i want to enjoy both life and the afterlife so
that is the plan
our treat
come on
love to but we have some urgent work
okay okay
all this looks so delicious doesnt it
yeah
cheese
unintelligible
sorry uh
you guys dont pray before eating food
i dont
should thank the god of food and farmers
my mother and grandmother chant some verses in sanskrit
but i dont know it specifically
now i just see yummy food and then i eat it so
hold on we do say thank you
we thank our mothers and the lady who cooks for us
but we say thank you after the meal
hey
hi sit
look theres dancing over there
lets go there yeah
unintelligible
without faltering or flinching or lowering their eyes
asifa yes
if you dont mind can i ask you something
sure go ahead
you were saying eating without prayer is a sin
why
and what were you praying anyway
i was thanking allah
i was saying
oh allah thank you so much for giving us this food and keeping us alive
your generosity knows no bounds
and this food we eat hmm
so if we dont thank allah
hellfire
what is hellfire
you dont know
you know
hellfire so
all the wrong deeds we do in this life
were punished for those after we die
and for all the good deeds we do
we get paradise as a reward
punishment even after death
my father is an atheist
god didnt make religion man did
so theres no need to be formal with god or fear him
leave it
asifa you were talking about hellfire
yes what is hellfire
so i was saying
that hellfire is seventy times hotter than fire on earth
oh dear
and in hell there is a dark well
where all the sinners are tied chained
hung upside down and burned
so whoever believes in allah
they get paradise in return
and those who do not believe in islam
this sounds so painful
i know
today i understand what go to hell actually means
isnt the relationship with god one of love
or should be
like the ones we have with our parents
god please dont be angry
but one minute anyway we are hindus
thats what why would your allah punish us hindus
unintelligible
only allah
and you are a nonbeliever
everybodys life has that one day of reckoning
and im sorry
you are a nonbeliever
youll surely go to hell
only allah can save you
no one else
whatever asifa used to say
they were quite scary
and i did not have answers to challenge those fears
nimah was from kottayam
so every weekend she would go home to visit
geetanjali used to like the hostel more than her home
since my home was far away i couldnt visit often
in malappuram
last eid all four of us friends celebrated together
asifas family was very nice
her mom made vegetarian food especially for me
that was around the time we started getting close to rameez abdul and mujeeb
and after training
and you a sunnat
hmm
women are not allowed to come here alone
dont shoot me
dont shoot me
dont shoot me
punishment is not a verdict
it is a lesson
a lesson
anyone who strays from this path
a lesson
and straying from this path
what this girl did
and her husband
ignored her wrongdoing
he is an even bigger criminal
and now this lesson
allah is great
my name is shazia
im your neighbour
im sorry
since everyones in a burqa
i didnt recognize you maybe
im fatima
fatima
ya allah
you dont know how dangerous that can be
and for women like us this is impossible
why did they cut that ladys hand off
because she was wearing lipstick
they cut her hand off just because she was wearing lipstick
good grace hey bhagwan
there is no bhagwan
there is only allah
im sorry
but youre telling me all this
you were alone in the market too
what if someone shot you
hes a khursani commander
they all take their orders from him
you walk carefully come
was getting shattered day by day
we all were trapped hopelessly in it
seeing them killing people brutally i
for many days i
and my fear was legitimate
because what is a crime and following punishment
was never taught to us in the hindu religion
i want to show you something very special
look at this video
this medicine
which in our language
is called chemical courage
is called captagon and amphetamine in pharma terms
is something that will keep your thirst for jihad alive
it will never let you stray from your one true objective
will help you go long periods without feeling hungry thirsty or sleepy
it will kill your coward selfinside you
and give birth to a mujahideen in you
who will hoist the flag of complete islamic domination
who will get the infidels to praise the one true allah
god is great
god is great
understood my jihadis…
this medicine
will make your work easier
get them closer to you
isolate them from their families
and as soon as possible hand them over for the next mission
what about that third girl
nimah
shes catholic sir
she wont be easily manipulated
mujeeb will have to do something special
great
so much time has passed
maulvi saheb
ohh shit nimah has messaged
bye asifa bye
they left
hmm
then i was telling her nima
hate you both
sorry sorry nima
it’s okay now
shit really
let’s see
hey
what how dare you do that
he hit her just now i saw
this is nonsense
youll forget all you have wished
one minute nimah
well go to the police
oi hey everyone come here
youll complain to the police
who are you threatening madam
nimah
nimah
who are you threatening
who are you threatening
no
help help
shalini
nimah
nimah
get up nimah
i am sorry guys but
be grateful allah saved you
are you justifying them
no
but think about it yourself
you were the only three not wearing a hijab right
im sorry but hes not like your gods
are you trying to say only allah protects
other gods dont protect exactly
because
your god is so helpless hes always asking for help from others
even your jesus nimah
see i understand what youre going through
but just think about it once
gods son
gods own son being hanged on a cross
alive
and god cant even save his own son how will he save you
enough
stop now
im sorry okay
but think about it
you overdid it
idiot hang up now ill talk to you later
show
even the thought of going out is scaring me
those dogs
getting scary dreams at night just cant sleep
if we were with you this wouldve never happened
now
these people make all muslims look bad
these bloody ba
sorry for my language
shalini
geetanjali
im sorry again
i promise this will never happen again
well teach them a lesson theyll remember all their lives
thats why i brought them here
do fix the rogues
its nothing just anxiety
dont overthink now
sure
actually
umm so listen
but if you need anything im just a call away okay
bye
take one pill each
whenever you feel anxiety just have this
water
thanks
it makes me feel very safe
right gitu yeah
and what if the mans gaze isnt threatening
then
i dont know
then
in an islamic marriage what does the qazi ask
everything is about accepting each other
if both are accepting then
how can love be a crime
but what about physical intimacy
i mean according to islam its considered illegitimate before the wedding right
it is not acceptable
in fact not just in islam
no religion condones premarital sex if it is a onenight stand
but if two people
decide to commit to a relationship for their whole lives
that’s where i spend all my nights and days
in school festivals were like holidays
so it was fun
now what its just about eating yummy food
here also we can eat
religious stuff i dont know much about
all these rituals customs
you dont want to celebrate it with your family
we can do all that in our old age
i dont think so
ive been praying since childhood
i agree with nimah
even i have been praying since childhood
allah listens
but you need to have faith
why not
just not in the way you hindus claim
here you go again
you will start again i have to go to the church and pray
happy diwali to you both bye
bye wait for some time
bye
bye
my mother sent this said forget your diet now
so
our religion has thousands of gods and goddesses
i think shiva is a big god
see im sorry but
youve heard that story about your big god right
the one in which he carries his dead wife on his shoulders
and roams around the country
how can he be a god
seriously
youre trying to say that the god shiva
yes
but in north india ram and krishna are the big gods
theyre known to be great
im sure you know the story of lord ram everyone knows it
that his wife was abducted by ravana
to save his wife
and you guys worship the monkeys too
im sorry
andone of your gods
fuck yeah this is so complicated and confusing
it is confusing because youre following the wrong path
its very beautiful and sacred
ill show you the right path
captagon amphetamines

come on
may allah always protect you
come on not through this gate take the back gate
its not my phone
you guys are going home
but will you be able to tell your families about abdul and rameez
it will create unnecessary complications
and anyway
you will see how you will be illtreated
i doubt youll be able to fight back such behaviour
ajit
child
what is this
will you stop believing in god tomorrow
child
all this worshiping of stones
is not going to help you
how could he
a god who is so helpless could never save the lives of others
after realizing all this
hey
come please come
got yourself a coconut i see
you didnt even call me
i was too stressed
same bro
my communist father
and his socalled wife my mother
shalu im telling you
communists are the biggest hypocrites
hmm livein relationship
our bodies have accepted each other
hmm good
oh youre overacting as if i dont whats been going on between abdul and you
before rameez and i said i accept to each other you both did the same
along with romance you are spying on us too
silly girl
but truthfully gitu
im experiencing all of this for the first time in my life
when he looks at me only i feel okay okay okay
too much excitement but there is a small problem
hey see what shes telling
see what gitu is telling abdul
islam isnt a complex religion like others
it is simple and straightforward
and the one who runs it is the same
close both your eyes and feel the presence of allah
for this you do not need to visit any church or temple
you dont need to offer flowers oils and leaves
if you need money go to this temple
if you want knowledge go to that temple
if its strength you want go to that temple
you dont need to go from one place to the other
simply ask allah for his blessing
he will grant you every wish
this peaceful religion
come and change your life
nice lecture right hmm
thank you gitu
im shalini
we live right here in the centre dormitory
are you hindu too
im bhagyalakshmi
out of us 48 girls
there are seven christians
the rest are hindus
we all left our houses and came here
what happened to you
we all 48 girls have the same story
they get us married off to random men
before falling in love with them
so
what will you do now
our love is true
you would cross all limits right
oh dear shalini
one minute dont worry
geetu i’m not feeling well
no way i dont believe it okay i am not that irresponsible
get a dna test done youll get your confirmation
okay look
im sorry for behaving rudely okay just sit
in some time everyone in the hostel will know
it will reach my family
youre not understanding enough listen to me
listen to me
the problem you are mentioning has a solution
just marry rameez
but how shes a hindu girl
so so
what yes
after the wedding this child be your legitimate child
then is there any problem
my family has no problems if i marry a muslim girl
that doesnt make any sense
suddenly converting to a muslim how… why
for us for our child for our marriage cant you do this
see gitu asifa
please understand what shes going through
she will only do what is right for you the child and herself
yes
rameez
everything will be okay
shalini
please have faith in me
hmm
okay then
ill talk to the seniors about your wedding
but before that ill have to talk about the conversion so
you accept right
you accept right
who poured poison into the virgin minds
which destroyed the very soul
showing the wrong image of the religion
the hooligans changed the existence of humans
flows a beautiful river
behind that lies a house
on the rooftop you and i
dear allah will give it to us
will be our paradise
as she opened her eyes she could see all
we suffered heavy losses during the us drone strike last night
ishak was martyred
come in
shazia ishak is dead
what
coming here was a huge mistake
fatima calm down
let me do something
but look
don’t try to run away again
if you try to run
okay
he suffered a cardiac arrest
mother called
so go and meet them
my parents make no difference to me
they dont believe in allah
whoever doesnt believe in allah is an infidel
may allah reward you for your good deed
look youre absolutely in the right anisha
but till you dont deal with your past life
look
she did not get the ground nor the sky
is enough to lead her astray
that you converted to islam
he could not bear the shock
this heart attack is allahs wrath
its a lesson
…for any person who doesnt believe in him
if you care for your wellbeing
then convert to islam
she did not get the ground nor the sky
rameez has completed his job
give me a couple of days sir it will be done
isis has given us the opportunity to finish what alamgir aurangzeb
of course i do abdul
why are you going on and on about syria
there is nothing bigger than serving god
and you dont want
we can help hoist the flag by staying here too
like asifa does
thats what she does isnt it
are you going to marry me or not
if you force me to
i wont
why would i listen to you
look
i will destroy you
when all these things were happening with shalini
first you preached good things about islam
then you pretended to fall in love with us
so that you could have sex with us
you wanted to get me pregnant right
you dared to question my manhood you mother
you called me impotent
check this
this
when
when did you take this picture
you only sent these nudes to me while drunk
impotent
now you listen
you will marry me and come to syria
and if you say no
i will make your video go viral on social media
he would turn out to be such a selfish coward
hes an infidel
but now what will happen to me
and what about this child im pregnant now
have faith in allah child
he will make everything all right
if a kind man blessed by allah
is willing to marry you
it cannot happen
try to understand your situation child
some decisions must be taken by the brain not by heart
you cannot go back to your home
they wouldnt even accept you
and
you cant get rid of this baby either
and you still haven’t finished your nursing degree
id rather die by killing myself
youre actually thinking of suicide after converting to islam
your first crime
second crime
third crime
your parents are infidels
how many crimes will allah punish you for
so would marrying someone else mean my sins are forgiven
not by continuing living in this country
but yes
if you get married
then allah would forgive not one
but a thousand sins
sorry dad
i’m a bad girl
but it isnt my fault alone
its yours too
you keep teaching me foreign ideology like communism but
…you never told me about our religion… our traditions
i wont go back dad i wont
you were right
so were mother and nimah
big mistake
big mistake
do you accept ishak as your legal husband in exchange
do you accept
i do
fast please fast
do you accept
i accept
congratulations congratulations
get aside you cant go in
shalini
shalini

mr maulvi

mr maulvi fatima

shes my daughter
youre the one who isnt getting it aunty
were here with her you can leave
please leave aunty
hello
child
they didnt let shalini come with me
and shalini didnt insist on coming either
why
aunty because
shalini is pregnant
and even on official twitter handle
it has been uploaded on various platforms in over a hundred groups causing a stir
according to sources these were uploaded from pakistan afghanistan and malaysia
whoever refuses to go to syria
they wanted us to leave india anyhow thats it
then i happily started preparing to go to syria
you dont know how dangerous that medicine is
youve seen those videos right
where they easily slit the throats of infidels
sir these medicines make any person
without any fear
so
becoming a killing machine
it was all done easily
because salafi centre the travel agencies and the embassy were all colluding
and asifa took me for some lavish shopping
in several cases of sedition and national security
even maps
like toposheets solar compass and different survival apparatus
before we left for colombo
i was allowed to meet my amma
my child but my mother was only told that
we were going to colombo for our honeymoon
after i come back from colombo ill come home
dont stress
keep it
call me child
hurry up
hello
nimah hello
im in colombo for our honeymoon
did you marry rameez
nimah im pregnant
rameez deceived me and left
he left india
asifa is behind all this
you told me to meet mujeeb right
so he
everyday
18 to 20 people would come
and then i used to lose count
everything would turn blurry
i couldn’t even file an fir
you dont know
geetanjali committed suicide
what gitu
when why you didnt call me
shalini fuck the honeymoon
just come back youre not safe shalini please come back
okay i
ill talk to you ill call you ill call you in some time
ill talk to you later ill call you back
my friend nimah called
nimah was raped
and geetanjali committed suicide
and geetanjali left islam to become a hindu again
maybe they both paid for their sins
when we were leaving colombo
it did occur to me once
why would allah be so cruel
geetanjali and nimah were believers
then why would such bad things happen to them
that i bought it
sir this is a global agenda
sir these machineries are isolated in europe and america
our exchief minister has said
that in the next twenty years kerala will become an islamic state
on an average of 2800 to 3200 conversions
are happening
more than 30000 girls are missing sir
the unofficial number is 50000
we all believe that sir
703
261
you cant do this
hey move
sazia listen to me hey
sazia help me
wait let go of me
its a big nexus between a local organisation of kerala and isis
theyre raising a ruthless ruthless army of suicide bombers
is this harmless
i respect them too
we will start investigating your complaint from today itself
but for everything you are telling me
youre giving us news and numbers
not evidence the credible evidence
how can we interfere with the life decisions of two adults
come on
give this baby to me
she is too young
wait
wait shes too young she wont survive please
ishak
just to take my fir down
it took this long
how long will justice take
when
will you ask for evidence then too
you know about attikad in kasargod right
you still want evidence
sri lanka singapore afghanistan
and you still want evidence
okay fine sir
okay fine
you wait sir i will get it
came here for love
turned me into a slave
sex slave
youre new here
slowly youll understand
these people dont kill us
but they kill our souls every day
were their slaves
here if husbands die in battle
their wives either have to become fulltime sex slaves
other than that a woman here has no third choice
bhagyalakshmi
im shalini

it seemed to me that we were crossing the iranian desert
and going towards irbil
which is close to the syriaturkey border
and i knew that the syria iran and turkey border
so i knew
that this was my last chance to escape from there
delta to base
on journey right now and
we seem to have located the target

we dont slit tongues

basavaraja
kariya come here

the government is providing free fertilizer
not just here it is happening every where
devaraya from bheemanahalli
he is boasting off like a philanthropist
the government has realised this
that is why
to provide food to the poor
but you are snatching their food
it will not work for long father
one fine day they will revolt
wait and see
they will remain slaves and us landlords
they are just slippers with souls

brotherinlaw
is it true that landlord is distributing fertilizer

i agree she is a little mischievous
but she doesnt lie in these matters
she is highly educated
she cares about our people
indeed
her face
her bosom
her waist
if i were in kateras place
instead of forging the iron
i would have forged her
inanimate bottle makes noise when chocked
otherwise
true man should work hard

sir
if there is any
you may not trust us
but i am an honest man
mahadevi bring buttermilk
take it
when you voluntarily make a marriage proposal
the groom becomes arrogant
just take it
mahadevi
we are not superiors just because we are born in this family
clothes we wear
food we consume
culture and traditions have made us superiors
and provide sacred offerings
tell your daughter that we have huge differences
my lord
unknowingly
ill educate him
we must strike while the iron is hot
basava
yes my lord

i didnt see caste or wealth in love

i would only marry you
prabha
our life is in this furnace
beyond this lies
your comfortable life
between you and i
if i try to cross it
people who lit camphors
cannot comprehend the heat of the furnace
get going
brother prabha

you are my companion of many births
my heart is filled with joy
i am hearing wedding music

as per my experience
i am asking you to report it as natural death
you continue with your studies for your satisfaction
but the result will be the same
ie natural death
okay
give me time till evening
sir
sir
is it possible to find out the cause of death by studying bones
yes it is possible
that is their expertise
i hope there are no holes in it
you walked three hours straight in this rough terrain yet you dont look tired
imagine how you were in your younger days
you had strength workmanship a loving town
even after all this
how did you go behind bars

one should face the war
just strength is not enough
hey rudra
women from our agrahara
katera
soil became fertile due to rain
but
a volcano of anger erupted
but here
but now
sir

serfdom
feudalism
untouchability and etc are the evil practices of the society
in order to eradicate them
land reforms act has been passed

ive hiranya kashyap in my body and soul
ill perform in such away that people should remember me by bhakta prahlad play
changla changla
in a couple of minutes
bhakta prahlada drama shall begin
i request everyone to be seated
hey this is changlu
he cannot even speak why is he on the stage
who am i
son of kashyapa brahma
born from the womb of diti
i am a conquistador who conquered death
i vanquished the swank of the children of aditi
earth quakes when i step forward
the sky trembles when i raise my head
when i raise my hand the whole creation shivers
when the creation of fourheaded brahma is following my orders
after all my son
the son whom i fathered
my son who is entitled to continue our clan
shame
what a shame
you call this a life
what an ill struck fate
what an ill struck fate
i thought i am the mighty
what superpower is haunting me
what superpower has made my son my foe
what a surprise
what superpower has stopped him from embracing death
what superpower has made me hang my head in shame
yes its him
that evil
hey hari
wicked man
traitor
you entered my sons mind
you messed with his mind
if you are really the perfect supreme being
show yourself
show yourself to me
i am not hiranya kashyapa
i am not hiranya kashyapa
hail changlu
please forgive us that is
i am not upset that i lost my role
seeing your performance
i couldnt clap my hands
this made me upset
brotherinlaw
brotherinlaw
you held your fathers reputation high
yes you did
yes
sir
we have been supporting you from the beginning
we provided you man power
is this fair
from the beginning
we have protected
your throne
what else can i do to help as a legislator
madam indira has passed this act
it is mr urs who is executing it
sir
ask them how much money they want to stop this act getting executed
he is very kind towards the poor
if this act is executed
millions of families will have a stable future
to safeguard your power
snatching our power is not fair
mr krishna
tell them that power is not permanent
persistence is of no use
come what may they are not going to revert the decision
the wrong way
the government will send a survey team
make your sure
lessees should not come near your fields
if lessees dont show up
that land will remain with you
this assurance is more than enough
you just be like a cool breeze
we are ready to flame up like fire
those farmers
my lord
in other villages
but
indeed
blushing huh
begin the search  yes sir
rachappa go search over there
yes sir
officer
ill explain
search every nook and corner
check there  yes sir
what about here
search every nook and corner
hey stop
search every nook and corner
this is our goddess i beg you
what is this
arrest him
someone has done it intentionally
stop where are you going
we want to see our brother
under the iron hammering sound
officer
instead of questioning me why i chopped it
ask me why i stand for farmers
i can answer
you cannot make me spill the beans
how dare you
you bloody
come
kati
oh my god
what is this kati
have they gone insane
sister
in big shots game
we are just pawns
prabha
farmers should not stop working in their fields
let any supremo come
you should make sure
goddess kateravva will show us a way
you have to pay as much as we have said
this is a sandalwood case
it is a false allegation sir
i dont want to handle this case
it is a false allegation sir
the court demands evidence not truth
he has only one option left
ask him to confess his crime
i can request the judge to reduce the punishment
how are you father
forget about me
what brings you here
ill go bring it
katera is facing punishment without committing any crime
someone has framed him purposefully
from to weeks
kindly
i beg you father
get him released
stop right there
are you not aware of which caste should be served in which glass
when the god of who gets worshipped
becomes a stepping stone
you shunned us away
you were dead to me the day you shunned us away
greetings sir  hello
since he got caught with the goods
it has a strong evidence
now you have only option
we were depending on katera
but he got imprisoned without committing any crime
now prabha is visiting the court
we must take a concrete decision
let us pay as much he asks and work on our fields
look at the old man
hey old man
are you coming here to take your life
dont be so stupid
get lost
so much courage
how did they muster it
retreat run
you are getting released
and surrendered himself
who is that officer
they used to exploit us now they are threatening us
it is because we gave lenience to them
growth of a nation depends on its farmers
devotees eat the same food
soldiers eat the same food
labour class eat the same food
and that food is provided by farmers
food is seen as god
the one who creates that god is farmer
when united
let us be united hereafter
we have no king to rule us
what we have is
this lush green
mother earth
we are her soldiers
green is our breath
green is our robe
green is our
flag
he is as strong as a boulder
dont dare to face him
he has a troop to back him up
he coined green is our breath
o son of soil listen
you are our proud flag
this rebellious spirit is building the nation
the whole town
has united as one
they are marching forward
they think zamindar system is their right
out of fear of losing their right
they have taken these steps
on top it
officers who were meant to support us
with no other option left
we have approached you
miss look
this is not a recent order
this act
from tomorrow you need not visit taluk office
you show your tenancy papers to them
they will examine them
you need not worry at all
i
she spoke confidently in front of the district collector
she mentioned all the law points
she made the dc dumbstruck
she has mustered too much courage
greetings my lord
we have disputes between us
not respect
you are our lord forever
respect towards you will never decrease
your presence is a must for every fair festival and occasions
we are getting married next week
on the same day government officials are giving us land documents
villagers will be happy if you hand over papers to them
few people addressed her madam
now she has started behaving like madam indra
i am really shocked to see her headweigh
once a slave
if dont answer them
they will keep questioning us my lord
boss
we have a job
hey kati
ill be back in a minute
simply stay put
get inside right now
hey kati
hey katera
my fate
speak of the devil
you are the fourth generation
what you mean by generations
forget it
then there will be bombarding of pecks
today is our last day as lovers
from tomorrow we are husband and wife
todays peck is love
tomorrows peck is a duty
i want it today
for that you should say serve meal
hey rangappa
nothing like that katera
you were busy in wedding arrangements
hey brotherinlaw
come inside
how can it be
lets go
spill the beans
they are northies
they are well diggers
they are called laal khooni danav
it means bloodthirsty monsters
whats their business here
to execute the people who have tenancy papers
that devaraya has hired them
tonight
this landlord has gone insane
we have worked in his fields for years
now he wants to kill us
lets go lets alert the town
what
that means they came here many days ago
now they know all the entry points of our village
they are not in finger counting numbers
they are a huge battalion
brotherinlaw
i dont know
turn around
take off your mask
remove the mask i say
you
yes i will
i will
we are ready
let there be elders women children
our swords shall taste their blood
grant us your permission
hail bhavani
hail bhavani
katera
boss has ordered us
but one particular head should be presented at his feet
that head
is it yours
by the time i reach you you will know
whether it is me or not
i am hundreds steps away from you
here we have one person for every step
you are seeing only me
but from my view point
you all are caught in my hands
we are 108 men in total
hundred doesnt matter to me
because
you will cease to exist
that offering remained unfulfilled
today i am going to make that offer
go chop his head off
lets do it
chop him off to pieces
attack
o goddess
killing men
is a sin
but
kindly forgive me
kindly
what is this
everyone is here to attend the wedding
how to get in without getting noticed
you are right
cover your face
katera
kati kati kati
look at her
someone stabbed this goddess to death in the dark
how could you leave me like this
did you seek my consent before leaving me
what to do when the light is gone
my soul longs for its soul mate
untimely death has taken away my beloved
how could you leave me like this
take what you want sister
kati
may you be blessed by goddess ganga and yamuna
so many unspoken words are still whispering in my heart
i am now an ocean without waves and a body without breath
grant me permission i seek forgiveness
how could you leave me like this
did you seek my consent before leaving me
what to do when the light is gone
my soul longs for its soul mate
untimely death has taken away my beloved
for innocent souls
is there no value
a life that does not value other lives
should not be alive
or should i feel sorry for prabha
people flee away in rough times
but you fought for your village
greeting you is not enough
you should be worshipped
you are the god katerappa
till now i worked for salary
after seeing you i want to work for the society
lets go
lets go
how do you know all this
you found 107 skeletons
but the band which came from the north
you are still young
you should live long
there was love which can transform a beast like me
i saw the future of my villagers
i was supposed to end up behind bars for committing murders
but he showed me the path to education
i was supposed to become a killing machine
madam
if you report this
a natural death
my god who is behind bars
will get released one fine day
otherwise
i beg you madam
in your hands
you asked for some details
pertaining to an old incident occurred in bheemanahalli
its okay
brotherinlaw
devaraya is no more
kalegowda made our village a living hell
yes katera
our land has become barren
ponds and lakes are dead dry
entire village is now a zombie land
and lord vishnu has chakra
ole mari should be applied
ole mari has its own weightage
and you have your own katera
but it came out
i built a wall to prevent it from entering our farmland
it smashed the wall
he cannot even touch it
he should touch it
yes indeed
bring the sacrificial buffalo
katera
look at you now
how was the prison life
i pity you
after we have our food
have a gluten free meal
and get lost from here
not for the spirit
this undying spirit
if i choke while eating
or you get caught in my hand
i drink only blood
change is inevitable
yes indeed
but
not this much
paddu
mom
mom
where is mom paddu
paddu
are you hurt
are you feeling the pain sister
the pain which you caused by stabbing us
is more agonising than this sister
by shunning us away
you humiliated us for life
i am getting married tomorrow
ive not committed any mistake paddu
but the reputation of the family which nurtured you with love and care
kindly let me live
i beg you
i want to live with him
if you wanted to have fun
i would have hooked you up with someone from our own caste
but
you had lust towards that dog
reputation of our parents
is not just spoiled
you ruined it
paddu paddu
dont abandon me
i am getting married tomorrow
i want to live
kati
kati
yes
i killed prabha
more than love
our caste is important to us
we can console ourselves if our daughter dies
but we cannot accept when she elopes with someone like you
she was my sister
i would have forgiven her if she had lost her chastity within our community
but she spoiled the sanctity of our caste by marrying you
even if i had ten sisters
and if all had committed such a filthy sin
just like i killed her
by gaining knowledge
became a brahmin
the light which was lit to identify professions
but
used that fire to burn down the humanity
the greatest clan of all is
the human race
the greatest respect of all is
the selfrespect
but prabha
she had equality
she had literacy
she had ambitions
instead of worshipping that goddess
you killed her
no one requests god
to make them born in a particular caste
every child is equal to god
label it with humanity
label it with love equality and compassion
and the village will prosper
the hatred and fury created by this ole mari
the darkness calls to you
give me a helper
oh
gotcha
e pinocchio well do not peep
so donut where are the wedding doves
what doves

if you call names ill pour this potion on you

twenty years ago
there was an invincible swordsman
he challenged the best of all sects
without a single defeat
in just a few years
he became wellknown
and had more enemies
in the end he fought against all masters at broken soul cliff
that day
wolong was the only one
but after the battle
no one knew the reason
many years later
the rakshasa sect from western regions entered central mainland
they searched high and low to hunt wolong down and kill him
our qingcheng sect has never interfered in others affairs
just because it was said that sword immortal wolong
had met our master once before going to live in seclusion
our whole sect was slaughtered
fellow brother tian
be patient
sixth fellow brother
dont do it
there is no turning back after practicing this bloodreversing manual
we can go to longmen town
if your gods and buddhas are real
they should cast those rakshasa beasts to hell
where is longmen town
theyre
just a bunch of stray dogs in hiding
hold your breath
its no good sixth fellow brother
look out
before that old man died
shes luo xiaoman daughter of luo yueniang
the manager of longmen town inn

coming all the way here
a normal person would have been thirsty
you have chapped lips
but you didnt drink the tea handed by cripple
you must be on your guard
its the first time im here
i have no choice but to beware

its about the secret and safety of longmen town
i dont care
how on earth could i leave
i have to think of something
these are rations and travel expenses
were even from now on
hey
can i stay
can i
neither go nor die
no
no room for discussion
yueniang cant show up
we will make our moves
longmen town
doesnt allow outsiders to come in
and get out alive
get on

then i will die
theres something more important in longmen town than my life
i cant go
you are
babbling insanely
or else
i wont care whether you are dead or alive
that day when we were underwater
although
it was
luo xiaoman i

that damn man
he dares to chase the same girl as i do
duo

its your blessing
to die in my hands
remember my name

swordsman duoqing
old man
old man
old man
old man
my stuff
once your potential is pushed
your internal force will reduce
its not worth it
young master
we can let him fight wolong to death
check whats on there
you have no right
to interfere with what i do
give it to me
in sangcheng
in fact
and lead the way to outsiders to go there
spread the news
that the rakshasa is coming
i can do
xue
kiddo
the rest
is on this map
this old man
has nothing left to teach you
old man
old man
old man
after waiting for so long i finally got you
are you
talking to me
when i knew what xiaoman had suffered
i was heartwretched
to save you
with a hemp rope
a wooden plank
and saved you
every time i think about it
my heart aches so much that i cant breathe
today
with your blood
thanks
you saved me i saved you
thats all
the stars overhead
as long as its not money
stars
ill give them to you
are you sure those are wolongs sword skills

or else i duoqing
a few days ago that boy didnt know material arts
after one night
he made a thoroughgoing change
if thats the case
this boy is much appreciated by him
so what we can
judging from what we saw the other day
he didnt know material arts
xiaoman
can i come in
no
tell me
i told you before
just so you know
ive decided to accept him
but
there were intimate relations between you two
if you like him
i will let him marry you all right
i dont like him
im going to bed
its all my fault
i left
dont
ive been busy all night
lets go
where are the stars
close your eyes
hurry and close your eyes
open your eyes
in all the years ive been here
ive never had such good food

 come on come on  i think its good
right
my god its not sweet enough
this is flour
put it down
why are you petty again
pingan
come
sit here
sit down
me
yeah
ruling out the possibility that youre a member of the rakshasa sect
once youre with us
we will live and die together
so we all think of each other
everyone will treat you like a nephew of theirs
why dont you wear
the clothes i gave you
its not fit
it fits
i havent worn any new clothes
wearing these clothes
arent clothes
were your clothes
old since the beginning
the clothes shengnan gave you
were actually made for her brother
shengru
the descendant of judge wu in guanxi
had wounded a few members of the rakshasa sect because he couldnt stand the sight of injustice
that rakshasa sect took revenge on him
shengru was the only one who escaped from the wu family
shengnan watched her brother die tragically
here
for our longmen town
having more strength to fight against rakshasa
bottoms up
come on bottoms up
its too late
after all this time
i finally found someone like you
after a while
i thought she was you
i know
its just a new guy coming in
show yourself
pretty girl
your outfit
and weapon
if im not mistaken
youre that crazy woman
mo luo
its crazy dog mo luo
i am duoqing
i
have no interest in knowing a dead mans name
ill get someone else to drink with me
will you
finding someone else to drink with
cheers
we could often
hear her sobbing in her room in the town
for her brother
come on brother
sister
swordsman duoqing
with a heartless sword
seven days
we were late
this is zhaos niece
she survived by hiding
in the haystack of the stable
its only seven days
its not like we are close to each other already
a piece of clothing and a meal
why should i care about their lives
their lives are more important obviously
quit waiting
your husband sold you out
for a chance to live
xiaoman
luo xiaoman
go with me hurry up
its so far
were running out of longmen town
where are going
in brief
when you fainted the other day
do you really like me
wei pingan
this is probably
the only chance in my life to trust a man
the dog is coming
ive had enough of hiding
for years
we meet again after all
ive waited
a long time for this day
i must protect them
let them go
and you can
take my life
you dont have bargaining counters to talk to me
you
haotian
it was an accident
she would rush in
and was trying to talk you out of the final battle
but you
were out of your mind because of killing
you sent my son
back to me with false pretenses
reasons
because xue gave birth to yanzhi
to torture me
when i was off my guard
you stole my son
have you ever told wuji
about my appearance
at the last moment to save your life
you even try to pass the buck to a kid
today
you will
pay your life for xue
as for yanzhi
were actually made for her brother
run
take xiaoman with you
hurry
hurry and run
never ever coming back
run
have you found yanzhi
their bodies are also checked
no snowflake birthmark on the left shoulder was found
brat
youre digging your own grave
so that you could kill him yourself
but this sword
why cant you
i said
to get involved with my business
get lost
dont
once your potential is pushed
your internal force will reduce
its not worth it
brother
looking at how painful you are
do you know how ive felt all these years
no
our father has two sons
your mother died
and he missed her all his life
to seek your mothers revenge
when my mother passed away
he didnt even shed a tear
i have pushed you off the cliff
why
when youre gone
if i cant change anything
then i dont need to do so
i need nothing now
what does let go mean
i cant teach you the last move
now
arent you tired little brother
none of your business
arent you tired of
living like this
although i cant kill you
a generation of gratitude or resentment ended
the living
may suffer more
there are only loneliness and redemption
this is karma

the red dragon clan was defeated and retreated
at this point
we must use the map to guide the way
its been nearly a hundred years since i took over the guardian map of peach blossom spring saint girl
now that the time is coming
the peach tree god predicts that the next saint girl
only the heart is like a mirror
for the human world anymore
youve decided to say goodbye to the past
to
the door is always closed
thats why im going home
please follow the orders of the guardian
peace for generations
bad news
bad news

ive broken my seal
be sure to guard it well
photo
the day when you taught zhong jiemei and me magic and martial arts
have left me
now that im alone
im afraid ive failed your trust
isnt your goal just to get this painting
i wanted to break the earth
but now i want to protect you more
of the red dragon clan
we killed most of the heavenly maid and saint aunt yiqing died
is the one who saved worryfree
he ruined our disciples plan
what on earth happened
brother fan
dont go father

for me too
brother fan
seeing that youre okay
lord
i have another reason for what happened that day
brother fan
okay qi your majesty
who saved you from the brink of death
to teach you magic power
i acted without telling the truth
the heaven and man tribe seems weak
everything is under control now
your majesty
i wont let you go
all he cares about is his wife in the mortal world
wake up
dont always be a princess
but i dont want you to succeed
you two to capture heavenly maid wuyou capture drawing immediately
but if brother fan stops him
everyone go that way
over there
let me help you
thank you
thank you
be careful later
come here
saintess
fortunately no one was hurt
weve almost settled the people here
if the peach forest is destroyed by the demon lord
the demons can easily occupy peach blossom spring
no matter what the purpose is
even if i hurt myself i wont hurt you
why does my heart hurt
besides you saved me once
it makes people forget all their troubles
but you inserted yao
once the demons break in
this is also the reason why demon realm bewitched you humans to snatch it
but the lord of demon realm saved our lives
our yao jun intended to strengthen the city
dont you think its suspicious
brother fu
theyve found this place
we all miss you
brother fu
liao peng
he just wants to use us to get into peach blossom spring
ive found my wife and im worryfree
two brothers
sima yi
now you still want to
kill this witch first
brother
weve been being used
brother
also known as binhai
theyre back
theyre back
youre back
the picture is gone
the picture is gone
guardian jin
fan yihang
this traitor ruined my great cause
i have long suspected that fan yihang has evil intentions
now the soil is missing
okay
fan yihang
red dragon clan
even if you drain the sea water
you bastard dream
you dont want me anymore
ill take you back to demon realm
release
qiaoyi
so they rebelled together
but they were buried
but when he was in this land
he met his wife
but i didnt find my husband
he was heartbroken
are you crying
all the time
to bury all officials in mourning
now i allow you to come to the seaside to offer sacrifices
see you in the afterlife
they met again
let them meet again
no matter what happens
they cant be separated again
and the beautiful scenery of taoyuan is what i want
fields
your eyes will be golden
in the mortal world
where they grow in winter
it has strong vitality
what happened to the people
and ill spare your life
kill the witch and hand over the map
kill the witch and hand over the intention
why dont you believe me
and you
everyone
the red dragon is tyrannical
its to overthrow tyranny
his majesty
without him
we would have died in the north
you used the spiritual power of peach trees to dispel the evil poison for me
is it red
yes it cant
one of our suspects has been drugged
how could this happen
are we really poisoned
brother fan
you know how to use it
photo
these must be a coverup
brothers
he came back to demon realm after telling me about this
sima yan
the red dragon clan is brutal
if they get the painting
even the mortal realm will suffer
to a safe place
saint girl of yihang
its not easy for you to escape from the coastal forbidden area
lets see what i can do to help
thats great
but what worries me the most now
thank you for protecting them for me
ive found my mortal wife
i cherish your affection for me
dont tell me that
well
well
we can attack at any time
go to seize the map immediately
so you didnt want to help them at all
right
is a hundred miles away
no flowers no leaves
its time to change
assist me to seize disciples
then ill cast spells to guide the way
guys go first
his majesty saved my life
but yihang cant watch the demons go to hell
if saint girl lets us cross this bridge
our debt will be written off
give you endless wealth and prosperity
youre just dreaming
you killed shengguo
today i want you
to pay with your blood
dont leave any of them
princess
princess father

its like a dream
whats going on
liao peng
in my lifetime
i will never let demons get involved in any place
800 miles of peach trees
are burning with fragrance
a happy and worryfree life
i believe there will be more peach blossoms in the future

look deer tracks
wounded by a bullet
its their watering hole
its in two days so soon
they want a small audience
how were they
the lady who came to me seemed nice
the companys actually a talent agency

 ill try it soon  please do
 mr suruga  yeah
quills are used for instruments
what kind of instrument is that

thanks for this takumi
my son will love this
 see you  good night
thank you for joining us on such short notice
we plan to operate a glamping site here its set to begin construction in may
thank you for coming
thanks for your cooperation
glamping in harasawa
some of you may be unfamiliar with the word glamping
thats all from us
now for your questions and opinions
please pass this on
the site can handle up to 64 people whys the septic tank capacity for 50
we think its adequate
but numbers will vary by season
then that should be the benchmark
optimize thats just for your own benefit
yes please go ahead
can you show us the septic tank blueprint again
if you drain from that spot
you cant put the tank there
we spoke to authorities
we were given some limitations on drainage locations
wells connect to groundwater
its the water supply for us and communities downstream
or build a reservoir onsite
one moment
thats not for you to decide
go ahead
it will rob me of my purpose for being here
but im not here to talk about myself
they look so proud and happy
your valuable input will be considered
our company president he has the last word
but youre a talent agency
so what do you know
why isnt your consultant here then
our schedules didnt match up
its like talking to a wall
it will become a new tourist hotspot
maybe the visitors will stop by your udon restaurant
more people means better business
itll invigorate this region
lets think about that
your glamping site is basically a campingthemed hotel right
well we cant keep track of each guests actions
you just said you cant keep track of each guest
there wont be a caretaker on site from 11 pm to 6 am you said
 i dont know about that  i do
i was a caretaker myself so i know how these things work
but someone needs to be there around the clock
they could become more frequent once your glamping site arrives
well oppose the plans
when does construction start
its scheduled for may but could be delayed a month
thats why youre rushing
this briefing is just to make you look good on paper
youre throwing us under the bus just to make a quick buck
now you know the problems
and we know that its no use talking to you
bring your boss and the consultant next time
well help if the plan is good
my grandparents were settlers
it doesnt have a long history
in a way all of us here are outsiders
balance is key
if you go overboard you upset the balance
we hope to arrange another briefing session
we now realize how ignorant we were
we would like to learn more if you have time
it all boils down to what takumi said earlier
im not even talking about conservation
thats our duty
we need you to understand that
then we can talk again
go tell your boss
yes you have a question
yeah you like it
i do indeed
 in the field  i see
you should get takumis number
he can help out if you ask him properly
do ask properly though
until next time
call me if you need anything
thank you for your time today
want some more
its yummy
have a bite
this project is full of holes
of course its not perfect
well make changes as we proceed
well i dont think that will change their minds
how can you say that
one is to show authorities that you are communicating with the locals
the other is giving locals a chance to let out steam
they were steamrolling us
one demand you can meet is 24hour supervision
a little pollution wont affect the water
the locals are not as stupid as you think mr horiguchi
i never called them stupid
we need to rethink this plan from scratch
what do you think mr hasegawa
it amounts to two months sales
it goes into your paychecks too
yes exactly
we just bought the land
theres no turning back
mr horiguchi
 i have an idea  yeah
hes influential knows the area and probably has time to spare
sorry for keeping you
lets move forward with this idea
ok thank you
thanks talk to you soon
bring the guy booze
we cant have any delays and cant afford any more expenses
no time like the present
he shared a location hell be there till 1 pm
 then why do this  do what
i loved show business
i bet its not what you expected
no its full of scumbags just as i expected
ouch thats harsh
my soul
then you shouldnt be in this industry
yep i was even on some of his shows
wow you used to act
i was already burned out by then
so it didnt affect me
i wanna smack them
but chances come to those who dont chase them
its so strange and unfair
so you should just quit
zip it kid
hey im not that type of guy i can be sweet
what else would it be
no way i travel too much for work
maybe ill get married and quit this job
i should find a wife and move to the countryside
hope it works out
maybe the campsite caretaker should be me
 why not  ill get a dog too
yeah come visit
what a great plan
no big deal
no not yet
alright
we can wait
can i try that
put your strong foot forward
that felt great
 for table three  ok
im not a loafer
and i dont need the money
let me share something personal with you
see im a talent agent thats my main role
but i want to do something different
i was thinking of changing my career
thats why i want to learn more about this area
maybe you could start off by becoming my advisor
its on a deer trail
your glamping site
they can jump over two meters
you need a threemeter fence
thats got nothing to do with taste
thanks for coming
got enough water
ill go get some now
i have helpers
ill stay here a bit
ill do it
theyre hunting deer
its my first time hearing gunshots
they see people a lot
the deer here dont attack
youre sure
it might fight back if it cant run
wild deer are timid they avoid people
itll be a chance for city people to interact with wild animals
touching them is risky
they carry diseases
so they wont get touched
where would they go
call out if youre here hana
where could she be
too many places
maybe she went home
thats deep
sorry to trouble you
no its my fault
of course
make yourself at home theres food
ill come with you
this is a public announcement
a child has been reported missing
if you have any information please contact local law enforcement
i repeat
this is a public announcement
a child has been reported missing
she was last seen wearing a blue jacket

thank you
thank you
violette
thank you
mm
eugénie its delicious
who are you young lady
this is pauline my niece im looking after her today
thank you sir
all right
thank you
when youre done you can get the crayfish
the waters boiling
look well add the fish

thats good

ill prepare the quenelles
thank you
the vegetables violette
thank you
the rooster comb
violette please strain the butter
yes sir
thank you
pauline come here
 smell good  yes
taste it
remember the taste
youll compare once its been clarified
you recognise this sauce
no
can you name the ingredients
smoked bacon
red bell peppers
mushrooms
fennel
tomatoes
oranges
wine
parsley thyme
bay leaf
cumin
juniper berry
clove
carry on
theres also paprika and cognac
there you go
a bourguignotte sauce
bravo
astonishing girl
yes
here violette
the wine please
careful
you dip the ladle
then you drizzle
the stock over the egg white
to filter the scum
thats how you obtain a nice clear broth
go ahead
taste
is it different now that its clarified
yes its not as strong
before the flavour was stronger and coarser
now its more subtle
after all rabaz did a good deed today
and you beaubois
man is the only animal that drinks without thirst
wine is the intellectual side of a meal
meat and vegetables the material side
worse than hunger is not knowing when youll eat
heres rabaz
excuse me dear friends i had to go home and change
we could barely resist tasting the consommé
it whet my appetite
here
oh
what perfect expression
thank you
are you unwell eugénie
ill be fine
we owe antonin carême the volauvent
do you believe that story
were not historians
but we like a good story even if untrue
what an extraordinary fate
since his death kings have been dethroned
still stands
weeping he hears his father tell him
for him and his 14 siblings
even though he never left paris after that
wait do it slowly
ill start over
was the volauvent good
 its the best thing i ever ate  ah
finish your food
mm
mm
mm
yes
hm
closvougeot
well done rabaz
excellent
good old rabaz
mm
mm its fabulous
i have a nice story about closvougeot for you
in 1364 pope urban v
wanted to leave avignon and return to rome with his court
and oh my god
i agree grimaud all conversation must cease
when a truffled turkey appears
but this is merely veal loin with braised lettuce
had no desire to leave avignon
they imagined a wretched life far from their burgundy wines
resistance was so great
upon the death of urban v
his successor pope gregory xi
immediately annulled the threat of excommunication
so that his court might enjoy closvougeot again
mmm
violette
here
always impressive
magnificent
no not a miracle
merely a scientific reaction
 truly  the ice cream remains frozen
i see
 oh yes  hes the one who created
 absolutely  whats it called again
baked alaska
ok
sort of
whats it called
baked alaska
why alaska
eugénie
eugénie
thank you
we miss you in the dining room
yes why dont you ever eat with us
thats up to eugénie
its simply not possible
in the kitchen
i just
what more can i say
i
i inhaled its scent
i turned it stroked it every moment it was in this kitchen
texture and even taste
without having taken a bite
so this turbot did not give you more than i received
now gentlemen off to the salon
violette will serve liqueurs
youre an artist thank you
violette
they talk nonsense
they speak the truth
hewas an artist
who is he
antonin carême
why are their hats different
evoked a man getting out of bed
he slipped a cardboard disc inside
oh well
 mr dodin taught you to cook  no
i cooked long before i met him
then who taught you
a famous one too
but it was mainly my mother
he wasnt very patient
they died long ago
what did you feel at your first bite of baked alaska
 i almost cried  why
have you ever cried when you ate something
no
what do you think happened
listen to this
auguste escoffier and a certain césar ritz
are going to open a socalled palace in monte carlo
the first hotel of its kind
we live with the legacy of carême
merely 13 years
separate antonin carêmes death and the birth of escoffier
gentlemen
sir
there are five men in this room
i wish to address mr dodin
yes
please carry on
forgive me
as i was saying
hell never accept
please tell
his highness
that i accept his invitation
thank him warmly
these four gentlemen are my suite
i thank you in the name of the prince
gentlemen i wish you a pleasant evening
the napoleon
we were certain youd refuse
mm
i couldnt refuse
several days ago i was begged to accept it
when she tasted the baked alaska
i thought she would cry
one can have perfect pitch at age three
hm
i see its important to you
and not to you
apparently less than for you
tomorrow ill take pauline home and talk to her parents
hm
thank you
as you like
brings more joy to humanity than the discovery of a new star
eugénie
since when do you ask beforehand
knock
youll see if its open or not
if i ask its to ensure its not locked
youll see
i ask you once again
 marry me  mm
we study texts and recipes make them and eat them
and your wit makes me laugh
so tell me
mm
there is much witticism against marriage
you might like this one
marriage is a dinner that begins with dessert
ah
how dreadful
the first couple adam and eve started with dessert
mm
its true everything started with something they ate
sure
friday you have your weekly meeting with your banker
as your notary ill take the opportunity to give him
several deeds to put in his safe
very well
for the calves ill tell antonin hell meet you in the pen
unless something comes up ill be there too
ah
hello sweetheart
 hello  hello
 you ok  yes
hello hello
only six
ortolans eugénie buys them at the market
but theyre never as good as here
augustin gorges them with millet seed
he plucks them without gutting them and voilà
theyre almost done
with your permission id like to train pauline
 exceptional  its a great honour
pauline told me about your vegetable patch
 come  whats that
a copper antenna crowned with zinc
oh
theyre placed 20 feet apart
very surprising
what are they for
it makes the plants healthier and more robust
and our crop is better
 really  yes
the difference was striking
ah
thank you
thank you augustin
thank you
 mm  ooh
 oh  ooh
 augustin  thank you
 thank you and to the next round  ill get started
have you seen eugénie
yes
i heard you come in
but
how were the ortolans
its nothing
what about paulines parents
it went well
they agreed to her apprenticeship
no um
they didnt agree or disagree
 they want to think  oh
eugénie im worried
no hed be wasting his time
master with no pretentiousness intended
hearing a menu is always a pleasure
please read
the menu is comprised of three services
for the centre dish a yearling boar
with summer truffles
hors doeuvres
spitted partridges with herbs and essence of ham
poupetin of turtledoves and stuffed pike
the main entrées
two stuffed chickens in cream and young rabbits à la saingaraz
after the soup dry sherry
for the white wine
carbonnieux langon meursault and pouilly
for the red chainette thorins and saint estèphe
cyprus malvoisie and madeira will be served
the second course will have two entrées
before the four roast dishes
and torrent trout à la chartreuse
ribs of beef hollandaise
with sweetbreads in similar fashion
and quenelles from the same cut
there will be three sauces
piquante poor mans sauce and sky blue
and three salads herbs oranges and olives
the princes generosity turned into an ordeal
the prince believes that a gourmet should fear no menu
i thought my stomach would fail me
but my discomfort ended
and i surprisingly carried through to the end
what did dodin think
in short dodin saw the princes meal
abundant and rich but no light or clarity
no air no logic no line
custom but no rules a parade but no organisation
of flavours and textures
the almond pastries
which demand such attention were served after the ices
which paralyse and lull the senses
and before the cheeses
also iced
more precisely he said
that was it
the wines
though their order was not
the cigars
the ratafias and the eauxdevie too
mm
turkey breast in wine jelly and a fricassee of asparagus tips
and he went to bed
hes studying
a menu
 to invite the prince  yes
would you
yes of course
help yourself
hello augustin
hello eugénie
 a potaufeu  yes
he will serve the prince boiled beef and vegetables
thats it
one selects a cut of fresh beef
the meat is not rinsed to keep its juices
after removing the bones
then placed in a pot with one pint of water per pound of meat
incomprehensible
eugénie
eugénie
my friends
no
rabaz
eugénie whats wrong
i fell asleep
 dont move dont move  huh
whats wrong
 what happened  im fine
 fell asleep  yes
oh everyones here
yes come with us
careful
ill help you
lean on me
nothing serious
ill bring you some medication later
you need rest
be reasonable and stay in bed
and im a friend
trust me would you
ok
thank you
get some rest
ill walk the good doctor out and be right back
your broth is delicious
any time you like
its my pleasure
you have better things to do violette can cook for me
violette
mm
she can barely boil water
serious
even grave
 do i  mm
the wit i love so much is gone
whats wrong
when i
when i found you in the garden
i thought
die myself
i feel full of life
im so happy
and grateful
unless its against the good doctors recommendations
of course
of course
you can send an invitation to the prince whenever you like
im well and ready
unless you arent
uh
i have a better idea
violette
thank you
remember
last year i purchased three bottles in a london auction
an 1837 krug clos dambonnay champagne
when the boat transporting 2000 bottles to america was shipwrecked
everything is still here
thank you
thank you
may i watch you eat
if you want
an 11th century chinese poet
obeyed one rule his entire life
he worked one year
then devoted the entire next year to his wife
i should have followed his example
for example youre neither a poet nor chinese
im not a poet
the napoleon of gastronomy
and many other names but not poet
lets say not yet
and there was the word wife
im working on that
ill be back
the teeth
yes the teeth
break up the food
next the glands of all species
moisten it inside the mouth
the tongue mixes the food by moving it around
then presses it against the palate
to release the juices
and savour the flavour
it rises in the middle
forming a slope at its base
it transports the food to the oesophagus
but with you eugénie
this activity
is absolutely beautiful
wonderful
yes sir
you can go now
careful the plate must be facing a certain way
yes i know
friends
dear friends
eugénie and i
have decided to wed in our autumn years
not autumn
reassure me you know nothing of autumn pauline
its also a fine season for gastronomy
aw
in autumn
the grape harvests bring cool winds game and good cheer
and though quails warblers and corncrakes depart
the woodpigeon woodcock and duck arrive
from the other end of the world to whet our appetite
caused by the summer heat
in normandy apples are harvested with sticks
to embellish and vary our sweet courses
in autumn one dines by candlelight
thats true
ducks and wild geese travel from north to south
autumn is the transition from the frugal joys of summer
to the solid pleasures of winter
eugénie let us wed in autumn
bravo
bravo
the guests were pleased i think
we are fortunate to have such enjoyable friends
i love summer
dont you
but the summer sun
i love the burning sensation
i need that sensation
inside my body
i understand
come in
this is now your room too
so
here we go
dainties before the soup
eugénie chatagnes soup
mm
brillatsavarins fritters
dodins potaufeu
soubise purée
dessert
there
 and thats all  yes
mm
its
hazardous
and audacious
and
theres the potaufeu
i know what you think
these three vulgar words are inglorious and scented with grease
but boiled beef and vegetables
is so french
thus i take up the challenge
to marvel the prince with my own personal potaufeu
with your help of course
thank you
hm
it doesnt frighten me
and you
do you sense me wavering
 yes  why would i be afraid
eugénie
eugénie
whats wrong violette
you agree dear colleague
come now this is absurd
youre not here to define medicine
yet its useful
it explains why we dont know certain things
so you dont know whats wrong with eugénie you know nothing
we dont know if its serious or not
or how it might evolve
lets hope so
yes lets hope
only hours ago you fainted in my arms
im sorry i scared you
but only an hour later i felt fine
thank you for coming all this way
to give our friend dr rabaz a second opinion
the two of you agree im perfectly well
youd find a healthy woman
thank you
i know i was unreasonably anxious
right now
im reassured that youre well
some of my nights you know
but the other nights
more than anything
are numerous
far too numerous
there are also many nights when
walking from your room to mine
 noiselessly  my heart pounding each time
something extraordinary happened twice
i imagined you quietly coming out of your room
turn right and go down the hallway
twice
only twice during all these years
the very moment i imagined you opening my door
it really opened
violette
violette
its eugénie
can you go see
you dont want to eat
i can make you something simple
thank you im fine
you havent eaten in two days its not reasonable
i dont need you anymore
i dreamt i was humanitys first cook
or the first male cook
i told eugénie my dream like i told you
but i realise now
eugénie needed exceptional intuition
and a perfect understanding of the man you are
lets give dodin our suggestions
well see
yes
we cant just do nothing
i have faith in this list of cooks
does dodin have faith
eugénie was a very beautiful woman
 hm  hm
who will talk to dodin
not me in any case
i might have an idea
we know what dodin eats for breakfast
eugénie
whats that
whats going on
violette
who are you
who said you could wear that apron
sir
take it off
go
go
go i said
why did you
we apologise
speak of it no more
weve drawn up a list of cooks
no
sir
gentlemen
maam sir
forgive us for coming unannounced
no harm done maam
how is pauline
shes very unhappy
ever since eugénies death
without a qualified cook
it would be impossible
we understand and weve explained the situation but
very well we understand
thank you for hearing us out
pauline
despite her young age
forgive me for asking you this
of course
ill speak to her
thank you
mr dodin
here is a list of candidates
that we drew up together
and cut the fillets into equalsized pieces
trim them
meanwhile melt butter in a large skillet
sprinkle the fillets with salt
baste them with a bit of melted butter
when its time put them on the stove
pour maître dhôtel sauce over the fillets
to which you have added reduced velouté
and extra lemon
very well sir
thank you miss you may leave
very well sir
here taste
thank you
perfectly cooked
 your veal fricandeau  thank you
this very complex soup
has singular oldfashioned charm
it must have one flavour
but each part of this flavour
broadly speaking it should be reminiscent of a sonatas development
where each theme retains its own life and individual flavour
within the blended power and harmony of the whole
heres the recipe please read it carefully
yes of course very well in fact
it was named after her
but if you think i could learn it from you
please let me know
goodbye sir
you can take them off the stove
salt and pepper
im coming
and prevents the aromas from escaping
when the dough is cooked the pot is sealed
and cook it gently over a low flame
pauline wake up
were going to make a potaufeu
pauline wake up
put this on the stove
thats good
help me
well you like it
no you dont
its normal youre too young
bone marrow
is very complex
it takes culture and a good memory to shape ones taste
this is what marrow must taste like
remember it
 yes sir  good
there
skimming spoon
thank you
just wet your lips
its good
it makes the meat taste even better
chambolle musigny
it has everything class elegance pureness
a long finish
and an extraordinary bouquet
the food we made is very good
but its like an outline or a sketch
twenty years
we cooked every day
i read a recipe and she worked magic on the stove
i miss her
when she spoke to me
i watched her mouth and her eyes as intensely as i listened
but now
its over
forgive me for bursting in
id better come back later
grimaud
grimaud
actually it cant wait
then come in
i was having lunch at an acquaintances home
after a consommé of sturgeon bone marrow
dazzling
this dish appeared
i quickly came here
mm sea bream
sweetbreads sautéed in butter
with foie gras
id never paired them together
morel mushrooms
are the springtime
the blend of sweetbreads and celeriac is muted subdued
not explosive and very enveloping
the cucumber
and the lemons note of acidity bring freshness to this construction
with the fish its another story
which retains its natural savour
a fine encounter of earth and sea
that praises the beauty of the land
grimaud this is admirable
the guests were pleased i think
yes
speak for yourself im in the summer of my life
i love summer
the first snowflakes
the first chimney fires
the first buds
but the summer sun
i understand
weve lived under the same roof for over 20 years
how have you kept your constancy and perseverance with me
st augustin said
happiness
my cook
thank you
am i scared
i too was scared first time
who will know unless you tell
police laughs
you think all this is happening without the knowledge of police
still none other than the people registered like knows about
the existence of one such concept
what will exactly happen now after we go there

please leave me
this is yours and this is yours
enjoy the hell

welcome to lucifer and im the lucifer
previously when i faced such a situation i killed my own wife to fall out
destroy each and every proof now ok
what now shiva we have an option
a lie has more value than truth in this world
we should make them believe if truth is said
i dont feel this is so easy shiva
thus adding sentiment to a lie will work stronger than cement
still why would one of us die
how can you do this to me shiva
you shouldnt love more than life diya
oh no
that too because of a girl
because of this phone
how many phones are required
what idiot
what idiot are you getting angry
hey satya
what happened brother
details of everyone they kidnapped are here in these year wise folders
people committing crime so organised will be very particular
details of all orphans who applied for jobs in it are matching here
with those they kidnapped
so they are targeting only orphans that means
shiva should be the lucifer behind this what
theyve killed 6000 people till date
then how
only option is me going there
that is very dangerous he may kill even you
i already lost the girl i liked
now i cant lose even the girl i loved
brother take this air tag and your location will be known
oh no
ill accept youre great idiot
30 minutes or 15 minutes
thats enough to show the hell
we shouldnt get caught even if this place is found
and get that bitch
death means not just to lose the life

 how does a brain go into overdrive  what do you mean
no not if we stay awake
it looks like youre in a lockdown
at blackwood safety is our number one priority
its an automated security protocol at the newer facilities
amir for containing threats
for 24 hours the facility is sealed
and all lines of communication are cut off
how did it happen
there has to be some way to override it
thats the whole point
the head of the company could be in here it wouldnt matter
hey go easy ray
 ugh  theyve got to last us all night
amir weve all got five yeah
no no hey
i wouldnt even drink coffee
its like
okay imagine your brain is a computer and its on fire
okay no no thats a bad metaphor
uh
imagine your brain is a car and its on fire
thats why so long as we stay awake were alright
it sounds worse than it is
as you can see not looking so sexy
but enduring
youre gonna wear yourself out
still 20 hours to go
someone needs to make a record of whats happening here
actually yeah youre right
malpractice
these are just words
were human beings
the wrong that has been done to us here
can you put a price on our suffering
nice

im just tracking our progress
keeping an eye on things

okay
im sure ill have this cracked in no time
oh
me neither
me neither
oh clanging
thud ah
hey
this is it you realise that
they have already written us off and theyre right
so weve got two options
we can sit around waiting to be rescued
or we work together and we find a way out
i dont know about you but im tired of waiting
did an 8 year old draw this
this is where theyve sealed us off
all we need to do is break through that wall
and were out
great so thats one vote for dont try
i thought you looked cold
what
paul hey
 i think this is it im almost through  what
paul yeah yeah pull it
yeah yeah
now
no no no no
what
no no
no fuck
no
its the same as the door theres no getting through that
but look its one wall
we can try another one we can tear the whole place down if we have to
why would the next wall be any different
 weve gotta take those uppers  no
its the only way well get through this
why are we even listening to him
alright ill go talk to him
how did he know
how did how did you know amir
how did he know
i mean he was right so
yeah but how did he know
ive been on way more trials than anyone
and ive never seen any shit like this
he knows blackwood i guess
knows how they work
maybe he already has one
one person who can run tests
hes not your typical lab rat
hesitates okay
lets find out
we really need you in here
you were right about the wall
amir
im sorry
i havent been honest with you
this is for you
and the others
its all my fault
i caused the lockdown
i broke their security and tried to make copies of our mri scans
i was so stupid
i should have known what would happen
amir no
amir get up
 i told you theres no way out  theres no way out
our brain is a car right
can we jumpstart it
wait for real i just gave you an idea
but with these side effects
 but is that a plan or just gibberish  i dont know you tell me
im on board lets catalyse that shit
 ill go tell the others  okay
 i dont think we can trust amir  what why
that sounds like one of rays guinea pig campfire tales
i know i thought so too
i wasnt sure
its the uppers he told us not to take
paul
something must have tripped i think i saw the fuses before
its okay
come on
oh yes yes im not finding it
paul fuck my phones dead
 close your eyes

ill try it
well make it ill test it
what have we got to lose

amir
amir
start adding the iodine
weve only got one shot at this
 you tripped the fuse  i didnt trip the fuse
its a sedative fast acting
if you cover me then i can get to amir
damn thats a lot better than my plan
im too fucking tired
amir okay youre almost there
i mean yeah but
so walk me through again whats about to happen
you take the formula it makes you stroke out
you should know though if it doesnt work itll kill you instantly
considering what weve been through if we had to do this again
i probably wouldnt sign up for this trial
so when they asked me to come on this trial
i thought they saw someone focused
determined
willing to put everything into their career
no friends no connections to anyone
thats not much of a goal
its a start
paul okay
i think
i think its ready
vanessa
claire vanessa ray vanessa
claire get her up ray vanessa

christ watch out
ah
blackwood pharmaceuticals were today cleared
that doctor ellen burke had been running a rogue trial
and blackwood had no knowledge of her actions
male voice we feel vindicated
but still mourn the great loss of life
hopefully this puts an end
to any conspiracy theories circulating
which are an insult to both the victims
blackwood remain committed to our vision
nothing will stand in our way

also if youd kindly give me safe phrase

safe phrase
a series of four words
that will trigger an immediate shutdown
that is eight words
my analysis has suggested
‘architect bolivia castle descartes
these words follow the abc format
relate to significant moments in your life
and are unlikely to be used unintentionally
would this be appropriate
yes
robotic whir safe phrase initiated
catchy ‘architect bolivia castle

someone who knows everything about you

hmm
paul calls that one ‘the nike swoosh chuckles
it has many informal names
‘the nike swoosh is not one of them
the literal translation of ursa major is ‘greater shebear
to the palaeolithic era
would you like me to continue sharing information
no no its fine
lets just sit for a while

paul seemed really worried about you

safe phrase initiated
shutting down
partys 100th anniversary
has developed socialism with chinese characteristics
they created a miracle
to ensure the fulfillment happiness and security of its people
it also comes from within our nation
to actively participate in security matters
he watches over us
another one here
hello is this your car
to notify the owner
nothing so far just some illegal parking
we must stay alert to risks
the waves are rough
what are you writing
daddy come back soon
great
last summer
he played football with me
my husband is a lawyer
the police arrested him on january 12th 2020
on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power
i am innocent
youll be like him when you grow up
remember his mustache
not really
i only knew he was a lawyer
can you tell me about dads cases
his clients were usually petitioners
the government wanted to suppress them
some people petition because
its like overnight they lost their
so the government sees defense lawyers as obstacles
sometimes he asks me what would dad think about this
what would he do
i think he misses his dad
since the metoo movement
weiping chang reached out to me
so i wrote an article
in december 2019
they discussed politics chinas future career obstacles
soon after the meeting they were arrested
weiping chang was put under designated residential surveillance for over ten days
later under house arrest in his hometown of shaanxi
during the ten months he waited for his trial
chang recorded over 200 video diaries
the walnut trees have bloomed
this bougainvillea is out but see
look at the big walnut tree
today i want to show you more
in his video diary on october 16th 2020
while under arrest
they held me at the baotai hotel
all day for ten days
this extreme torture
4 few days later he was arrested again
on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power
if a country cant tolerate someone like him
the country is the problem
let me introduce the llvision ar glasses
in a large crowd these glasses can
identify a suspicious person fast
on the front and back doors of the bus
our facial recognition feature can pick up on that
and alert their supervisor to get ahead of the problem
its great during rush hour
its fast and convenient
i think it shows how society is progressing
but it looks like its for surveillance
a peephole camera like ours
in the past
they said we are a family of traitors
they want our neighbours to isolate us
what do you think about that
its the truth
our phones and apps are monitored
they make changes to our profiles
it worked
but when i tried to upload anything with my face in it
i got a violation notice and my account was banned
when i was first released last year
it didnt bother me that much
only because we fought hard for human rights
many victims of wrongful convictions came to us
they manipulated various legal cases
 to draw public attention
2025 they politically manipulated sensitive legal cases
20and directed their dissatisfaction2 to the government
some were forced to write a confession
the total number of people ultimately arrested was about 27
only a handful were taken to trial
lawyers were forced to plead guilty on tv
i refused
so they shamelessly imprisoned me for a long time
i told you
its for your own good
you are a lawyer you should know better
you just need to handle it well
who are you 
cant we volunteers ask you to provide identification
but did you register when you came in
i scanned the code
it divides every community into grids
and assigns an officer to each one
ne manage all kinds of residential matters and complaints
where have you been
i was taking out the trash
 there are special residents we keep an eye on
hi auntie i work for the commun
the one with the charging cord
ne are given a watch list by a higher level of government
are put on the list
it causes us a lot of stress
the development of technologies like facial recognition
will make our work easier
to resolve conflicts at the grassroots level
we rely on the nations 45 million grid officers
the sharp eyes project is another essential national project
with upgraded tv cable
chinas sky net project is the worlds largest video surveillance network
last week the police told me they saw my article
they said the way its written feels like you
in 20191 witnessed and wrote articles about
because of my reporting
s® even if i wear ajnask
when i talk in public if the big data system is in place
they can identify me by my voice
hello
we are by no means violent
even in countries like the us
subversion of state power is prosecuted
but in china theres no clear legal definition of it
the police manipulate its definition
my plan now is to petition to government branches in beijing
will that be a problem
its legal and logical
but your personal safety cannot be guaranteed
the authorities have no shame
they can easily escort me back to my hometown and lock me up
but i still want to try how will i know if i dont
 our son was only twoandahalf years old when his father was arrested
before that i was a housewife
i felt like the sky was falling
that was a turning point for me
i became very close with other wives
victimised by the 709 crackdown
quanzhang wang
and figure out how to find my husband
no attorneyclient meeting for quanzhang wang
which department gave this order
 doesnt specify  doesnt specify
quanzhang wang has disappeared since 987 days
this is our 27th attempt at filing a mandate
we try to hold out we wont give up
were fighting for you too
what are you doing
do you want your children to live a life without freedom too
do you think your comfortable life will be guaranteed forever
were also fighting for you
what are you doing
let us out
did you hear that
we are here to petition
why are you illegally detaining us
you need to follow the law
this camera is to watch my mum
im not opening the door
m your friend
what are you doing
theyre my guests
why are you hitting them bastards stop
the police are beating people
you are polluting the whole community
im sorry
a lot of people said they cried when they saw the video of my return
i didnt feel anything
when i was in secret detention
during that time
the word that most frequently comes to mind
is report
report i need to raise my hand
report i need to blink
report i need to eat
no approval
at one point
was lying in bed like a dead body
if i moved even a little bit
would get punished
this is fengxian county
im zijuan chen wife of chinese human rights lawyer weiping chang
free my dad
sure either chinese or english is okay
 dont hold it like a memorial portrait  im not
stop wasting time im getting angry
fine
im going to get mad
in some dark places
i think weiping chang is like these fireflies
release my dad
lets try again
dont break it
i wont
im very anxious
full of danger
people who stand up are targeted right
but if nobody comes forward things will never change
thats why i can totally relate to weiping chang
they tried that a few times
apart from that
they forced me to drink alcohol
 alcohol  to get me drunk
they wanted me to sign away my rights while drunk
now they take a more individualised approach
they use big data against you
one of them said i know your period is close
i cooked this broth for you drink it while its still warm
and later let me warm it up for you
in that situation even though i knew they had an agenda
1 couldnt help feeling  moved
not yet 1  hurry up we need to go
lets go lets go
 bye dont forget your laptop  and face mask
 whats wrong  somebodys outside
lets go
 you cant leave  why not
we cant tell you
 who are you  you dont need to know that
youre being ridiculous
dont overreact
you asked me to give you my child
would you hand your child over to a stranger
someone will come and answer your questions
i dont know you when did you see me
i accompanied him to his physical exam
but there isnt any danger
foreign embassies have invited us to participate in events for human rights day
police restricting our freedom without legal excuse is a violation of human rights
after i was arrested
on days they consider to be politically sensitive
that it seems almost normal
but no
we need to break this pattern using the law
my way is to cook delicious food for you all
i can do something as well
i plan to file formal administrative complaints
but i have to take care of myself first
lawyer quanzhang wang can you hear me
can hear you
at the same time
people like lawyer jiaxi ding dr zhiyong xu and lawyer weiping chang
means living a comfortable life
generations of control
have made people internalise censorship
just like the media
we give in they take more
i will uphold the partys programme
observe the provisions of the party constitution
and never betray the party
they will never say thats enough
volunteer activities are registered in the rongcheng community app
like night patrols home cleaning recycling and many other activities
on this app there is also a ranking system
if they dont remind them
please keep an eye out for improper parking and notify the owners
cooking for the elderly
over the past two days i spent ten hours volunteering
volunteering for ten hours gets you two points
we need to thank the party
and be grateful to live in this country
showing remorse and studying moral lessons
can individuals repair their damaged social credit score
take myself as an example
and they defaulted on it
it can also limit travel by highspeed trains or by plane
if youre a party member and want to get promoted
you dont stand a chance
theres no doubt about that
rongcheng city has developed
the public seems to accept and participate in these programs 
we sent each major officer a petition letter
but did those letters help
we didnt get any responses though
theres nothing better i can do
hello everyone i am zijuan chen
we wrote a total of 52 petition letters this weekend
really
the oranges are sweet its getting cold
lets see how long it takes them to delete this post
video uploaded
the houses all look the same
yes thats the typical style here
this is changs parents house
hello
youre back
yes i just got back
now i have a camera pointing at my house
the more i think about it the more upset i get
its dried
ill make you want to die rather than live
ill make you jump into a river
if it gets worse your son may have trouble going to school too
you have a long road ahead
weipings case will last for years
even before the 709 crackdown police often came to my house
he was depressed
we can continue to file for mandate
who is that
who is that
nobody
no one
oh its you jongan
what are you doing here
how did you know we were here nobodys been home for months
i was thinking
no
stop by later if you get a chance
in the future
fare evasion soliciting eating and drinking on the subway
smart neighbourhood
smart logistics
smart dining
smart life
she came by out of the blue
someone must have sent her to check on us
but after the protest
this is the communist party warning us
we should rethink our behaviour
you asked me to protest i did
or put him in more danger
just because of some surveillance cameras
you chicken out
you immediately give up
dont blame everything on me
you said you are a party member so you wont protest
yes i said that
you are a communist party member for life
to be honest im scared
you are a communist party member go ahead and be loyal
hello kitten wang
you hid your treat there
cant reach it
how do you write the character all
that pen is mine
sowhat if i borrow it
your teacher would tell you the same thing
my teacher has never said that
how can i even look it up
youve got your dictionary
yes
you know how to pronounce it
everything you do is annoying
okay if you find it annoying
i wont say anything
when i was arrested
whenever i argue with him
he says things like go back to prison
since he was absent for five years
he feels a lot of guilt towards our son
the love that was missing for the past five years
from big things to tiny everyday things
because hes actually anxious
so i need an escape
i need to find a way out
i am restricted in my work
but there are still some cases i can take on
demolition of urban houses
so they told you it was for building a research facility
but now theyre saying its for commercial purposes
yes
when people from other areas come to buy houses in our villages
real estate certificate
or are you talking about the previous property ownership certificate
in 2015 hundreds of human rights lawyers were arrested
the government accused us of inciting petitioners to cause trouble
but in fact we were helping petitioners
the news broadcast this crackdown
however i never pled guilty
i think she has some concerns because of my past
they still need my help
personally i want to work with you
but i cant speak for my son
i cant force my ideas on him
turn right
hi dad im doing my homework
talk to your dad
im going to do my homework now
i cant go out
i cant speak
scream but no one can hear me
checking in at noodle restaurant
even the bravest ones have been restrained
others are taking a step back
people like us who hold the middle ground
all of this was unimaginable before f
in the past journalists could write reports and change an evil law
i was arrested and put under residential surveillance
intimidating me or trying to be my friend
anything they could do to break me
i pushed back quoting actual laws as my rebuttals
they wanted to record a video of me pleading guilty
they said no
i said ok thats fine
sing the song of angry men
on the fourth day i went to the camera and prepared to read 1984 again
but it was gone
are we near baoji city
one of our phones isnt safe
i didnt call anyone
hello
we must have been tracked via our phone signals
and they were notified 
lets go
i want to beat that scumbag to death
we are here
it was over 2000 kilometers
i want to know if hes safe
weiping chang
our son and i came to see you all the way from shenzhen
dad
come back quickly
after several months of torture in a designated location
he had blood in his stool
 mum yes
give me a bowl
go get it from the kitchen
in the case of weiping changs subversion of state power
its statutory duties
my son was born into a modern society and grew up under the red flag
he loves and is loyal to his motherland
its my 36th birthday today
these little kids still call me big brother
i feel flattered and very happy
i should have been called uncle
his trial date is finally set
find out how hes doing
you must wear a mask you must have your temperature checked
you must show your health code
it was weiping changs birthday
in front of the provincial police department
when i tried to enter the flower shop
my health code turned yellow
i did not test positive for covid
nor was i exposed to anyone who tested positive
1 please scan your health code
not approved
i dont know which department turned your code yellow
its not our business
you cant even leave your compound
after covid peoples trust in the government
 we must absolutely uphold the zerocovid strategy
henan bank return my deposits
recently in the henan province
you have broken the law
big data knows all your activities
it can take total control of the people
living in an environment like this
makes me feel like an animal in a cage
every code must be scanned
everyone should be checked
no one should be left unscanned
april 1st 2022
everyone is shouting were out of food
the police are beating us
what are you doing
i dreamed that i was dead
my soul was out of my body i saw my dog coming in
someone was wrapping up my body
i recognised that person he was a member of the secret police
but there are 80 million party members
when i woke up i felt hopeless and i broke down i kept crying
later i thought
my plan for the future is
but i also see rebellion among the younger generations
i want to be part of that to preserve some seeds of hope
let the seeds sprout
take the next exit on the right in 500 metres to go to fengxian

please forgive him dear
oh no no no your husband is right mrs duperon
as one would hope

for my fathers ignorance

you know this house was given to my family
yep
apparently we read the entire surrounding
snakes

walden dean

two most important days in your life are the day youre born

nothing
hey its ok george
ok
thank you
todays court case is bad
bad man
very bad man
you saw that candy bar right
yep
i like candy bars too
anything else outstanding about mr pym
its over
mr patel substantial bruising
his feet were badly deformed from what looked
deitrich heavy bandaging
a sustained and painful treatment
the only patient at the blessed retirement facility
to have sustained such terrible injuries
mr patel there were whispers about the brf
but not much more than that
mills was overseeing these patients
slapping his father across the face
for not taking his medication
objection your honor
25 years of impeccable service in the medical profession
systematically tortured his unfortunate patients who
subsequently died from nothing to do with bandaged feet
or bruised buttocks
im sorry your honor but defense is deflecting
from an observation of violence which clearly lends
itself to a mode of behavior
ms deitrich did anybody actually see
nurse mills binding these poor peoples feet
or whipping them with a
no your honor no witnesses
im sorry but i
owing to chief nurse mills impeccable record
or actual evidence no eyewitnesses no leather belt
for dismissal of all charges
theres nothing wrong with me
theyre probably just trying to beat that stupid steno record
do yourself a favor son and quit that damn competition
