Mom.
A Hundred Flowers
Mom!
I...
I want to see fireworks.
Half fireworks.
I missed you.
Don't.
Izumi?
Sorry about the mess.
It's so late. I'll hurry.
Take your time.
That was quick. Like a magic trick.
No, it's fine.
I was lazy this year.
I bought the New Year's dishes readymade at the store.
I'm gonna eat.
It's a shame Kaori couldn't come.
She always works on New Year's Eve.
But she enjoys her job.
Oh yeah?
Happy new year.
Happy new year.
And happy birthday.
It's Kaori.
Happy new year.
Okay. Have you eaten?
No...
Izumi?
I'll be home soon.
You should stay longer.
Yeah?
Okay.
I'll call you when I leave.
Trouble at work. I have to go.
A junior colleague...
is in a jam.
Business as usual even over the holidays.
There's your baby.
Around 6 centimeters.
- Tennis ball? - Yeah.
Maybe a bit smaller.
- More like a pingpong ball. - Pingpong...
A ball, either way.
I can't think of another analogy. Any ideas?
I like that.
Don't you, Daddy?
- Daddy? - Yes.
See this? It's the heart.
It's beating.
It is... Pretty cute.
Don't you think?
What a relief.
Hey.
You lied, didn't you?
About what?
It looked cute to me. I mean it.
Yeah, right.
I'm almost in the second trimester. We should tell your mom.
But you always forget.
I won't.
Did I tell you she called?
Wow.
It's pretty big.
- I think it's a carp. - Carp?
- Yeah. - Carp, huh?
She thought I was you. It made her laugh.
She's looking forward to the fireworks.
She said half fireworks are really pretty.
Half? What's that?
I thought you'd know.
- She didn't mention it? - No.
Did you hear KOE's debut is delayed?
Again?
Tanabe needs more time.
Osawa must be pissed.
I can't blame her. It's like an experiment.
I'll catch up with you. I'm gonna call Mom.
Now? The meeting starts at 11.
Music. Voice. Looks.
And to construct her personality
In creating her appearance using deep learning...
she's sleeping with Director Osawa.
You're oblivious about these things.
KOE also generates the melody and lyrics.
- Hey... - Yes?
Is this hodgepodge of data really going to sell?
Further adjustments will bring out her individuality.
Like 6 months ago.
You think Kaori knows?
Be careful, girls!
Be careful, girls!
Eggs.
Be careful, girls!
Asaba?
Asaba...
Asaba!
Asaba, wait!
Asaba!
Please!
Asaba!
Ow!
Asaba!
we're gonna have a baby.
Kaori is pregnant.
A baby?
August.
I'm so happy.
We won't press charges today.
Can we see the footage again?
Yes.
For Alzheimer's patients,
But only by several months to 5 years tops.
But the cause is still unknown.
Ms. Yuriko Kasai will be back soon.
You'll have to support her in every way you can.
Dementia patients
It doesn't change the fact that Yuriko Kasai is your mother.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom?
Mom...
Should I stop giving piano lessons?
Miku who lives down the street is my only student now.
I have to find a caregiver.
Hello? Izumi hasn't come home.
Is he here?
Ms. Nikaido?
I'm not a child.
"Wait, Zeus.
I was born an honest man.
Let me die an honest man.
Shoving aside people in his way
Melos ran like a black wind.
Dashing through a party in the meadows
As he ran past a group of travellers
he heard something ominous.
That man must be on the crucifix by now.
Ah, that man... It's for that man I'm running like this.
Ms. Nikaido!
It started raining so I went to get the laundry.
I didn't notice her leaving.
Did you call the police?
I just did. They're looking for her now.
I'll look around the neighborhood.
Okay.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom...
Yes?
This way.
Izumi...
Where were you? I looked everywhere for you.
Mom...
But I'm so relieved. I finally found you.
You must be glad he's safe.
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.
It was getting dark out and it started to rain.
Izumi...
It's no wonder his teacher called on him.
He read Run, Melos! when I went to his school on parents' day.
Another mom said to me...
- Sunflowers already. - Yeah.
Really? Why?
I don't remember why.
You don't?
Are you okay?
- 200 yen. - Okay.
Thank you.
I'll hold it.
Maybe we could move in with her.
But it's already been decided.
I doubt that.
Whenever I see the sea, I remember that big fish.
Fish?
A big one, 30 centimeters long.
Yeah.
What was that lake called?
We stayed at a lakeside inn.
You don't have to. Besides, you're having a baby soon.
Give her a warm welcome.
Hello. I'm Yuriko Kasai.
Nice to meet you too.
You've made such progress. Very nice.
I want a rabbit.
What about you?
Let's see.
A lion!
a rabbit.
You can have a lion.
It's good.
I found another one. Here.
Is there another rabbit?
I like it.
Get me a flower, okay?
Hello. Kasai residence.
Hello?
Grandma... It's Izumi.
Is everything okay?
Mom...
"Dementia"
"Izumi's wife is Kaori"
"Don't buy too many eggs"
"Yuriko Kasai, born January 1"
"10:00 tomorrow, Ms. Nikaido (caregiver)"
"Always have a flower in the house"
Yuriko, come here.
Hanshin Railway.
Hanshin's tracks are standard gauge.
Too bad.
That's the fun part.
So you'll be home by 6:00?
Yeah.
Play the G in CEG softly but clearly.
I rushed it.
Sorry to show up suddenly.
I'm happy you came.
What are you making?
Omelet rice.
Is ketchup flavor okay?
Can you still play it?
Of course.
I was surprised you wanted to learn this piece.
Really?
CEGCEG...
Yuriko?
Megumi?
I thought it was you.
You haven't changed.
Do you live in Kobe now?
Yeah...
When did you move here?
Around 3 months ago.
Don't run!
A university in Kobe.
They offered me a professorship.
Be careful, girls.
Hey! Stop that!
Megumi... I better get going.
Okay...
We're not home at the moment. Please leave your name and message.
Yuriko, it's me.
I'm still working on my paper so I won't need dinner tonight.
Sorry.
The meter is moving.
Hello. Do you live here?
What can I do for you?
We're from the police.
between 12:00 and 14:00?
No. I was out.
You see...
There was a burglary in this apartment building.
I think you're fine.
Just in case, will you check your family photos and albums?
He's not after cash.
He takes photo albums and travel souvenirs.
Everything looks in place.
I see.
Yuriko Asaba.
Happy new year.
I had no idea what to get.
I was completely stumped.
How could I forget?
Like us.
Wasn't that cheesecake delicious?
Didn't that cassis sauce bring back memories?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Strawberries are in season now. Thanks.
Enjoy.
Yum.
No. I stayed here.
Lucky you. I had to spend it with my inlaws.
Scary. Were you okay?
Yeah. We were safe.
Apparently, the thief only took photo albums and souvenirs.
That's like getting your memories stolen.
Isn't it?
My diary.
What do you write about?
I can't tell anyone...
so I write in my diary.
Asaba?!
Izumi...
Izumi...
Izumi.
Izumi!
Izumi!
Izumi!
Which do you want?
That's a camel.
Ms. Nikaido, thanks for coming such a long way.
Mom, this is Kaori.
Oh, right. Miku.
How you've grown.
Listen, Mom. This is Kaori.
My wife.
She's lovely.
Thank you for coming.
The baby will be born this month.
Congratulations.
Let's see...
Where's my rabbit?
All those years ago...
Why did you abandon me?
The weather's nice. A walk in the garden?
Yuriko?
Yes.
Are you pregnant?
Izumi...
I'm sure...
But...
I don't regret what I did.
Since you're feeling so well, you should go out.
Fireworks?
Fireworks festival sounds great.
Whoa... I have 27 unread emails.
Your mom seemed well.
Really?
I kept thinking stuff like that.
I see.
When I was in grade school.
I suspected something had happened.
Can't you forgive her?
Here. Half fireworks.
They actually exist?
It's what you wanted to see.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Sorry. Excuse me.
Mom!
hasn't come home.
Sorry. Coming through.
Mom!
Mom...
You're the one who gets lost.
You get lost on purpose
I...
want to see half fireworks.
Mom...
I wanna see half fireworks! I wanna, I wanna!
Megumi eats the strawberry first.
I always envied her.
A thief stole my photo albums and souvenirs.
My memories were stolen and...
Huh?
Mom...
Who...
Mom!
No! No!
No!
Who are you?
How could you forget?
That presentation was a total flop.
Mr. Osawa, you're the project manager.
Nagai, thanks for overseeing it for me.
- I worked hard for Tanabe. - Hey...
Thanks.
Good job.
Thank you.
Seriously...
You did good.
She has all these random memories.
But no real identity in the end.
Maybe we should've given KOE the ability to forget.
She's practicing the piano for a recital at the nursing home.
She can play?
Yeah? But we also pretty much forget everything too.
Almost finished?
Yeah, almost.
We should donate what we can and get rid of the rest.
I'll call you.
Hinata, say bye to Granny.
Byebye.
- See you later. - Be safe.
Beautiful.
The most beautiful fireworks I've ever seen.
Yeah?
Yeah.
something so beautiful?
Never.
Because they're special.
You're right.
Mom...
Half fireworks.
Hey...
Do you see them?
- Lion. - A lion!
Rabbit.
Go, Izumi.
- So big. - Yeah.
Here.
Happy birthday.
In times of yore, an avenging spirit was thought to inhabit old people.

You know how hot it makes me.

Hey, lovely bride!
Malick, Ella's here!

Uh-huh. And Grandpa told you all that.
[Noah] That was over a hundred years ago.

People's Public Security
Yo, college dude, there's a rule here, keep it clean and tidy.
Our captain is particularly concerned.
Got it.
Captain Cui,
My name Sun Jiandong.
I heard you're good at drawing.
but always dreamed to become a cop. So I went to the Public Security University.
We've never had a college kid here before.
In here,
the publicity department, they may need your help.
But I specialize in criminal investigation.
What's the rush, Director Zhuo?
The K3 train heist
with the greatest endeavor.
The Criminal Investigation Bureau,
the Railway Public Security Bureau,
the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Beijing Railway Public Security Bureau,
to arrest the criminals, and bring them back for trail.
We cannot let anyone get away!
The Chinese community in Moscow is not big.
We are completely exposed, while the enemies are hidden in the shadows.
I need Kazimir Gang from Manzhouli as well.
Consul Zhang from Chinese Embassy in Russia,
Legan Superyision Department
Did you steal or snatch?
Yamamoto Isoroku?
Why don't you call yourselt Yokomicho Keiji?
Fake passport?
You're quite bold.
Tell me! Where did all this come from?
No, no, no...
I didn't get on that train.
What train?
I didn't mention any particular train.
I dare you!
Suck it back!
I'll tell you what,
Whether you are the mastermind or an accomplice,
I am giving you a chance now.
If you tell everything you know now, I'll consider it a meritorious act.
Here.
Think again,
I was dragged into this mess by this dude called D.
- What D? - The D as in ABCD.
Remember how he looks?
His face?
Come in.

[REPUBLIC OF KOREA}
[JAPAN]
Have you heard the robbery on K3, May 6th?
What happened?
If I knew your people were on the train,
You have no sense of humor.
My people were robbed.
How funny is that?
Come on!
Vasily, he's a big shot in Moscow!
Mr. Jin from Nanchang.
He dreams of becoming a pilot. Though his dream didn't come true,
he has always wanted to bay a CY-27 fighter jet
as a collectible.
If this deal goes through, the two of us will have a 10% commission, my brother.
Excuse me.
Really? Follow them? Nothing but a couple of thieves.
All I know is that I was terrified.
and hid in the restroom the entire time.
You can also have the car.
I heard the female victim is still in Moscow.
Yes.
Miao Ziwen is no good for you.
- Jealous? - Can't I?
You've had your chance.
The car behind has been following us.
Turn left at the next alley.
We've been spotted.
Hold on tight.
Director Zhuo asked me to tell you
This is yours.
We'll split up.
Bagito Bakery, 28 Barlow Street
The leather-jacket lady might show up there.
Cui!
Sergey!
Here.
Thank you.
Back in the days I was studying abroad at the Minzu College. I lost my wallet on a train.
and I didn't lose a single penny.
The two parties are in a rough fight.
Prices have skyrocketed, and Ruble hits rock bottom.
Now even for a little foreign currency,
these criminals will do anything.
Sergey?
Pasha, good to see you.
And this is Pasha.
We're a debt collecting company.
Let's keep in touch.
However, you sould also be cautious of him, he can betray anyone
Also, I need some police assistance.
We have traveled a long way, and we cannot return empty-handed.
I'll do my best.
It's a mess here.
Thank you.
What?
What are you doing?
What!
Whisker robber that train.
is going to drag us down.
I shouldn't have let you on that train.
I heard the boss and Vasily used to work together.
One is from Beijing, the other Guandong. How did they meet?
I thought you two were close.
Why are you asking me now?
He helped me with my visa to Russia in 1990.
Did you know that the boss started his career with him?
The boss used to run a stall at the Zoo.
He met Vasily when he went to Guandong to source goods
"If you want to make big money, you have to risk high."
the boss came here to find Vasily,
I heard Vasily has a daughter.
Where is she now?
You're the one kooking up with your boss!
I'm sorry.
Hit me, won't you?
Please... I'm sorry. I love you.
I love you so much.
The French cheese you sent is her favourite.
To Hell.
Igor!
A Rolex?
Finally, I can throw away this shitty watch!
Welcome to the Water Palace Casino!
Thanks, baby!
Chips and there.
This is the VIP entrance.
Thr routes spread like a spider's web down there.
This way.
They will open when water accumulates,
The gates will open in a few minutes.
I've heard the profit here is enormous.
All US dollars.
Shipped out monthly.
Towards the middle of each month,
no one is allowed inside, except those with VIP cards.
Yes.
Aren't they afraid of being robbed?
They fear the police more than robbers.
Without their uniform, these cops are worse than the robbers.
- Have you seen this guy? - No.
Take look at this.
Have you met this guy before?
Have you seen this guy?
No.
Who told you that?
You were at the casino that day. What for?
You don't even gamble.
But you were there, too.
Cash from the K3 train plus the sales to items.
That's your share.
This is it?
who jumped off the train alone was more than ten grand.
It's not enough.
I have to split the robbery money with others.
Didn't get to enjoy the spoils and ended up in trouble, right?
Did it ever occur to you that these people could have been cops?
Are you blaming me?
The fortune-telling set showed the worst sign that day.
It's your business if you go solo and mess up. Just don't drag us down.
What makes you think you are one to talk?
You're just a douchebag.
- Get him! - Stop him!
Damn it!
This is Miss Li Fang,
Was he one of them?
Don't move.
They wore masks,
I can't be certain.
Do you remember any other details?
There was this guy,
he was listening to Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony.
I knew all these pieces
Enjoy.

An old comrade of Hans' got this for us.
when we have the money.
Believe it or not. It's your only shot.
Right.
Brothers.
Stronger than kinship.
They were close.
When Vasily got married,
Miao Qingshan was his bestman.
and wanted out to see his newborn daughter,
and his wife took their daughter
away from Guangdong.
Miao Qingshan arranged it in a way
His people took photos or send gift from time to time,
but be won't
Miao Qingshan said
tied to Vasily's soul.
Vasily had no way to contact his daughter.
But,
Vasily definitely did not take part in the train robbery.
Please don't arrest him for that.
Contact the task force.
See if they can locate Liu Yuhu's daughter.
Okay.
Tell me everything you know about the people involved in the robbery.

You're Liu Yuhu, an outlaw.
You've got the wrong person.
the court won't be so harsh on you.
I'm not going back, and I can't go back.
Alright, suit yourself then!
[Passport name: Wen Zhenwei]
The passport may not be yours,
but it's not me.
How do you tell her
along the Russian border.
Yes, I know.
We have testimony from Li Shuzhen.
She is in hospital now.
Captain, he's definitely going to run.
If we don't let him go, for sure Miao Qingshan will run.
- You're just Vasily's bitch. - You chose your boss over me.
So are you Miao Qingshan's bitch.
What happened?
Damn it!
Will Miao Qingshan face the death penalty when he returns to China?
That's up to the judge.
My duty is to capture him and bring him back to China.
I have a daughter.
I know.
I can't believe Vasily actually did it! He came back with a fighter jet,

Do we really need all this fire power?
You pack a lot of heat as well.
It's pretty rough these days.

There's no one here. There are plenty of abandoned places like this.
Is that my money?
Where's my fighter jet?
On its way.
The money is yours.

A miracle?
I believe in miracles.
Because I really love dancing.
Look.
Tell me now.
What are we good at?
That's right.

No.
No, we don't. That's okay.
Then we can do something that has nothing to do with dreams.

We all call him Bro Hua.
He's doing some good deeds outside the campus.
He took out all the people
with the dancing move
We should totally recruit him.
But his only passion is studying.
Help him get better grades.
Then he has to join us in the dancing competition.
Which one of us could help him study then?
Me.
Maybe I am good at math.
It will please you physically and mentally.
Such a healthy way of living.

Here comes the teacher. Gather together.
This is the list of members who are attending Strictly Come Dancing.
Huang.
Come here.
Come here.
Me? Yes.
I'll show you how to do it.
Alright.
When you attend the competition, you'll be facing the judges and audience.
Then what?
Take a deep bow.
Then announce the name of our dance
Then what?
Your whole performance ends here.
What do you expect?
What about...
you take my place?
I thought her dancing moves were quite fine actually.
However, she doesn't really fit in my formation.
Salted fish.
With pink ribbons.
Who is doing this?
Who?
It's not your place here.
Thanks! It really fits you.
Please root for Huang.
Please. Please root for Huang.
Come here. Thanks, uncle.
Your daughter is so popular
Please! Thank you!
My dear daughter!
We've got our own school dance team now.
You...
are joking here, right?
We mean it.
You're the lead in your team.
How could I be the lead?
I think you are qualified.
I can't do it. I'm short and tanned.
We don't have a stellar conduct grade either.
And...
Why are we doing this together after all?
To get laughed at with you? No.
Strictly Come Dancing.
You mean you?
Have you won even once in your life?
That's why I am trying to win for the very first time.
You can't do that.
Hey. Here's what I'm thinking.
We couldn't have won without you.
But now that we've got you, we can win.
Who said anything about me joining you guys?
Because I'm not.
Stop following me.
I'm not giving up.
You have to join us.
I don't buy that any more.
How... How about... I pay you?
How about I pay you 200 yuan a lesson for coaching us?
Now?
Forget it.
I always honor my word.
You are Sammi's daughter after all. Join us!
Let's go to Strictly Come Dancing together!
Join us! For real!
Join us.
Let's go to Strictly Come Dancing together!
My dad told me
especially in rainy days.
Watch your mouth.
Why should I believe that you guys can actually dance?
Dancing is actually pretty easy.
Go with the wind.
Do you know why is there rainbows?
Enlighten me.
Leave some to me!
I'll invite Huang to be our dancing coach.
200 yuan?
No way. It's so expensive to learn to dance.
It's true.
No one can succeed easily.
Use your brain.
She's distinctive in her own way.
She must be poor.
Poor?
Yeah.
She's supporting her family by teaching dance.
So we must help her to tide over her difficulties.
It's a good deed.
Boss.
He's my schoolmate.
200 yuan?
Get lost.
Boss. 5 people.
200 yuan for a whole day.
It means you only need to pay 40 yuan for one person a day.
Whatever. Fine.
and beg for money?
But what about we try to make some money on our own first?
That's right, boss. Otherwise, we'll really become beggars.
Then be beggars.
Let's go. Make money on our own.
Okay.
Just get the ribbons off of the fish.
It really takes time and effort to do that.
It looks so cute.
If you have good taste, just tell me,
what girls in your age like usually?
We don't know ourselves well enough.
Now that's you knowing yourself well enough right there.
Where's our coach?
Hi, coach.
Hi, coach.
But... the missing piece is some real music.
Come on. Let's dance together.
Come on. One.
Three.
Okay, let's do it again.
Pull back.
Spread. Six.
This dance really hurts my eyes.
I can't believe somebody is learning this.
Still some salted fish.
Now all of my fat shakes even more when I am dancing.
We are too fat.
I still need some dignity to hold on to.
Now I...
only have this much left.
What about...
we do something else for a change, and try our best again?
Thanks, boss.
Go.
Now, we've got money.
Can I have those fish to myself?
Thanks. Bye.
We are all trying our best.
That's great.
I'll keep up the great effort too.
As long as I can step foot on stage, I'll catch my mom's eyes.
That's some strong faith.
Oh... right.
Are you serious?
Of course not.
We made money by working at a salted fish store.
Salted fish store again.
from some salted fish stores my whole life?
It's really lousy.
Speaking of which, I've got a present for you.
Your boss?
Maybe our boss looks clumsy and coarse on the outside.
Even a little tacky. But...
he came up with such a cute idea
Isn't that adorable?
You think it's adorable?
What do you say?
How much does he love his daughter
for him to come up with such a funny way
And, one more thing.
He also told us that
his daughter can absolutely dance better
than our coach, which means you.
We got pissed right there.
You can't make biased statement like that.
That's me doodling right there.
I'm changing the package here.
Dad.
The pink ribbon is nice enough.
Others don't like it because...
Because what?
I'm the little sea maid.
You are Sammi's daughter.
The superstar.
Who said that?
You are quite talented at dancing.
That's right.
I've been teaching others dancing recently.
My daughter's a coach now.
That's right.
My daughter's a coach now.
That's impressive.
You can dance so well. Here.
You've been giving me enough pocket money.
You are repaying me with only 200 yuan?
You think 200 yuan is enough to repay me?
Isn't this my money?
That's for sure.
No need to argue that.
Teacher.
Why isn't my name on the list?
I just need one second under the spotlight.
It's OK that you kid around with us.
Don't believe in your own lie.
We've already submitted the list.
She's not even the announcer now.
That's right.
Huang.
takes ten years of practice off stage.
Think about it.
He even tied pink ribbon on the salted fish.
That's really tacky.
Are you OK?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
We are...
the dancing team of Yangguang High School.
We are going to
do a dance routine
Five, six, seven, go.
One. Two. Three.
Two. Three. Four.
Go.
They're all laughing at you!
Go. Go.
We can't watch you getting bullied and do nothing.
We are
the dancing team of Yangguang High School.
You've seen that.
I've been coaching you every day.
But I actually am only an announcer.
That's right.
Coach! You might need to coach us
We are going to Strictly Come Dancing with you.
I'll quit on being an announcer then.
We are going to Strictly Come Dancing together.
Strictly Come Dancing.
We still have open slots for the school dance team.
Please join us, everyone.
Let's shine together.
Light up your life.
Youngster!
Let's dance!
Welcome to join us!
Let's dance!
You don't really know young boys.
Forget about those useless pitch lines.
I only want to emphasize one thing.
We've got a pretty girl in the dancing team.
We've only got limited slots.
What are they doing?
The flexible waist.
braised pork feet,
Dancing is the food that we need.
For the competition this afternoon,
I have to inform you, coach.
I've sprained my ankle.
I broke my fingernails really bad. It's not healed yet.
Goodbye, court.
That's because of the pretty girl.
Step up to dance.
Only for the things you love.
Step up to dance.
Only for the things you love.
Peace and love.
If you want to attend the competition, your ranking must rise by 10 spots.
Do you know light refraction?
No, I don't.
You should know about rainbow after all.
That I know.
It's a lucky charm that can get you pass all the exams, right?
What is rainbow then?
It's the sunshine after heavy rain.
It's the trip a drop of water takes.
The angle between sunshine and the ground equals theta.
Go through the water drop at last.
The direction it goes slightly changes again.
The light deflected 42 degrees
Why are there seven colors in rainbows?
Sunshine has painted the world
in a warm white.
The white consists of
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple.
It's going through the air
and enter the face of water drop.
The direction might be deflected.
You've been discussing for so long.
Newton said
light is particle.
Huygens said light is wave.
Einstein said no no no.
Light is particle,
and light is wave.
Light is not particle,
not particle,
nor the wave.
This is the wave-particle duality of light.
Newton said light is particle.
Huygens said light is wave.
Light brings warm and happiness.
It shines on flowers.
It shines on us.
Every straw,
straw...
Every straw.
Great.
We can call ourselves
"Team Straw In The Breeze",
We dance when we meet the breeze.
Don't have the time to bother.
We are just like straws in the field.
We grow up freely and wildly.
Make a pact
to be happy together
and to grow up together.
Simple and easy.
We've been lectured together.
We've run loops and been punished together.
Who's the monkey king?
It's me.
Who's the little sea maid?
It's me.
Important to one another.
We make a fuss together.
Together
we are straws.
We are all great.
We pick the stars even with muddy hands.
We are together.
Even if we fall,
We are straws.
We are happy silly people.
We are all great.
We are very small but extra strong.
Get ready for the breeze.
Go with it!
What if they cannot pass the exam?
That's alright.
That's right.
Why's that?
Because,
You like me?
You don't like me?
Are you 18 years old and able to talk about adult stuff?
Emm.
You didn't say this just because you're an adult now, did you?
The Ferris wheel is silly.
All it can do is stand right there and wait.
Get my shoulder ready
Make all her dreams come true.
The Ferris wheel is silly.
Turn on the warm light.
Fly with her.
We can go and check ourselves because you can fly.
We can run forward and laugh.
There's light ahead.
We can run forward and laugh.
There's light ahead.
I've passed.
Passed or not?
Somebody said she's Bro Hua's wife.
Because Bro Hua is from some rural area,
We've been married for 5 years.
He was in a special situation.
Silly.
His parents passed away when he was young.
He's the elder brother in the family.
So he set up a stall to sell things when he was young.
What's the deal?
You still don't understand math?
After we got married, our family wasn't as tight on money.
Once he's not illiterate,
he won't be fooled and bullied.
I am telling you, listen to your teacher in class.
in the future dancing competition?
I'm sorry.
My wife has been working her ass off.
And it's not humiliating
to attend the dancing competition with us.
We have a family to support.
I'll just tell you one thing.
That meal we had right there
cost my wife half month of her salary.
I'm sorry.
Good luck with the competition.
Let me pass.
Sammi's there.
Huang. Hurry up, go find your mom.
Go find your mom!
Go!
My dad said
you were my mom.
Be happy, boss.
Then
you happened to see my performance
Your dad said
and she became a super star.
So you know everything.
Are you my mom or not.
You can just
I... I'm just joking.
I was joking the whole time.
I'm here to follow the superstar I love.
It's pretty difficult
to lie to a person for more than a decade.
Every single holiday
it's pretty hard every time.
However,
That's a weird outfit.
It's so ugly.
That's just awful.
Yes, she is. She's been so good to us
and done so much for us.
I suggest
Ol' Dog. Huang is leaving.
Huang.
We still have a long way to go.
I will never dance again.
I'm sorry.
We've been practicing together for so long.
No matter what happened, we have to keep dancing.
Because you really excel at dancing.
Hop in.
We can.
Right? Relax. I got your back.
Sit tight.
Huang.
Out of gas?
You've been driving the festooned vehicle of Strictly Come Dancing around.
Where's the miracles the show pitched?
The super thunderstorm suddenly has formed
and will pass Haikou recently.
We will close all the harbors and terminals immediately.
Bro Dog. Bro Dog.
Don't stop.
Bro Dog, here we come. Dance!
Sorry, Coach Huang.
Goodbye, Coach Huang!
Come home with me. Just to chill.
Uncle San. Auntie San.
Long.
Welcome. Uncle San.
Hello.
Taste good!
Here comes the seafood.
Steamed crab.
Thanks, Auntie San.
We've got one extra dish here.
You are still quite young.
Li, get some of this. It's your favorite.
Young man.
No matter what happened, be happy and have some more.
Here.
Thanks, Uncle San. You're welcome.
Give him some more. This is delicious.
Here. Get some more.
What are we doing here?
Since when do we need to put digesting down in our calendar?
peacefully and quietly.
That's right.
It's different for you.
You can watch the final.
No.
It's pretty good.
If you don't know,
how should we know?
Yeah.
Young man.
Long told me that
Why made such a fuss about one breakup?
When I broke up with somebody,
I didn't get sulky.
He taught me how to dance.
That's how I wooed your auntie San.
That's neat.
We had nothing like what you have today.
You have everything now.
You can dance every day.
If only I could have what you have now,
I should be
Really?
Why should I lie to you?
Let me tell you.
When you dad was young,
As soon as you learn this dance,
She always only left me her phone number
You mentioned about the past like it's a legend.
We care about her so much
We never will get the answer that we want.
What exactly does she think?
You mentioned about the past like it's a legend.
So, my family signed me up for a tutoring school.
I'm going back.
Alright.
However, it might not be possible
Our grades are too bad.
We couldn't get in those universities.
Bro Dog.
I'll miss you.
I didn't even like dancing before.
Me neither.
Me neither.
Me neither.
But now,
Have you ever thought about
And why was he dancing after all?
How should I know?
Have you ever thought about
And why was he started dancing?
That's right. What?
You knew?
The other day in my store,
asked me the same question.
But I could've guessed.
In ancient times,
our ancestors went back home after a tired long day.
They lived in caves.
It was really dark.
Somebody set up a bonfire.
Everyone circled the bonfire.
Then,
it was a night like tonight.
In the night breeze,
under the shining stars,
They kept each other warm.
They feared the darkness no more.
After all...
After all,
human being is quite fragile.
Dad.
Who is my mom?
Your mom
You...
Mom.
Strictly come dancing,
and you are the miracle.
and who have come to our final of Strictly Come Dancing.
Welcome!
Our final is going live today.
It's really special.
Because we are at
the wind turbine platform
in South China Sea.
Youngsters are breeze.
It generates power for youth.
Dance move is breeze.
It generates power for dream.
Which team will win
the championship of Strictly Come Dancing?
Dear audience,
every team that made to our final
is in position now.
Let's dance.
Miracle makers!
Dear passengers, please board the ship with your ticket.
Dear passengers, please board the ship with your ticket.
Young girl.
Young girl! Young girl1 Hello, young girl.
Will you be watching our final today?
Have you thought about dancing yourself? Coach!
I've got my own dancing team.
We lost in the preliminary competition. We were out.
You still have some regrets
Of course there are regrets.
Of course. Every person tries their best
Isn't there more to life than winning?
Like what?
Like losing in a happier way.
Thanks!
Look at Huang!
I really do have regrets.
We are going to graduate soon,
and going parted ways.
One of my regrets is that nobody will ever say
"we'll do something big together" blatantly.
One of my friends once said
We can lose in a happier way.
dancing together.
Those underdogs,
those students with poor grades,
Don't they deserve to shine?
We can just be happy salted fish.
It's pretty hot outside.
It's really bright.
We can be bright and hot together.
After this dance,
Mom. I've got to go.
Go. Let's go.
Let's help her.
Hurry!
Here we go!
Hurry!
Wait for me.
Go!
Go!
Come on. A winner never needs to make a long speech.
She's not talking to you.
She's talking to you then?
That's right.
I'm her first love.
That's quite straight forward.
Where's my auntie?
Auntie!
Hey girl. The competition is over.
What are you doing here? Hurry up.
Go!
Straw In The Breeze,
we are never defeated!
Straw In The Breeze,
we are never defeated!
Straw In The Breeze,
we are never defeated!
It turns out
there really is seven-colored cloud here.
Run through the summer
We are invincible, right?
What is rainbow?
The light traveling to you
Will all our silliness and dream come true?
Shall we go and save the world?
We are straws
We come from dirt
Let's go
Silly kids
Sky
And sea
Will it disappear?
After becoming an adult?
No matter where you are
We are straws
We come from dirt
Let's go
Wild kids
Run away
Open your arms
Go against the breeze
Let's fly
Will you miss me?
I'll miss you!
Nawal, where are you?
We already tried yesterday.
Maybe it worked yesterday?
Please, Nawal, let me sleep. I'm exhausted.
We'll try again tomorrow.
Adnan!
Nora.
Are you awake?
Yes!
Hurry up and get dressed!
Adnan.
Wake your dad up.
Dad,
you promised to take me to the mall.
Come on, now. Mom will get pissed.
Adnan, what's wrong?
Adnan.
When a woman loses her husband, she actually loses her lover, partner,
Amen.
The light of this house is extinguished and it is draped in darkness.
Dear God, give him a better home than this home,
Sister Nawal, dear sisters,
a widow is obliged before God,
to safeguard her husband's reputation and honor.
But if you have duties or responsibilities,
then you may leave the house to do them.
After the wake is over.
She stays with Feryal after school, as usual.
Bring her over whenever you want, I'm available.
Thank you, dear. I know you're always there.
My sweetheart.
These are the pajamas Adnan had on.
You are strong and pious.
This is God's will, right?
Hello Rifqi, come in.
They will eat later.
Come in, please, come in.
No.
Is everyone coming tomorrow?
Yes.
Will Dad be upset if I missed school?
No.
Finish your dinner.
Did Dad die or pass away?
Dying and passing away are the same thing.
Why?
Because he got tired.
Nora!
Wake up, we're late!
I'm up.
Are you done? Get ready!
One minute.
I'm ready.
Alright.
Well done for getting ready quickly.
Tie up your laces.
How did Dad teach you?
Don't move.
Watch how I tie it.
Here's the pick-up.
<i>of water scarcity in Jordan.</i>
<i>which is an issue that neither previous nor current government were able to...</i>
May he rest in peace, dear.
My heartfelt condolences.
Thank you.
You have to be strong.
If you need anything, we're here for you.
I was worried that you'd ask for more days off.
It's been three days and she won't let anyone bathe her but you.
How are you, gorgeous?
What's up, dear?
Did you miss me?
How are you, Nawal?
Thank you.
I wanted to call you,
but I felt it might be inappropriate.
No worries.
How are you, gorgeous?
If you need anything, I'm here for you, you know that.
Enough with your shy attitude, I'm serious.
We've known each other for over four years now.
I told you a million times, even if your dad and I approve,
the church will not approve, They need a compelling reason.
Not now for God's sake.
All men like to play around.
Even Bill Clinton cheated on his wife!
What did she do? Nothing.
And there she is, a respectable lady appreciated by everyone.
Just for your sake and to keep this family intact.
This isn't a compelling reason for the priest?
You need witnesses, smartass!
What better proof do you want, Mom?
What's so funny?
It's legal here.
This way, I wouldn't have displeased the church or caused you a scandal.
Forget about her food for now.
There's a key to every man.
Am I married to a human or a lock?
Why make it difficult? He's a player, with or without a key.
That God will guide him? And what if God doesn't guide him?
I'd never live like my mom,
It's better than spending the rest of your life alone.
Oh, I wish I was the bag!
My love.
You're late.
Your brother tried calling you several times.
He said you're not picking up.
Ok, I'll call him now.
- Thanks, Feryal. - Take care.
I can't hear you.
No, don't worry, all is well.
<i>Rifqi called me, he wants to come by to check on you and Nora.</i>
Okay, we're home, you're welcome to come.
<i>Okay, I will call him now. Bye.</i>
Okay. Bye.
I want to watch cartoons.
What was that noise?
No, no, don't get close!
Get out, hurry!
Hold on, hold on.
- How are you, Nora? - Fine.
- Come in, Rifqi. - Hello.
- Good evening. - Good evening.
How are you?
Such a good girl,
Look what I got you.
That's right.
Come in.
How are you today, Nawal? Better, I hope?
- Thank God, I'm fine. - Thank God.
If you need anything, I'm here.
consider it my responsibility.
Thank you, Rifqi.
We're all family and we will all help.
Yes,
let's recite the Quran every Monday.
This came as a shock.
Coffee.
No. Who told you that?
Go sit over there.
Adnan told me, because there are 4 instalments...
What instalments?
Regarding the pick-up...
Adnan still owes me 4 instalments.
He never mentioned it.
but I'm in a financially tight situation
No, I didn't mean,
but...
why weren't his employers paying him?
He never mentioned it.
Don't worry about it.
I'll find a buyer for the pick-up soon, we'll sell it,
I'll take my payments, and distribute the rest among the inheritors.
Don't worry, I'll manage.
You don't know how to drive.
Anyways, everything will be clear after the inheritance paperwork.
Just the apartment and the pick-up.
You're his brother, the closest person to him...
was from my inheritance, from my late father,
The monthly instalments were settled from both our salaries.
Of course, sister,
Then why isn't the apartment in your name?
Because the mortgage was made against his employment contract.
Can I see the agreement Adnan's lawyer did?
And please get the family record book.
Ok.
Adnan swore that he did it and signed it.
Just like that, you'll sign it and solve the problem?
This whole document is useless without the official stamps!
What should I do now?
Hurry up, Nora.
Yes, Mrs. Souad.
I'm on my way.
Nawal.
Ok, sure.
The traffic in Amman is becoming unbearable!
Come on, move!
Ahmad told me about the agreement.
In regard to what?
The pick-up instalments.
Our esteemed lady, Colette,
The efforts, sacrifices and love that you have given us…
I'm a week late.
Do you think I'm pregnant?
Have you tested?
No.
I'm not ready.
Maybe that's the solution?
I don't even feel I have a maternal instinct,
or the desire to give birth.
No one is born with this feeling,
it grows on you after you have a child.
Because I liked him,
and wants to have sex with him,
the only solution is to marry him.
And getting married, means having children.
So, in order to have sex, you should get stuck in this vortex,
Lauren!
It makes a loud explosion!
SpongeBob...
he wished he could drive.
Why's the place such a mess?
Hello!
I took the keys from Feryal.
I've been calling you all morning, why aren't you answering?
Then go tell him that.
- Welcome, Rifqi. - Hi, Nawal.
Uncle wants to kill the mouse.
But we clean the apartment every day.
Your uncle doesn't mean that our home is dirty.
If Adnan was alive, he would have saved me from this rut.
This is why I suggested selling the pick-up.
Ok, as you wish.
The pick-up issue is clear now.
I'll sort it out and pay you back.
I finalized the inheritance document today.
my sisters and I inherit half the apartment
I found the agreement, but Adnan forgot to sign.
That means there is no contract.
I'm not lying to you!
Besides, how would you like me to divide the apartment?
Calm down,
I'm just trying to explain the situation to you.
This is our right, and this is how things work.
I suggest selling the apartment, you settle the instalments,
and we then distribute the shares.
What if I had a boy?
Nawal, please, no need for this attitude.
We all have our problems, and we all want them resolved.
If you have another solution, please spit it out!
we have nowhere else to live!
Where will we go?
My dear sister-in-law, I'm still here for you.
Listen up,
- Calm down, calm down. - Sit properly!
Calm down, we're family.
We'll definitely find a solution.
I could easily leave the house that I am renting
and move here with my wife and children.
Turn off the TV!
Mom,
When I was a child, I feared nothing.
Because everyone is afraid of them.
But they're small and harmless.
And they carry diseases and they're disgusting,
and stop blabbering.
Come on, sleep.
Can you unlock this phone?
Yes, why?
Did you forget the password?
Yes.
The number is registered under your name?
No, my husband's.
What do you mean? I stole it?
Second, I don't need trouble.
Alright. Your first excuse was sufficient, thanks.
You're welcome.
May Adnan rest in peace.
Thank you.
I'm here to ask about Adnan's last salary and social security.
Adnan left us over 4 months ago.
We don't owe him anything!
Four months?
Actually, ma'am, he left on bad terms,
and since then, we lost contact.
With all honesty, he was tired lately and had health issues.
We can raise some funds. I can ask his colleagues to contribute.
No, no need,
I just want his social security and tax documents.
Why are you staring at me like this and leaving Aunt Colette alone?
Are you drinking cinnamon?
Since we live in the Middle Ages in this country,
abortion pills are forbidden.
So, it's confirmed?
Why should your baby pay the price?
I don't want a baby that resembles him.
Nawal.
Nawal!
That's not possible.
and you don't answer my messages.
- I'm his wife. - Can you please sign here?
What's that?
Thank you.
What a shame!
Did you inherit any cash?
Fine.
Fine.
I'll tell the judge that he's throwing us on the streets!
Keep the door shut!
No, no...
No, I won't argue with anyone.
I won't argue with anyone.
I'll just calmly tell him what happened.
Bye!
He wants to sell the apartment to get cash.
Can you afford to rent?
so we won't disturb Mr. Mouse.
Here.
- No, thanks. - Come on.
Thank you.
Thanks for that.
You're a widow with a daughter,
No one can talk some sense into Rifqi?
Finish your sandwich, Nora.
When is the court hearing?
Tomorrow.
He's definitely in a hurry.
Have faith in God.
He will guide you.
and hopefully God will send you a sign of relief.
Um Nora!
I'm not the only late one!
Trust in God.
You can live with me until I find you a decent husband.
- Good morning. - Good morning, Rifqi.
Good morning, Um Nora.
The assets are clear.
Anyone has more information they would like to add?
and you still have 4 instalments to pay.
Or debts I missed mentioning?
If not, then this should be fairly straightforward.
In fact, Your Honor...
my husband borrowed from me my inheritance
and my gold dowry,
which we used as the down payment for the apartment.
No, I don't.
that the deceased borrowed money from his wife?
He used to manage his affairs by himself.
In other words, they are responsible before God and the public
for taking care of the wife and her children.
What responsibility, Your Honor?
He wants to sell our home to cash out his share!
But he is obliged to support your daughter,
Your Honor, can we talk in private?
Go ahead.
Sir, I'm pregnant.
Anyway, this is the jurisdiction of the Sharia court.
Take a pregnancy test and show them the result
Please call back Rifqi Khalaf, case number 47.
who passed away on 21 February, 2019,
(1) An apartment worth 30,000 Jordanian dinars.
owed to his brother, Rifqi Mansour Khalaf.
we have decided to postpone the request for distribution of the inheritance
Yes, true.
but your responsibilities increased since my late brother died.
Certainly,
but everyone should mind their own business.
and her mother doesn't pick up the phone.
Nawal, I'm not here to make trouble.
Nora is always welcome at my place!
We also have rights, too, just like you.
Why should my sisters be deprived of their brother's inheritance?
But they're both married and have their houses!
and inshallah you will give birth to a boy.
- Two or 3 more months! - No, I can't wait that long!
Did you even ask yourself who paid for the burial and wake?
I'm okay.
Listen...
What is it?
Trust in God, the child comes and his sustenance comes with him.
Eventually in 2 or 3 months,
it will be obvious.
I can’t help you,
this will get us both in trouble.
Hello, honey.
Come in.
I wish you'd brought more meat.
Not at all,
no trouble at all.
What's wrong with her visiting her uncle?
Nawal, for God's sake, give me a break from all this.
Come on, go to your room, get going.
Come on, clear this room.
No grumbling!
Don't bother, I'm leaving.
Go on, get up...
to sell our home, he'll take her for good!
In a couple of days.
Alright.
- You won't get much for it. - I don't care.
I'll sort out the remaining instalments later.
Come in.
Nawal, I'm glad you arrived.

<i>HOW TO FORGE A PREGNANCY TEST</i>
Uncle Rifqi told me I'm going to have a brother.
Get inside.
We don't know yet.
But look,
until then, we won't tell anyone.
It's our secret, deal?
Why are you watching TV now?
I want to play after dinner!
Can we go to McDonald's?
It's late already and I can't drive the car.
I promise you we'll go next week.
Besides, I can't enter the kitchen alone.
Excuse me, Mrs. Souad.
I'm so embarrassed to ask, but...
I have lots of commitments and I need an advanced payment.
If possible.
Why do you need it?
Ok, dear, I'll talk to Lauren's father when he returns.
but the salary is his responsibility.
Ok, thanks.
Nawal.
When will you reply to my messages?
Or should I give up?
You're out of charge.
Nothing.
Aren't we friends?
Don't worry.
Besides, we're colleagues, not friends.
I thought we were more than that.
I know what you're going through isn't easy,
that's why I keep checking on you.
I don't want anything from you.
It's just that...
You can tell me.
Everything is new to me.
My entire life is in turmoil, everything is new to me.
A new problem pops up every day and I must handle it,
For example, Adnan's pick-up is blocking the building's foyer,
I can park it for you.
Thanks, you're so kind.
Do you need anything?
Are you okay?
I need your help...
What favor?
under my name?
What for?
I need to be pregnant,
otherwise, Adnan's family will confiscate the apartment.
Nora and I will be homeless.
and I got a sign that I'm pregnant.
By the way, if you download any app,
There's no way I'd do that.
I mean...
lying is a sin...
sex is a sin...
but every sin has a motive and a justification.
I think that making you and your daughter homeless is the sin,
I'll help you,
but I need your help, too.
I need you to find a doctor to give me an abortion,
Ok.
You can always say you miscarried.
I just need a positive test.
Oh, I wish I was the purse!
Mom!
What's this?
- Get your stuff, quick. - Hi, honey!
How are you, Feryal?
Nora told me you're pregnant,
but I didn't tell anyone, by the Quran, no one
Indeed.
Your brother passed by and dropped off empty boxes.
What are these boxes for?
Are you moving out?
You didn't answer me.
Are you selling his clothes?
Stop it!
Super Nora!
Remove this damn thing!
Show me! Who taught you this silly game?
All young girls play it. It encourages them to like the hijab.
Calm down, you shouldn't stress, it's bad for the baby.
Were you this nervous when pregnant with Nora?
I was shit! Leave me the fuck alone!
Show me.
Does it hurt here?
It's ok.

Come in.
Abla, right?
- Yes. - Can you please shut the door?
Lock it.
Abla, you need to sign this paper
using your real name and national number.
in case something goes wrong.
As agreed with the woman over the phone it's 1,500 dinars to be paid in advance.
Okay?
Fine.
Doctor,
why won't you operate if there's a pulse?
Thank you, Nawal.
Take care of yourself.
If you need anything, just call me.
Take this.
Take it, buy something for Nora.
We are all in the same shit.
Your Honor, she recently discovered her pregnancy
Why was the test taken at a private lab?
But no one told me...
Why didn't you inform the court about the
- No one told me. - I wasn't sure back then.
What debt are you talking about?
Four pick-up instalments that she refuses to pay!
I didn't refuse. Your Honor, this was a debt between him and his brother.
Answer the question!
I'm answering, don't interrupt me!
He has nothing to do with it!
I want you to answer the question, when will you pay me?
You have 2 options:
- You can either pay him... - How will she pay, sir?
Her salary is barely sufficient, and she works until midnight,
which means she can't take a second job!
You're not giving me a chance to breathe!
Since Adnan passed away and you...
Quiet!
Give her a week,
if she doesn't pay, then you sell the pick-up and close the debt,
and the rest of the money will go
Let's go do the damn test and be done with it.
Ok.
Here's 200 as agreed.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

Madam is sleeping.

Where's Lauren?

Ok, calm down.
Finally, a smile. You worried me over the phone.

Gently.
At the same time, gently.
Or reverse...
Yes, reverse. Gently, gently.
I need a favor.
I need some money.
500 dinars.
Souad asked me to find a new nurse.
I never imagined it's that long.
Nawal...
I want more than that...
I want a life with you.
I love you.
I'll get out here.
I'll get you the money tomorrow.
<i>RIFQI KHALAF</i>
Nora!
I'm telling you Rifqi took Nora.
A colleague who works at Souad's. I was tired, so he drove me home.
I can't take this anymore, there's a new problem every day!
At this rate, you're going to lose everything.
- It's all my fault. - Yes, it's your fault!
The man has responsibilities, many ends to meet.
It's not his problem that your husband was fired.
Just sell the damn pick-up and pay him back!
I sold my bedroom furniture to pay him!
- I'm going to the police. - That's all we need. Listen to me!
Listen to me! You will stay here tonight

Honey, sweetheart...
What's wrong? Why are you crying?
I'm fine, honey, I'm fine.
I promise.
Bye, honey.
Who did this to her?
Get out.
Out!
Who gave you permission to go in and see her?
Who did that to her?
It's none of your business!
Did you stand by and watch silently?
Better than spending six months in prison after what you two did.
Did you think this would go by so smoothly?
My stupid daughter
thinks that she's a superwoman
who can say and do whatever pleases.
It's your fault.
You did this to her.
I did this to her?
Get out.
Give me my money.
She's waking up!
- You're fine. - You're fine.
Are you ok?
Are you Um Nora?
Yes.
Here.
I'm not signing.
Sister, you must sign it.
I'm not signing!
demanding custody of your daughter from your late husband,
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but what did I do wrong?
Being out from morning to evening renders you unfit to raise the child.
But I go to work, Your Honor.
because we needed my salary to pay the bills.
- Where do you work? - In a house in Amman.
Does it mean you leave the house to provide for your family?
Of course!
My neighbor, an old lady. I pay her a monthly salary
and my daughter spends 3 hours after school at her place.
No. Besides, Your Honor, is it ok that he picks her up from school
and keeps her at his place for two days without informing me, her mother?
and until now, he didn't return her!
and reminds me of my late brother, spends time with her family?
Frankly, Your Honor, I'm worried about her mother's behavior.
and still hasn't done the test requested by court.
First, the pregnancy issue is not within this jurisdiction.
Her mother is still the legal guardian
and you have no right to take the girl without informing her.
Also, your reasons for claiming custody are weak.
Sister, you need to pay attention to your behavior,
What's wrong with you now? You won today.
What does he want?
No! We will do it now and get done with it! Move!
How long before the test results are out?
- What test? - Pregnancy test.
- Let's wait! - I'm going home!
I'm not your sister.
Nora!
Sweetheart. I am here.
Let me see your face.
Say bye to your cousins before we leave.
Did Rifqi leave the pick-up promissory notes?
Wait.
Give me your bag.
You're not answering my calls.
Here's the money you requested.
I'm sorry, Hassan.
Nora!
I wasn't late, see?
Wait here, honey.
You are so rude!
Run!
Where's your mom?
Here's the test result.
Rifqi can't do anything for the coming 9 months.
But until you give birth, you remain in mourning and return home early.
Eh?
It's following us.
Good morning, tickets please.
Sir?
Sir?
Were you dreaming?
May I see your ticket, please?
What a strange ticket...
Ask him...
Excuse me. May I...
Where are you from?
Somewhere far away?
- Yes, sort of. - And where's that?
It doesn't matter.
You're local.
Yes.
You look like...
like some paintings...
ancient ones...
Your profile.
- Mine? - Yes.
Yes, perhaps...
maybe you've seen them.
A big nose?
So you're a scientist?
No, no, I'm...
Jeez, it really stinks in here!
When did you last change your socks, mate?
Because you need some new socks You really stink!
Buy some perfume to soothe your delicate nostrils.
- He's smoking to hide the smell. - That's enough.
Not even jail smelled this bad.
Enough! What the fuck!
Take it easy.
Be careful, this guy's dangerous.
You know what? I'll gift you some socks... Here.
Skinflint.
There's a six-foot criminal on the train, folks!
Come on, sock him in the face...
Buy my socks!
Socks, perfumes, aftershave!
- What can you see? - People.
THE CHIMERA
Arthur!
Arthur!
Come on, jump in.
Eh?
Fuck that!
Come on, Arthur!
Don't be stupid!
Please wait, listen...
We honestly didn't notice you'd fallen behind.
Don't waste your saliva.
"Don't waste your saliva"? I taught you that expression.
Take me home.
No one.
Well then?
Short hair, so pale. What happened?
I'll take Arthur home,
Not even a toast after all this time?
- No, thanks. - Then we'll come with you.
Mario, fetch a bottle.
What the fuck!
I did try...
Here, chicky chicky...
Sorry.
- Arthur? - Yes.
Yes, I'm looking for signora Flora.
I know. You're all she ever talks about.
Arthur this, Arthur that...
I reckon so.
Right now?
Yes, of course.
Ma'am.
He's here.
At last!
My friend.
My dear friend, my only friend.
Take me in there.
What a catastrophe!
This leg works, I can move this one.
But not this one, hence the wheelchair.
It's comfortable.
This is Beniamina's boyfriend.
Beniamina...
Yes, but...
Yes, of course.
That was quick!
It's cold!
No, make some fresh coffee.
It's fine. Thanks.
He's so polite. You're so sweet.
No, bring some wood in, physical exercise helps.
Tone deaf. She's completely tone deaf.
Poor thing...
- Hi, Grandma. - My little flower.
- Good morning, Mum. - Look who's here!
Arthur's back.
Arthur, your eyes are glassy.
You're dressed too lightly.
Let's look in Dad's room.
Trousers, sweaters. I'll put some together.
He can't wear a dead man's clothes.
Do you remember... What's it called?
Okay.
Thank you, Italia.
Eat up.
Who's this? The new student?
- Call that lunch? - Expect her to make roast beef?
- That's overcooked and bland. - No! It looks delicious!
Arthur, we've found you a job.
A proper job.
At a builders' warehouse.
No more living on Mum's shoulders.
No, thanks.
And to think Beniamina loved you, how could she...
She still loves him!
You never allowed us to.
Mum's clever at finding maids without having to pay. She's manipulative.
Okay, let's end it here. We'll never agree.
That's enough! Enough!
- What? - I can hear a baby crying.
Here.
For the fever.
Take your temperature.
Nice.
Just old stuff.
Eh?
Things many "hyes" have seen.
Eyes.
Not hyes, eyes.
Thanks.
You?
There were lots of trees where I was born too.
Andiroba trees...
Jacaranda trees...
See?
No.
No, no, no!
What's this?
Fuck!
Arthur?
Your beloved pots.
We couldn't leave them
with the police rummaging around after you got arrested.
They wanted to nail you and increase your sentence.
why don't we find something to put with them?
- Now we're back together again... - No, thanks!
Get out of here.
Move it!
There's a lot down there.
For sure!
Arthur...
The witches are coming!
Happy Epiphany!
He's stone drunk.
You look so beautiful!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Just one.
Don't hide!
Just one photo!
Okay.
No!
Please!
- Have we met? - No.
and him. the Englishman.
Me?
I'm Spartaco's friend.
- Ah, you're Spartaco's friend? - Yes.
We would recommend him, but he doesn't look at girls anymore,
he only thinks of the one who's gone.
You see?
Hold it there!
Come on!
Mister...
Mister...
I want to show you something big.
Filled with stuff.
My granddad said, "Before you marry a woman, take her to pee on the sand.
But if she drips here and there..."
That's why you never married.
But maybe she's the right girl, eh?
If you say so.
Thanks, Pirro.
Maybe we can sell her something, she's rich.
Careful does it.
There you are. Careful.
Now spin around.
I find the Etruscans so fascinating, so "bohemian",
Pirro!
As my aunt says...
wouldn't be all this machismo in Italy
Well done, excellent observation!
I'm late.
- Over there? - Yes.
It's under here. A treasure!
It's full of stuff!
But remember what we agreed.
No tricks now.
There's nothing here, Katir.
Vases, a spear! Even a statue!
Mister...
Okay.
You've got some
Hold your horses.
My turn now.
Pirro, me too?
Coming up.
Well?
What was in this? He's sick.
Only fernet.
- Only fernet? - We all drank some.
- I feel sick! - He's sick.
- I feel sick... - I feel sick too.
He's faking it.
He's sick because the rod found something.
- I want to dig too. - Shut up.
- You promised. - We promised you?
- Not on my own. - Why not?
Why not?
And follow you home!
Here?
No, that was the wrong note. Listen.
Okay, let's start.
I'd like to explain to you, O God
Italia? There's a leak here too. Bring a bowl.
Oh darn this rain!
What a disaster!
You're flat.
Your character's asking to speak to God, to explain her feelings.
Right note, perfect crease.
Are you listening?
Italia...
What a scatterbrain!
Carry on ironing.
- All right, ma'am. - Discipline.
I'd like to explain to you, O God
It's not "what".
It's who.
Colombina, come here.
Come here!
Take your brother.
Don't cry.
Go on!
An iron rod?
A long one?
It looked dangerous.
Italia?
Italia?
Yes, ma'am.
Rock.
More rock.
Guys, there's a passage.
But someone's already been here.
The stone's smashed!
How horrible!
Not even a ring...
There's loads of stuff.
Melodie?
There's a lekythos.
Look at this!
Red figure.
Lovely.
Grab everything!
Those who work hard come off worse, they travel on foot, never by horse.
Let's toast, let's toast, let's toast!
Katir's here.
Phonies!
You phonies!
You're celebrating with the profits from my stuff!
Get lost!
Even the pigs would spit you out!
Now for the first tercet.
There's this stranger, charming and tall.
From Ireland, or was it England?
And thanks to his dowsing skills and all
In love with archaeology was he
but he never married it and now he deals in contraband.
Whatever the ground offers up when they dig
They've a connection with the underground
Others are just victims
Not everyone is capable of defying
the law, the darkness and the souls of the dead.
Some people are scared of dying
Nights on the lookout when danger is rife
It's a thrilling and risky life,
it's the dream of redemption and wealth.
What's the point of judging then,
Ah, a drop in the ocean...
Photograph.
Wait.
- Yes, yes, temple. - Nice... nice.
Bye Bye.

- Okay, yes. - We're nearly there.
I yearned to see this place again.
to pick up my daughters back from a trip...
RI-PAR-BEL-LA.
I encouraged my daughters to travel. It's important to travel...
I couldn't hold Beniamina back...
she'd jump on any train. She's really curious...
Stop nitpicking...
Good morning. We brought the puppies.
Just a minute, please.
The Englishman's here.
Yes, he's here.
- Is that a puppy? - Yes.
- Can I have a look? - Better not.
It's sick.
Mr Harrison, what a surprise! Welcome back.
Please come in.
- How many pieces? - 18.
18.
He's weighing them up.
Listen, keep my share. I don't want any debts.
Only his share though.
What?
Very rare!
Spartaco says they're just everyday objects.
- Tombs of poor folk. - What?
- They weren't all pharaohs! - It's absurd.
Received.
He'll take it all.
The payment.
Check if they've expired.
This shovel?
To plant beans, officer.
Maybe that's why they didn't sprout, Melchiorre.
Especially him, the Englishman.
Got that?
- Your papers. - Thanks.
Sorry
May I? Thanks.
- This? - Yes.
No, this is mine...
A "troparic" phallus.
Yes, I've seen them.
Mario?
- This is yours. - Thanks.
- I'm 50, 000 liras short. - Count it again.
Jerry and I got less than Mario.
It's horrible.
It's my round tonight.

I wanted to show them your home
Hi.
She's like a broomstick!
All these people.

You put the ice in first.
Who taught you to mix drinks? You're an idiot!
Thanks.
Great! Long live Italia. Let's toast!
I'll take this.
I want to sing too!
- CanI sing? - Is he going?
What's Katir doing?
Go on, Katir!
Go on, Katir!
Come on, Katir!
Thanks.
Cool, Katir!
Hooray for the power station!
Get 'em off!
Come here.

Such assholes!
Arthur.
Come on!
It's disgusting!
Guys, look what I've found.
The Euphronios Krater!
Fabiana, this is electrifying water!
It improves your looks
- Have a swim. - Grab Pirro.
No, grab Mario.
You're a witch.
Cemetery? In what way?
In what way...
See those holes... That one, and that one, they're tombs.
Well done.
Yeah, you're scared.
Long-live-ltalia is scared of tombs.
The maestro has felt something! Watch out!
- How we make our money? - No.
Go and get the tools.
We open tombs.
Tonight of all nights
Well?
Hold it... hold it!
Let them concentrate, they might find something.
Something?
The grave goods.
- What? - The stuff they left the dead.
They believed they helped to save their souls, right?
The souls...
Arthur...
Let me see... it's possible.
A child's grave.
Fabiana, help me stop them.
- Please! - No, leave them to it.
Those things aren't made for human eyes...
Go away!
- Fabiana, help me. - Be quiet!
- We have to call the police. - What?
What about Beniamina?
He didn't tell you Beniamina's dead?
Just great!
Go home.
- Let's go. - That's how it's done.
- Get rid of the broomstick. - Get lost!
I curse you!
Are you listening? What a nerve...
Go on.
Go on...
Mario!
Let me see.
Feckin'hell, it's untouched!
It's still sealed.
Wait!
Give me the torch.
Mario, pass me your lighter.
Oh God!
- Some animals. - Jeez!
How sweet...
There's some water.
It's covered in paintings.
This is beautiful.
Oh, God!
Never mind the souls...
The Etruscans left these here for us.
It's a gift to us!
Mario... It's a goddess.
This is not some funeral stuff.
It's a shrine.
A temple.
This will make us all rich.
- Ready? - Once sharp blow.
One sharp blow.
Perfect.
Pass it to me.
Jerry, let's section it here.
What?
- What the fuck! - Calm down.
We've done it before. We'll take it out in pieces.
Take it easy.
Fuck...
We have to run.
She really did call the cops.
We outnumber them.
Fuck, they'll nab us.
- Hey, calm down. - Two officers.
- Two of them... - Two what?
Two cars.
How many men?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Have they upped the police budget?
Come on.
- Come on, guys! - Drop everything.
You liked jail then?
Arthur, Arthur!
Let's go, Arthur!
There they are!
Do something!
There's another one!
There, look!
Suckers!
- Arthur! - Come on.
- That's all we needed! - Bring him here.
Darn it!
Why?
- Thank goodness they're not. - Damn it! We'd struck it rich.
"Police"
Rospo, bring me that rope.
Thanks.
- What's wrong? - It's Arthur.
It's Arthur.
- She found the kids. - Italia. the witch!
- I never liked her. - I heard the baby crying.
Know what Mum found out? She wasn't hiding one child...
She took Mum's thermos flask.
It must have been awful to find those children there.
You were children once too.
Poor kids, she hid them under her bed.
How do you feel now?
Old.
It's this house, Mum.
You'll see, Mum, we've found this beautiful nursing home.
They'll look after you.
A big garden, lots of flowers, you'll meet new friends...
Can I have this? You don't use it.
- Spartaco. - There's no one here. We're closing.
Open the door, it's important.
I'll talk to him, I'll smash this phone if he doesn't answer.
- Pirro! - Melodie?
Where's Spartaco?
Do you need anything?
Can I help you?
Please...
The back, please.
Details
Please.
Excuse me, look who's here.
Documents.
Documents, please.
The documents!
But, it's important.
Listen, Spartaco...
Finally you can see my face.
Wait!
Here.
Aunt...
Quick.
but you'll never change from what you are.
What's she saying?
That's what we've come for, the statue.
It's ours and...
Nonsense:
- And we have the noddle. - The what?
The head. We found the statue. And we have the head.
- Are you blackmailing me? - Yes, we are.
Or we'll walk in there and tell your friends where you get your finds.
Show me this head. Let's see if it's worth anything.
- Price first. - Head first.
- Money first... - Head first.
Price first!
- What? - It's real.
It's real, we found it.
The price.
Arthur, my dear...
show me this head.
You're not made for human eyes.
Arthur...
It looks interesting.
What the fuck?
Excuse me...
Keep it. You might need it.
While you're here...
You don't know what happened to my goods?
Your what?
My grave goods.
There was a painted askos,
there was also a golden fibula, it was pinned here.
But l...
I don't understand.
Forgive me.
While you're here, we have a question.
There was a kylix with eyes on it, the big ones for drinking...
- What was painted on it? - A fawn running.
Whereas they'd left me a little bell with a little bird on it.
Buddy... buddy.
Wait a sec, please. I need to ask you something.
Thanks, may I?
Something that was mine but I can't find it...
if they didn't crave treasure shining bright,
they'd live in better harmony between bliss and the arcane.
Not alienated from the sacred and the profane,
by the anxiety of profit which only adds to the strain.
rebellion raged in the stranger with his nerves of steel.
All he longed for was a fuller life,
his heart nourished by a richer source
but he remained on the ground with all his old ills.
He decided to come back after wandering around
Melchiorre...
Mister, mister...
Come here, I'm talking to you.
- Well? - Look at the state you're in.
- Come and eat with us. - Yes, come on.
They're fucking thick!
- A nice place. - Okay?
When?
Hey!
If you want to see Mum, clean yourself up.
That's an order.
This one?
Eh2
Yes.
- A bit shorter. - Shorter?
- Is that better? - Much better.
This un?
This one!
It's changed a bit.
Hi.
Hey, who are you?
Hello.
May I?
May I?
where you were.
It's not done.
He followed me here.
You found us.
Or it belonged to everyone.
It's only a temporary setup.
Life itself is temporary.
- Fabiana? - Yes.
She lives here too.
Look who's here!
H
Who'll give me a hand to empty the car?
- Let's unload the car. - Did you get everything?
Hope we have some crisps and popcorn.
Just popcorn, if you're good when I put the treatment on.
Come here, I'll put the concoction on you.
- No, Fabiana. - You'll have lice too.
I'd had enough of them too.
Excuse me.
I was thinking.
Maybe Arthur could stay here too?
- Me? - Yes.
- For how long? - A while...
He can babysit when we're out at work.
- He could clean the bathroom. - We needed a cleaning man.
- Can you cook? Make meat sauce? - Pancakes?
- I need a massage - You're all crazy.
Bring us breakfast in bed every morning?
I've found one.
No, no.
The servant.
Nothing.
don't care, go away.
What a bore...
Come here.
Me and you.
we have a secret liaison.
Yes.
No luck.
- Are you tired, Arthur? - Are you tired already, mister?
There's nothing here.
- Hey, whatshisname! - Come on...
I'm talking to you! Hurry up!
Come here.
Come on. Help him.
Is this your dog?
- What's in your pocket? - Show us.
- Show us! - Come on!
It's gold.
Pure gold, see?
What's he saying?
Are you capable of finding these suns?
Here.
I see something!
There's something there, a tunnel.
Arthur?
Arthur, come here.
Come here, Arthur. Jump in.
- Jump inside, Arthur. - Jump in.
- Why me? - You get the honour, you found it.
Go ahead.
Jump in.
- Tell us what's down there. - Be careful.
Arthur!
Arthur!
THE CHIMERA
I got you water. Do you want some?
- Is everything OK? - Yeah.
Look at me.
You're the best.
Have them for breakfast.
Go for it, girl.
<i>...participation in the world cup is at stake.</i>
We've got this.
Could you sign this for me?
I'm not sure what to work on. What would you suggest?
- Show me your basic position. - Sure.
And this sport is about proportions.
but now it's balanced.
So she won everything. You can relax.
So beautiful.
Chin up a little. Perfect.
Hello, he... hello.
Hello, Father. Do you know? I won!
Get away!
It's my dad.
<i>Józsi says, he remembers when he took you to hospital,</i>
<i>you were so thin, he had to look twice to see that you'd come in.</i>
Eat up.
Stock up. From tomorrow on you're back on your diet.
Can't you extend it any further?
Knead the dough.
What happened to your skinny noodles?
Perfect.
- Hey, guys. - Hello.
Congrats on your achievement. You've got such an amazing shape.
Don't forget. You mustn't do any of these. Otherwise you'll be in big trouble.
You won't look like a bikini fitness girl.
More importantly you should be easy to copy.
That brings in the bucks. Got it?
We don't get any support. They do. And to hell with us!
Then the propionate.
Then drothionate. That's ?220.
What about the unbranded ones? They're cheaper.
And that's not including the BCAA,
Nor the 2kgs of chicken breast each day.
And the joint protector too.
Who else should I go to?
Anyway, it looks like we'll probably win.
Dear God. Do you want to feel him?
but to pay for your girlfriend's too? Don't you think it's a bit much?
But the prize is double what I'm asking for.
I'm sorry.
Are you ready?
Go on!
Close your eyes. That might help.
Let's see you move.
OK, kill the music.
Look.
It's not for everyone. Thanks.
Ádám, aren't we going?
Well then, my contact details
and we'll see what suits you.
Let me help.
She's the one.
- Bye, guys. - Thanks!
Will you show my face too?
We can't do the video without it.
People look for a physique like yours.
We could do the ad now, if you want to.
Your make-up is smudged.
Alright.
Please come in.
Tense your muscles.
Could you show me some poses?
You want one?
Done.
21, 22, 23...
...30. 20 more to go. 31, 32, 33...
You look calm.
Just a bit tired.
- How are preparations going? - Quite well, I guess.
This is what he wants.
Don't worry. It's safe.
10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4
Do you feel dizzy?
No.
May I?
Almost home. I'm sorry.
I'll be quick. Sorry.
No.
Let's go.
Let's stop here.
Here is what I want. Pay attention, please.
You move like a robot with a broken chip.
You have to seduce and charm them.
- OK? Be graceful. - Sorry.
Let's go.
Gracefully!
Got you.
Hi.
We're going through a rough patch.
Come here. Let's see some poses.
You look stunning.
Take it off before it gets sweaty.
I'm afraid not.
I had it all planned.
I'm sorry.
Good evening. Something came up. I'm sorry.
Got you.
<i>- Yes? - It's all sorted.</i>
Bye.
That's fine. You must be exhausted.
I don't feel like going home.
Thank you.
It healed quickly.
Yes, it did.
- We've got everything. - Everything?
- And check this out. - What are they?
I checked out your opponents.
So I think we'll beat them all.
21, 22, 23...
9, 10...
Could you tell me? Is she very sick?
She'll be fine.
- But it's nothing serious, right? - No, no need to worry.
I have to go.
Can you recall what happened?
Are you an athlete?
There is only so much a heart can take.
I can't do that.
When can I go home?
In a few days.
<i>You disappeared. Edina?</i>
Sure, let's go.
And during the freestyle poses the crowd went mad.
I got a standing ovation.
I hit the brake.
That's when I realised
that I'm the best in the world at something.
It makes up for everything.
You're the stronger one.
A bit more...
- Who wants to climb a tree? - Me! Me!
No.
Can you pull it up?
The girls are so quick running around. They're so cute.
Don't tense up.
Take it off.
Ádám, please change the gas canister.
Just a little for me. Thank you.
10, 11...
Where are you?
Hello.
but the room isn't paid for today. Are you staying on?
The gentleman has already paid.
Should I send the invoice to this address?
Just leave it with me, thanks.
Who's this?
Let's go.
- She could be dangerous. - Móni, please.
That feels good.
Too many pills.
One minute. Just need to pee.
Come on, let's go.
OK. Turn around, please, completely to the...
Can you lift your arm, please?
<i>Edina Kovács. Please proceed to the backstage.</i>
- Forget it. I'm here to win. - Don't you get it?
OK. I'm coming.
Edina!
Wait.
Two cappuccinos, two bacon sarnies, Mick.
Keep the change.
Cheers, mate.
Cup of tea and four sugars, please.
You've gained a bit of weight, Harold?
All right, dear?
Yeah.
How you doin'?
Edith!
There you are.
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses.
It's not happening again.
Black Forest gâteau, he's got.
Okay, it's safe. You can come in.
Right. Soon as we've had some grub,
When we get back, we'll play a bit of whist,
What?
I made that last bit up.
No, I'm not.
Bernie, what's that?
Oh, you've seen it?
Well, I know that.
What's it doing there?
It was a happy holiday. Do you remember the donkey?
His name was Pedro.
And he took a real shine to you.
His name was Manuel, the donkey.
Hey, Rene. How you doin'?
I rang them straightaway.
I'm really sorry, Bernie.
We left it too late.
Left what? What are you on about?
The trip to the beaches. D-Day.
Bernie?
Well, I... I'm sorry. It's my fault.
I should've got more organized.
I'll go there instead, eh?
-Yes, thank you, Judith. -No probs.
-Bye. -See you later.
Right.
Then beach, eh?
-Oh! -Hello, love.
-You all right? -Fine.
Oh, no, no.
-I was awake. -Oh.
Takin' me pills.
No, I... I'm putting it back.
Can't seem to, uh... settle.
Just go.
To France?
Why not?
You can't do it on your own.
But you would.
But I'm not on my own.
Your health has not been great lately.
Unless you have to.
That's okay.
Early walk this morning?
Yes.
See you later.
Shut up.
<i>This is the final call for the 8:15 sailing to Ouistreham.</i>
Are you lost, sir? Would you like a ride?
I'm a veteran myself, actually, helping out for the weekend.
-Keeps me out of mischief. -Yeah.
So, wait, so you're standing the whole way?
-Yeah. -You don't have a seat?
That's a good idea.
-Yeah, get legless, like me! -Oh?
-What? You trod on a mine? -I've only had the new peg six months.
Ooh, yes, please!
But then, I'm tidy.
I still think he shouldn't have done it.
I have to be here because of the nursing,
He misses ya!
Where is he, anyway?
He's out.
Ooh, my! How delicious. Mmm.
Okay, that's you done.
-See you later, Rene. -Bye for now.
I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
No, no, I'm... I'm okay.
I ain't got me sea legs yet.
It's a bit of a mouthful, I know.
Uh... no, no. No, thanks.
But okay.
Not you... Definitely not you.
Marvelous!
Hang on.
Fifi, you've help me find it.
Here we go.
Too slow? Too slow? You cheeky bugger!
-I wanna take you somewhere. -Oh, yeah?
I mean, only if you wanna.
-It was just this place-- -You know, uh...
Hold on.
Come in.
Bloody hell. You been burgled?
All this stuff everywhere, which is a trip hazard, actually.
You should really clear that all away.
If she was in bed at all.
Tea downstairs tonight, or up here?
-Up here. -Same for Bernie?
Really?
Will do, will do.
Oh, it's... nothing. Just a twinge. Oof!
I'm all right.
Adele, you're panicking!
Thank you.
So, who have you come with, Bernie? An association or...
No, no. I'm on me own.
It was, uh... a bit late.
I was in Halifax, towing the gliders over, poor buggers.
-Can you believe? -Oh, I can believe you.
With your accent, you could cut glass.
It's fine.
It's angina.
-Oh. -We know you get that.
If you get any more discomfort,
slip one under your tongue and let it dissolve, okay?
Fine.
If you're worried, get someone to call me.
With respect, Doctor, a couple of weeks ago
you were telling me to make the most of my time.
That was you, wasn't it?
I understand.
Thank you.
I tried the café on the front, the... the shop on Lansdowne.
He's almost 90. He can't have gone far.
But he's disappeared off the face of the Earth.
He's in Brighton.
-What? -That's where he was headed.
-Yeah. -At what time?
Yeah. She's resting.
The last thing Rene needs now is any extra stress.
Oh, and you, come with me.
Come on.
Jordan!
I'm joking, I'm joking.
Come on.
We'll fight 'em on the beaches.
I've just been hanging onto this. It's all your worldly.
Listen, do you have anywhere to stay over here?
That's why I'm asking. You could tag along with us.
We've got loads of room on the coach and I'm on a twin that's already paid for,
so you wouldn't have to spend a penny.
Thank you very much.
I'm sure he's okay. It's just after nine hours, we have to... You know.
I'll... I'll get these details circulated and... we'll issue a tweet as well.
They can... they can be very effective.
We've got the photo, that's the key thing.
I'll get this out to the patrols. Perhaps I'll give the hospital a call?
You know, just so they're in the loop.
Here.
Where were ya?
What?
It's a flowerhead, I've pressed it.
You're supposed to be taking it easy, not rummaging around.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Fish and chips.
That's so lovely.
Oh, your face, lovely. Your face!
I'm pulling your leg.
He's gone AWOL.
Well, everybody knows, but nobody's talking about it,
'cause they're afraid it will finish me off.
I haven't said anything about it either
because I want to make sure he has enough time to get there.
To get where? Where is he?
He's in France.
Ah, but he made his own way.
-At 90? -Mmm-hmm.
Only then, of course, they were shooting at him.
I've been feeling so guilty that I didn't check in the morning that...
I even bought you a large fish, Rene.
That's how bad I was feeling.
Yeah, go ahead, Vicky.
<i>He's okay, he's safe.</i>
<i>The station's just been on, he's in France.</i>
What?
He's in France.
He's a D-Day veteran, apparently.
Good lad.
Life in the old dog yet, eh?
Oh, Sarge wants me to tweet a stand down. What shall I put?
Well, that. He's a war hero,
Hashtag, "The Great Escaper."
That's me done.
No, I'm taking a walk on the beach.
I'll let you know.
Great. See you later, then.
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Cheers.
Well, 'cause you've been here before, ain't ya?
You know, with the first lot.
Piece of piss.
<i>Monsieur.</i>
-Oh. <i>-Monsieur?</i>
Uh? What?
<i>Merci, Monsieur. Merci.</i>
Over here!
Come on in.
<i>-Ça va bien, Monsieur? -Merci.</i>
Fine.
Of course.
Well, you're here now.
Have a drink.
Oh, uh... our American friend,
I'm very tired.
Gentlemen, this is my friend Bernie.
Oh, yeah. Once someone's tracked Bernie down in France
and made sure he's all right.
Mind you, I can just picture him now tucking into a plate full of snails.
otherwise she'll make herself poorly.
Well, if you're going to work in a fair ground, yes.
I don't think she's even noticed.
So Richard said, "I'm terribly sorry, Vicar,
I thought he meant something else entirely.
Here, have another olive. It will soak up the booze.
Your lot didn't invent it, you know.
Bernie helps me with them, but of course... he's not here.
Just pull the knee up a bit...
and then pull it down.
-Like this? -Oh, perfect.
In the war, if I was going to a dance,
I'd shave me legs,
Like a self-tan.
Exactly.
Only you had to be careful
because if you got hot and started sweating,
You are a really good girl.
Well, I'm just glad the day's ended like it has.
Everything all right, like you said.
Yeah. Thank you.
Listen, when you go home, get a teaspoon, put it in the ice box,
They'll disappear, and nobody will ever know you've been on the lash all night.
Gentlemen, we're going off to do some drill.
Hey! Hey, Bernie!
What's the problem?
Nothin', nothin'. I just want another drink.
<i>Non, Monsieur.</i> It's closed now.
Miserable bastard.
-It's fine. <i>-Vous sortez.</i>
-What are you looking at? -They're doing nothing.
'Cause I'm not a bloody baby!
I'm not hurting anyone.
You're gonna get yourself into trouble.
Come.
It doesn't go, does it?
Like you never leave a man behind.
Yeah... I've missed that.
British... British soldier, eh?
All for one.
And one for all.
I think that was a French soldier, actually...
You done?
We started earlier than you.
Like the Second World War.
Oh, I will.
Well... nothing left to puke up, so it's the same thing.
How did you manage that?
It's unbelievable. You're sitting just behind the Queen
and President Obama.
Of course I am.
Don't be silly.
Happy to help.
Incoming!
What's your name?
-D-Douglas... -Huh?
Nottingham.
I'm from Nottingham.
Same as these... Players.
Stand by!
Yeah, yeah, that's her.
What's that?
That's me letter... if I cop it.
Get them ready, Jordan! Going in!
What's going on?
It's okay.
Does it happen often?
That's what did it.
Do you do it?
Crisis averted.
No... It's all right.
I shouldn't drink at all, you know.
Oh? Are you on medication?
I rattle.
I'm an alcoholic.
But there you have it, it's the reason I'm here.
that's for sure, so it was now or never.
-Well, you... you wouldn't. -No.
I'm... I'm good at hiding it.
Some of the time.
Anyway, he wrote this verse called "At the British War Cemetery, Bayeux."
It's all about the graveyard just up the road, Bayeux.
You must know that place.
I've heard of it.
There are almost 5,000 dead in there.
Nearly all of them killed during the D-Day landings,
To England.
Christ.
Civilians, those on the ground...
I wasn't able to, for whatever reason, but that was the plan.
This afternoon, I was finally gonna go and... and pay my respects.
I stayed in town and I got pissed instead.
I'm sorry.
It's just... Every now and again, I meet someone
You have to be brave to do that.
We're nearly there, I promise.
No peekin'. I said, no peekin'.
I'm not.
Be careful.
Right. Now you can look.
Yeah, it's called the holy hour.
The light is just, like, different...
to any other time of day.
Normally, you just sleep right through it.
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
What?
It's a dog rose. I love 'em, they're gorgeous.
Oh, yeah?
What?
It's limited, isn't it?
Well, you gotta appreciate I've never seen
Like that.
Specially as a rose is my favorite flower.
'Cause is dead English.
-I love 'em. -So do I.
Which do you like best?
I couldn't tell you. You'll only think it's dead poncy.
It's a poodle.
So?
I mean, they're ever so clever.
My auntie had one that could count.
Morning, Rene. Your breakfast is ready.
I'm coming.
Ooh, my Lord! I'm in Piccadilly Circus.
Good morning to you too.
Oh, you haven't seen what I have just seen.
You should put some money aside, Adele, for plastic surgery.
Thank you.
Oh... What's this?
Oh, sorry, it was on earlier. It's a special program.
All the beaches. That one, that's the one Bernie's at.
-That's the main one, that. -Never.
Hey, you might spot him on the telly, Rene.
I knew it would be big, it is the 70th, but not this big.
{\an8}<i>...some form of official recognition,</i>
<i>"The Great Escape."</i>
Escape?
<i>Hi, Laura. Well, just that having been informed</i>
<i>that he couldn't go on an organized trip,</i>
...and made a break for the coast.
And then relying on taxi ferry--
He's a hero, Rene. An actual hero!
Oh, bugger off.
<i>the world has discovered one old soldier</i>
No, no. I've said I can't, even if you're with me.
I have to.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the ceremony will begin in 15 minutes.</i>
Right. Come on.
<i>Ouais, c'est ça. Ciao.</i>
-He will be delighted to drive you. -Terrific.
-And will be here shortly. -Did he say how much?
<i>Oh, non, non, non.</i> His pleasure.
<i>Oh! Merci. Merci mille fois!</i>
<i>-Et voilà. </i>-Thank you.
And don't let these guys pay this time, huh?
Hello? Who are these people?
They're Germans.
Ah, same as you guys, I guess.
To honor their fallen comrades.
Heinrich was.
Uh... Günther was on Juno, same as Jens.
You think I could talk to them?
They were involved in the landings. They wanted to say hello.
It's good to meet you.
And it was you who was here, Heinrich.
<i>Ja.</i>
Sword.
Me too.
You should go and sit in there.
Tell him he should do that.
"I... I walked where in..."
Yeah?
I've been worryin'. All the fuss and that.
Fuss? Is that what you think this is?
Nobody actually knows if he's all right, or where he is even.
-Rene... -It was between me and him.
That's how it's always been where the war is concerned.
And that's just asking for trouble.
You have to keep your head down,
Hi, Rene.
I waved him off.
Let him go.
When what I should have said was...
"You are not getting on that ship, Bernard Jordan.
And then I did it again.
and shirts of earth 5,000 lay
When history... when history...
When history with ten feasts of fire
Had eaten... the red air away"
Here, Bernie! Bernie, mate, I need a favor!
What are you doin'?
I've had a thought...
What?
I could drown and then I'm stuffed, aren't I?
And that's if they find me. I could get washed out to sea--
Just take it.
Get him ready, Jordan!
Tell Vera I... I said she was... she was--
-I told you-- -She was fuckin' spectacular.
Hello, Douglas.
I'm so sorry.
What a waste!
What a waste.
What is it, Bernie?
What's wrong?
Nothing, uh... I'm fine.
Mission accomplished.
Right.
I wanna go home.
And see my girl.
What about... the other side?
An absolute honor.
Likewise.
-I'd given up finding you. -What you doin'?
-It's a croissant. -A what?
They looked a lot better earlier.
Honest, I don't know what came over me.
Oh, really... You're young.
Forget it.
Thank you, Bernie.
'Cause, listen, you're an inspiration to me.
It's people like you that make me feel properly proud and honored to be part--
Stop it!
All right?
Stop saying stuff like that.
'Cause I know what you're going through, Scott.
But right now, you're a fucking mess.
I'm okay. I just couldn't find me pills.
I... just couldn't find them.
Sorry.
You gotta stop having these turns, Rene.
You're much too clever to be working here, you know?
Seriously, Rene, just... just tell me.
What have they said?
Stop joking about it.
It ain't funny. Why do you keep joking--
Generally.
But you!
You're like a piece of ripe fruit.
I don't care.
I knew it.
I knew as soon as you started gettin' all that stuff out,
I knew there was somethin'--
Oh, come on! Everyone does tidying up.
What does Bernie say?
He doesn't know, and I'm not telling him.
And you're not telling him either.
What?
Why not?
There's nothing he can do, he'd be heartbroken to know
I am not telling Bernie.
I found him.
Hi. Excuse me, are you Bernard Jordan?
Yes. Why? Is there a problem?
No, no, not at all. I'm... I'm pleased to meet you.
Oh, hello, Sandy.
What's this?
Please, no photos.
What's goin' on?
<i>Et voilà, Monsieur.</i>
-Bon appétit. -Thank you.
A bottle of rum. Blimey!
Rene. Rene, they found him.
-Come on! -Ow!
Oh, it's supersized.
Fuck it.
How does it feel to be back?
Great.
A note, please, next time. A note.
Hey, mate. You did it.
-I'll kill ya if you do it again. -Welcome back, Bernie.
Thanks.
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, Rene.
What?
It's like Fifi, you know?
Then I... I went on me back... and then help yourself.
-The Great Escaper. -Yes, I have seen it all.
-Bernie, what is it? -The truth!
All they want is a happy ending.
Grabbing a grip and pulling the bloody cord.
All those poor old buggers outside...
That's the truth.
That's what old age looks like.
Not for anyone.
What happened to you in France?
What?
Tell me.
I went to see this lad.
Where he is buried.
Douglas.
Douglas Bennett.
Unloading cargo!
Get 'em ready! Stand by!
Go on.
Bang!
Gone.
That's the truth.
I said he'd be all right.
He got killed...
because I made him get off the boat.
When you came home, Bernie...
you were wound so tight.
You had something inside you, I thought you'd tell me what it was.
But you never did.
he'll shatter and that'll be the end of us."
A life, without you?
I couldn't even consider that.
you've spent every ounce of your good luck
building a marriage with me.
And that's what it was, Bernie.
It was your good luck that got you through the war.
And Douglas's bad luck not to.
It wasn't then, and it isn't now.
All right, we've only done normal, little, everyday things.
Oh! Oh, hello, beautiful.
Brings back memories, doesn't it?
Yeah. We're too old to get another dog, aren't we?
We are certainly too old. We can't get a poodle anymore.
No, well, they poo all over the place.
Why do I encourage you?
Yeah.
-And it's supersized. -Oh!
But I got you a sausage.
Bernie!
Tossers.
Ooh, look who's waiting.
-All right? -Hello.
Bless your heart.
If you ever, ever, go away again...
I'm coming with you.
Mahmoud! Get up now!
<i>Uncle's coming soon.</i>
<i>Hello, boss.</i>
Thank you. Say hello to your dad from me.
Summer vacation.
Great for ethnic Norwegians, but word, it sucks for us broke foreigners.
Norwegians in Norway sit bare-assed, reading comics
Bro, dad didn't go by train and container to Norway to shit outdoors!
- Right. - The thing is:
But the fucking dogs in Pakistan...
One of the bastard mutts jetted after me. I'd had chili curry, and got the trotters.
Luckily Pakistani aunts are the best. Like, real family. For life.
After that I ate loads of naan to get constipated.
Take care of your tummy.
Word, man. The moment we touched down...
Three weeks of crap - in one go. Poor ethnic Norwegian.
Mild, no onion, extra corn.
- Move it! - I've tidied up!
- Okay, fine! - And show some respect, Mahmoud!
Dad didn't come to Norway for his youngest son to get hooked on pink horses either.
The log doesn't lie, Ali.
Why do you never do what I say?
- You expect your mother to tidy up here? - I've tidied up, mom! Look!
Don't be cheeky! Help your brother!
That's life for Paki kids. Think about it, Norwegian kids, when you don't get
Ali!
- What are you doing?! - Sorry!
Dammit, Ali. Get a grip, bro.
- So what's up? - Nothing.
Mahmoud has to tidy the room, or mom will smack him.
See you, Ali. Bye.
Hey, relax.
Freaking Kurds. They're all called Goran.
My day-one, Arif, has only one eye.
Instead of comforting him, she said,
"In Norway, the welfare office helps the blind."
But that's not the weirdest thing about Arif. Just wait. Here it comes.
I'm pretty sure nothing of this is real. Get it? We don't exist.
Nothing exists.
Okay, bro. But what's happening?
If nothing exists, then nothing's happening, like.
- And you? - I walked down the stairs with Arisha.
- Or behind her. - Behind's behind.
- Wrong name. - I've applied.
But your name isn't Preben, Aksel or Noah.
Nine. Nine names.
Two large Pepsi Max and one Sprite. Your uncle only drinks Sprite. Don't forget it!
So I don't have to wash undies all day.
I put my husband on a stone I heat in the oven. Then I feed him grass.
It's like the UN, bro. But it's not about poverty, hunger and global heating.
It's about my dad's bunghole. His ass has cost me
Mahmoud, watch out!
LAST CHEAP BREAD!
Dammit.
I didn't come here to eat overpriced bread!
No, let's eat cheap bread and shit blood.
Oh my days...
They're coming! Hurry!
- What did I tell you? - Hello, Zubaida.
- Hello, brother. - It's been ages.
- Mahmoud! - Greetings.
Hello, my boy.
Eat?
Samosas, deep-fried so they're super crispy outside and soft on the inside.
Delicious chicken karahi. Raita, with proper thick yoghurt.
Wow!
Wow!
- Wow! - Ali? Ali?
If you burp in Pakistan, it means the food is great.
- It's a huge compliment. - Hey, Shahbaz?
Does driving a taxi here pay well?
- We get by. It's only temporary. - Temporary?
It really helps if the wife also has a job.
I was supposed to have summer vacation now, but...
Women get summer vacation as well?
I must say.
- These are from auntie. - Thank you.
- Shahbaz! - Sandal.
A lota. Aluminium.
- Just the right size. - Mahmoud, for you.
Nice shirt, huh?
- "Armani", mom. - No, Ermani is spelled with an E.
Number one in Pakistan. Comes from America.
- Thank you, Uncle Ji! - Here, Shahbaz. Cigarettes.
- By the way... - He quit smoking two years ago.
- It belonged to mother. - She'll come around.
It's been ages. You never call.
- Mom and dad would have appreciated it. - You're here now.
I brought something else too. Check it out.
- Maula Jatt! - Remember?
Sultan Rahi. Oh, jeez.
He's huge in Pakistan. He was brutal, bro. Only played in gory action movies.
He's Pakistan's Chuck Norris, Lars Monsen <i>and</i> Zlatan.
Hey, man. Check out Mukkho.
God almighty.
Poor Mahmoud. You should've had a daughter.
Ali, what did I tell you about that unicorn stuff? You're too old!
Let Ali watch what he likes.
- I don't want anything from him. Get it? - Okay, fine! What do I care?
Don't take that tone with me. Understood?
Paki kids are slaves to their parents.
Thank God that Mahmoud is such a dutiful son, Shahbaz.
Mahmoud? I have to work this summer. Mom has to cook.
Someone has to take care of Uncle Ji.
My life is ruined.
I'm not Norwegian.
Not Pakistani.
What the hell am I? What am I doing by this stupid lake?
Mahmoud! Get up! I've had it!
- Get that idiot out of here! - Mom!
- Nice T-shirt, Mahmoud. Real Ermani? - Shut up.
Ermani! Everything's so beautiful!
Is there never war here?
No, Uncle Ji. Hardly ever.
and high-rises Norwegians won't live in.
Everything's so clean! Do they even wash the tarmac?
Sure, every year.
Look at that!
Hi!
- Stop it! - It's okay.
Oh my gosh.
Two months in Norway is far from enough, Mahmoud!
Come on! Freedom!
Norway!
Show me what you have behind your back. Ali, show me!
- It's nothing. - It's something. Show it to me.
Is that Arisha's?
- Hello. - Hi. Arisha?
Say hello to your dad from me. Bye.
- Hello. - Hi.
- It's okay. I've got lots of makeup. - Sorry.
- You can have it. - Thanks a lot! You're the best!
Hey, I checked my email yesterday. Five fucking rejections.
- So I logged in and changed my name. - To what?
- Noah. - Noah?
Awesome, man. Rad!
- So you're gonna apply again? - Once I've charged.
Just need to up my percentage.
Go ahead and laugh. I'm a fucking illuminati, man!
Ali? It's dinnertime. Come on!
<i>One moment.</i>
What's he wearing?
What's going on?
Seriously, what's going on?
- Fine, Ali. We're going home. Take it off. - I've outgrown it.
- Ali, listen... - Alia!
- Hey, stop hanging with my brother. - It's just a game, Mahmoud.
It's just a phase, Shahbaz.
Hey, what's he doing with Arisha all day?
Look after him?
Let me know if you want me to look after anyone else.
Ice cream or something?
- Mahmoud? - Yeah?
What do you mean, "old days"?
Uncle Ji and dad's relatives didn't want mom and dad to get married.
Yeah, luckily.
Bro?
Bro?
Are you really sure God loves all people?
Like what?
- Like I don't fit in. - You fit in.
You're an East Side Paki just like everyone else.
Hey, Mahmoud? What's that?
Then I tell him that women here get ten months maternity leave,
You get paid to have kids?!
Uncle Ji, are you okay?
I wanna live here, Mahmoud.
One, two, three...
Why should three Pakis go see Munch paintings?
Entrance fee: NOK 160.
Easy savings.
Wow! One more time!
Import, export, medical equipment, riding articles like straps and so on.
Everything is sent to Europe.
Bro, that's not riding equipment!
Word, Uncle Ji has no idea what he's making.
Everyone who's seen the Internet knows whites love to be whipped when they fuck.
After the Second World War,
they executed the traitors down here.
Sometimes I feel like an Oslonian. It should've been a separate nationality.
If anyone asked, I'd say, "I'm from Oslo."
Listen up, boys. I've found some girls for you.
Look, Mahmoud. This is Rizwana. Ripe for marriage.
- Look at that basket! Isn't it nice? - What do I need a basket for?
Come on, Mahmoud. Wake up.
And here's one for you, Ali. Neelam!
And here's one for you, Ali. Neelam!
We haven't agreed yet, but with some negotiation...
- Show us a picture of your wife, uncle. - Uncle Ji isn't married.
Why not?
He wants to know why you're not married.
I don't know.
You look like the cheapest made in China Disney princess you can get
- Did Arisha say anything about me? - No.
Did she say anything about me she told you not to tell me? You sure?
Arisha said I could come back whenever I want.
Mahmoud?
- What? - Your crazy uncle refuses to get up.
Uncle Ji? What's the matter?
Hello, Uncle Ji?
Can I become a refugee?
I'll say I can't return to Pakistan because they'll kill me.
"Tusen takk. Absolutt." There, I'm Norwegian!
This woman thinks all Norwegians need to have a house, a car, a boat
Dammit. You mean... there's nothing we can do?
Right.
- You're our guest. You don't have to help. - It's okay. No problem.
What's going on?
- Put it there. - Let me do it.
Is he gonna say I don't look after him?
- Don't you dare enter my kitchen! - Relax! Chill!
You see what I'm going through?
Go get the groceries!
What's up, Noah?
Hey, you're smart. What happens at a job interview?
- Jack Sparrow landed an interview? - Soon. Tell me.
You don't want this pen. There's no hole on top.
Wow, bro!
You sold me the pen!
May I have a pink cake? Please?
Are they men?!
Wait. Where's Ali?
- Freddie Mercury. - What?
Ali! What are you doing?
Oh!
May God forgive them. Some remove all of them.
My brothers. Do not forget your faith.
Look the other way.
May God forgive me.
Uncle Ji? Why are you up so early?
- Women. - What women?
Don't turn to look, Uncle Ji.
- Hello. - Hi there.
- Good. - Do you know her?
No, you say hi in the woods here.
- And don't stare at their asses. - What are we doing here?
And think about life.
And how they can cut down on sugar. Or how they can land a new job.
And when they get tired...
- Sylvi too? - Guaranteed.
Fucking Sylvi!
Hey, Mahmoud. What's with this bike?
- It's a rental. - Ok.
Let's go.
It's very, very nice. But guys...
27?!
- Is everything in Oslo this pricey? - Yeah.
So eat it slowly.
There's no rush.
Ten taps for you.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
"The thieves tied up their horses,"
"'Open sesame!' No sooner had he said..."
Alia Baba?
Ali.
- Bro, I'm a girl. - Huh?!
Mahmoud, you're so stupid. You don't get it.
Shoot me with a shotgun in the face, bro. I've had it with my family sometimes.
No, bro. Ali's...
- What? - I don't know anymore, man.
He keeps giving mom compliments.
I don't know.
But bro? This is between us, okay?
Born in the wrong body
- I was born in the wrong body. - Woman?
- I'm comfortable with trans. - I wasn't born in the wrong body.
Trans kids
When she turns 18, she can finally get her operation.
The most important thing is to let kids be themselves.
and we lived on the West Side with white parents.
But dad...
Shit, I don't know.
First he'd go mental for real and get suicidally depressed.
Besides...
- Mahmoud's younger brother. - What's with the outfit?
Hi there!
- Hi! - Hi.
What have you told Ali?
- He's a girl? Born in the wrong body? - Nothing.
- Where did he get the idea? He's nine! - You know what? You don't get it.
You don't know shit, okay? Just back off. Stay away from Ali!
- Go radicalise someone else. - I pity Ali who has you as his brother.
Look at that! She likes you.
Oi, Mahmoud!
- He says he's a pussy! - You wanna hear about twisted?
She's sick of doing the laundry.
The whole high-rise vibrates cause of your bladder.
Mahmoud!
- Motherfuckers! - Let's get outa here.
Get up.
Get up.
Are you okay?
Get it now? Leave! Fuck off!
Come on, boys. Come.
What's happened?
What are you wearing?! What happened?
Ali?
- Ouch. - Just a tiny...
What?
I always knew there was something wrong with Ali.
That whatever it was, it would pass.
- Am I a bad mother, Mahmoud? - No, you're the world's best mom.
Okay, not the world's best. But pretty good.
- I can't smell anything. - What is it, uncle?
- Calm down, Zubaida! - Get rid of that thing!
- What'll they say back home? - This is my house. Stop pushing me around.
It's your duty! I'm your brother-in-law! Show some respect!
What's going on here? Huh?
- Did someone beat you up? - Uh...
Mom threw a bag with some cash from the balcony.
And you two...
I spend the whole day driving a cab to make money. For all of us.
I need food and massage.
You were...
Different.
I fought for you.
Every evening.
Different.
Mahmoud? Don't just stand there. I've made paratha with omelette.
Paratha is roti with loads of butter, egg and pepper.
Paratha is roti with loads of butter, egg and pepper.
As long as everyone has their mouth full, there won't be chaos.
Father? And husband too?
I'll take time off from the cab,
and we can go to Verdens Ende.
No, why would we want to go there? No thanks.
- Tusenfryd? - Do I look like a billionaire?
- Sognsvann! - Again? We always go there.
- Only white folks go there. - Picnic! By the seaside!
See whatever you went to see. Picnic on a parking lot or something. Drive back.
No shell pants, primus or bird dog here.
"I'll kiss the ground you walk upon"
Wait! Look, the sun's coming out!
- Fantastic! - Uncle loves water.
Yes, that's right.
- Ali, be careful! - Sure.
I thought we were supposed to be together.
We are together, Shahbaz.
Come with me. Come here.
I wanna be a girl!
- Shahbaz, wait! - I'm a girl!
Come down here at once!
- I wanna be a girl! - Stop saying that! You're a boy! A boy!
<i>I'm a girl!</i>
What's happened?
But Mahmoud...
- Ali isn't a girl. - Nah...
But I don't know.
When the chili refused to burn properly, I knew there was something wrong.
What's a hijra?
Neither man nor woman.
- Ali isn't a thing. - You're right.
- Shahbaz? - That's enough!
Some families don't know what pleasant means.
Here I am, working myself to death to put food on the table.
- This one goes out, this one and this one! - Are you crazy?
Shahbaz, stop it!
I should've put my foot down ages ago!
Are you completely insane?
- Ali's our child! - He can't possibly be my kid!
Come on, brother. We can't stay here.
I'm not afraid of anyone!
- He's just a child. - That's right. Just a child.
He doesn't know what's right.
Imagine if we'd told people back home we were girls?
It would be a disaster.
- Don't say a word about this in Pakistan. - I won't.
I work all the time. Didn't even notice.
Tomorrow morning we'll set Ali straight.
This is all Zubaida's fault.
Shahbaz?
Zubaida? I need to speak with you.
Zubaida, I...
I... Thank you.
I bet you're pleased now.
- What happened? - The taxi was so cold.
Zubaida is right, Shahbaz.
- But Shahbaz, Ali will stay here with you. - Nonsense!
Let me in!
Mahmoud? Don't I deserve to use my own toilet?
Mahmoud? Don't I deserve to use my own toilet?
Zubaida?
- Take it and leave. - What's this?!
Goodbye, Shahbaz.
<i>Arif here. I'm real busy. Leave a message. Beep.</i>
Put it here.
Do you like it?
Ali?
Aren't you hungry?
Okay, bro. Take care.
- When will you stop messing with my life? - It's my duty to look after you, Shahbaz.
You can't even take care of yourself. How are you supposed to look after me?
You're just a freeloader. You've got no wife, no kids.
Have you lost your mind? Huh?!
<i>No, you have to hold my hand!</i>
That's all.
My life is an empty shell.
All day...
Go home, Shahbaz.
- I'll walk home through the forest. - The forest?
It's very relaxing.
Daddy's coming!
- Is it that fucking hard to get? - Firstly: We don't swear, Mahmoud.
Daddy!
Ali?
It's for you, daddy!
Ali! Ali! Careful!
- Catch! - Ali!
Take all of it!
Zubaida!
Ali!
- Ali! - What's happened, Mahmoud?
Mahmoud? What's wrong?
- I can't find Ali. - What?
Ali!
Ali? Mahmoud? Ali!
- I want to throw it all away. - Ali's confused.
It will pass, with God's help.
- You're confused! - You've made him a girl!
All your life you've made shitty plans. None of them have ever come to anything!
You can sit there in your goddamn taxi and scratch your balls!
- What?! - You're not man enough to be a dad!
I'll go with mom to the crisis centre.
- I mean it! Just keep your hands off Ali! - Shahbaz!
Are you pleased with yourself now?
You've never hugged your son, never looked him in the eye, never kissed him.
If anything happens to my child
because of you,
I'll chop you up into tiny pieces, you goddamn dog.
Ali is Ali.
Alia.
Alia.
- Hi. - Hello, brother.
Here's some tea.
- Zubaida? - Yes?
- Please. - I can't accept it.
- Zubaida... - Thank you, brother.
What's up?
Shahbaz would sneak out.
I made a mistake.
Forgive me.
You're a good person, Zubaida. Very good.
Shahbaz is very fortunate.
- More milk and soft drinks? - It never ends.
I know.
Maybe it'll calm down when Uncle Ji leaves.
Three less litres of Sprite. Every day.
So Alia's a girl?
Yeah.
I've noticed.
- Uh... I have to get the groceries. - Yeah.
See you.
Zubaida wasn't from our caste. It was a mess.
Zubaida and Shahbaz loved each other very much.
But I tried to stop them.
Dad had found two sisters.
One for me and one for Shahbaz.
But when Shahbaz left with Zubaida, they said we'd broken the agreement.
Isn't it time you let yourself have another chance?
Can't you put it behind you?
I've seen so many great things here. Freedom.
In Norway you can be whoever you want to be.
Except a Muslim, maybe.
- Sacred Alia. - Don't give her any ideas!
She's spoiled enough as it is.
She's spoiled enough as it is.
You have to bless me before my journey.
Thank you, my beautiful niece.
"Do not call us, we'll call you."
Take good care of your family. You're so lucky.
You fool.
Bro? Give me that shitass mobile. I'll give you a discount on a new one.
- I thought you said nothing exists? - Word, bro.
- A real job. Real cash, man. - But bro?
What happened to Noah?
Had a crazy meet with the tax office.
I looked at the broad with my one eye and told her.
It pays to lie sometimes, man.
I mean for you, fool.
Oi, Mahmoud! Get...
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it. Bullet chili and lots of yoghurt.
And Mahmoud? Get honey for Alia.
May the Goddess bless you
with a shining destiny, my son!
Hello, Cyrus!
Hilla...
Remember, I told you
The cops nabbed the thief.
Must we discuss this in front of Cyrus?
The thief's name is also Cyrus.
Oh!
Then we must think of a new name for Cyrus!
Attention!
Guard...
Attention!
Guard!
General Salute!
Present Arms!
Guard!
Ground Arms!
What is your name?
Rifleman Harka Gurung, Sir!
Harka Gurung!
What is my name?
Sam...
Mac...
Monk...
Sam Bahadur, Sir!
Sam Bahadur.
We'll be punished, Sam!
Haji's right, Sam.
What happened?
Nothing, just checking
What nonsense! Of course, I'm alive!
Then prove it!
Well?
Well?
Sam, we came here at 7,
it's 9.30 now.
This is how time works, sweetheart!
Then 11:30, and so on!
Sam, please. Let's go!
What happened?
Am I boring you?
Of course not, sweetheart!
That is Maharaj Kumarjeet Singh...
And this is Haji Iftikar,
of the famous Iftikar family.
Maharaj, Nawab...
And why not!
However...
These modern day princes
are pretty faint-hearted!
They're scared of everything:
the Company Commander, the Adjutant,
the Quarter Master,
Who knows, you might scare them, too!
Really?
You're in the Army?
Yes, ma'am...
Corporal Sam Manekshaw at your service.
I can't promise I'll remain a gentleman!
Okay, Sam...
You stay back...
The last bus leaves in 15 minutes...
Haji and I are leaving.
Gentlemen!
What's the first rule of the Army?
Well, where were we?
We're dead!
For his absence from parade
by order of Major Cowan,
Corporal Sam Manekshaw
is awarded punishment.
Congratulations!
to be awarded a punishment
Don't!
Not.
One.
Word!
And you two...
It's not their fault, Sir. I forced them and -
I said,
not one word!
The two of you,
along with Manekshaw
will be confined to barracks
Am I clear?
Yes, Sir!
Manekshaw?
Yes, Sir!
That's two words, Sir.
Satisfied now? Huh?
That night was itself satisfying!
In three weeks,
Tikka Khan is coming!
Break!
Break!
Box!
Break!
Box!
Continue?
Break!
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
Seven...
Eight...
Nine...
Ten!
Well fought, Khan!
Next time,
victory will be mine...
And then I'll offer you
the same consolation.
We'll see!
2nd Lieutenant Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw...
Your next posting
of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment
stationed in Ferozepur.
Congratulations.
I am also a Piffer!
Look how pretty I am,
with my gorgeous light eyes
and fair skin!
Have you ever seen such a pretty Piffer?
Hush, Dilsher...
He's the Platoon Commander.
Oh?
Congratulations then!
We have a girl as our Platoon Commander!
Dilsher!
and a burly athlete like you can't?
Lieutenant Manekshaw...
I...
Actually I...
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Sam.
Please, Sam!
I don't know anyone at that party, Dilsher.
It's your friend's party, you go.
I thought of going alone,
but then I realised -
there'll be so many pretty women there!
Really?
And I'm some expert on charming women?
Drop the act, Sam!
The entire unit has heard of your exploits.
And I was staring...
not at the CO's wife,
but at the cake!
The CO's wife talked about
Who... is she?
Silloo Bode.
Colonel Bharucha's sister-in-law.
Excuse me.
Sam. Sam Manekshaw.
4th Battalion
12th Frontier Force Regiment.
Hello.
I'm Silloo.
I'm sorry.
Usually, I have a lot to say...
Compliments...
But...
right now...
Thank God!
Because at every party,
every single guy says
the same boring things...
I promise you,
I'll tell you something
That seems hard to believe.
But go on, try...
I'm going to marry you.
I...
Say it after this dance.
"This little thing...!"
"This little thing left unsaid"
"This little thing, oh look"
"is now a fable made."
"Not a cloud nor rain"
"on that magical clear night..."
"nor cross the minds..."
"This little thing, oh look"
"is now a fable made."
"This little thing...!"
"The ground firmly beneath us"
"The ground firmly beneath us"
"As hearts take flight"
"making earth and sky sway."
"This little thing, oh look"
"is now a fable made."
"This little thing...!"
Mamma!
Sam, welcome!
Gurmeet...
Allied armies gather for new thrusts
World War II has reached India's doorstep.
To counter the Japanese troops,
the Indian Army has reached Burma.
As soon as we hit Sittang,
They've fought non-stop for 4 days...
If securing the bridge wasn't so urgent,
I'm pretty starved myself!
I'd give anything for some Dhansak.
Most folks swear by Rogan Josh,
but Parsi food has my heart.
Come home for a meal someday,
you'll be in for a treat!
Patra ni machhi, Akoori, Lagan nu bhonu...
Chicken Farcha,
Salli Boti,
Lagan nu custard!
Oh, man!
Feed me some of that delicious Parsi food again...
and Attiqur Rahman will be your slave for life!
and every week, you can enjoy both:
Sounds great!
Down! Down!
Thank God,
our planes chased the Japanese away!
- All okay? - Yes.
Slowly, slowly...

Yes, Sir.
Get ready to move.

Come on! Get moving!
Vehicles and equipment too.

It is unfortunate...
But we have our orders.
We cannot let the enemy

Sir.
This won't be easy...
Is war ever easy?

If Rangoon falls,
So we just cannot allow the Japanese
Opposite Sittang Bridge is Buddha Hill,
Apart from reinforcing the bridgehead,
we have to capture these hills too.
It will help us guard
and secure the bridge in a better way.
And yes...
Because time is short,
the wounded and deceased

Any doubts?
Any questions?
I know...
You've had your first meal in four days
here at Sittang...
That too, because of a misunderstanding.
"He alone is brave"
"Who fights for the downtrodden"
"But he'll never leave the battlefield!"
I'm sure you've all heard this holy verse before.
It's our turn to fight tomorrow.
Are we ready
Subedar Gurbaksh Singh Sahib?
Yes, Sir. We're all set.
They are on Buddha Hill!
They are on Buddha Hill!
The Japanese have reached Buddha Hill before us!
Bravo Company shall stay in reserve.
Alpha Company, charge to Pagoda Hill!
Meher Singh!
Move, fast!
Keep going!
You guard this position with your platoon...
the rest will charge with me.
Don't stop! Charge ahead!
Meher Singh...
I had said...
Bravo Company is also reaching Buddha Hill, Sir!
He will not live.
His eyes were open moments ago.
Please treat him!
How do you feel?
I'm OK!
What happened to you?
Anyone with this sense of humour
is worth saving!
Get him ready for surgery.
For gallantry,
Major General Cowan

Congratulations, Major Manekshaw.
Thank you, Sir!
Wow!
MC!
Well done, Sam!
You definitely owe me a Parsi feast
at your home now!
You'll be back much before me, Turq.

Several members were present on the occasion
and blessed the new couple,
Indira Nehru and Feroze Gandhi.
Good choice...
Parsis do make good husbands!
The true answer to this question,
Do Parsis really make
the best husbands?
I'll only let Mrs Khan in on this secret,
Major Khan!
And not in front of
Sherry, Maja...
say goodnight to Major Khan.
But Silloo, the custard!
Custard on Sundays for you.
You know the rules.
Goodnight, Major Khan.
- Goodnight, Father. - Goodnight, darling.
Goodnight, Silloo.
Goodnight, Silloo!
Major Khan,
Surely...
Though...
the Missus has instantly become 'Begum Sahiba'...
Not 'Major Khan', please call me Yahya.
On one condition...
You too, must call me Silloo.
Definitely, Mrs...
Silloo.
So next time,
please bring Begum Sahiba along,
Yahya.
Surely...
She was a bit unwell today.
Burma!
Yahya, when I think of Burma,
I'm reminded of the doctors there...
Those bloody buggers, I tell you...
They gave me such bad stitches...
that by the time I returned to India,
they were infested with maggots!
Even the maggots were better than those doctors.
Thanks to them,
Excuse me.
Sam...
war gives us stories...
but to women...
they give nightmares.
Silloo...
Get custard made tomorrow.
Sam!
They're kids, Silloo...
Where to?
My room...
Because of these?
Because of your snoring, Sam!
Areas with Hindus in majority
will become their country.
Areas with Muslim majority
What mercenaries the British are...
Turq has chosen Pakistan.
He was saying that
Mr Jinnah has personally asked you
to join the Pakistan Army.
So?
What have you decided?
You're not a Hindu.
I was born in Amritsar,
my wife is from Bombay,
and I work in Delhi...
How much more Indian can I be?
Morning, boys!
What's happening?
We've been given orders, Sir...
will be with the Indian army,
and the ones falling in Pakistani territory
will not leave this office
until the Indian army
Yes, Sir.
Major Khan hasn't asked for Indian maps...
I know.
but he can't fathom it yet.
Congrats on the Frontier Force Regiment, Captain Farid.
And to you on the Madras Regiment, Captain Srini.
Cheers.
Cheers.
This one...
I love you more than life itself.
Speech!
Okay, okay...
To the fatal choice!
Punjabi!
Punjabi! Punjabi! Punjabi!
Fine!
Here.
to the cruel choice before us!
to choose another colour!
Here...
to choose one side of our heart.
To the Army!
To the Army!
To the Army!
To the Army!
To the Indian Army!
Sam...
But now...
I have only one wish.
Sam...
I'll really miss you.
You both have taken such good care of me.
Keep the bike, then.
Hey, Sam!
Thank you!
You're selling it?
How heartless!
Not heartless, sensible.
I'm leaving the bike outside...
send me the money later.
Goodnight, my friend...
And goodbye.
Long years ago,
we made a tryst with destiny,
and now the time comes
when we shall redeem our pledge.
when the world sleeps...
India will awake to life and freedom.
This is Pakistan's response.
Pakistan has agreed.
That until talks take place
That means we'll have to accept
Neither should you disagree.
Until the Maharaja makes up his mind,
Don't say yes...
Don't say no.
Lord Mountbatten?
I wonder why...
What a great parting gift they've given us!
They came to one country,
Hindustan and Pakistan...
Hindus and Muslims...
Sir.
Hazara,
Afridi,
Mahsud...
Even Pakistan army soldiers
who were on leave...
are crossing the border in truckloads
to attack Srinagar!
And you all knew about this.
The CGS,
the Officiating DMO,
and the Defence Minister!
When were you planning to inform me?
The intel wasn't solid. Kalkat's report-
Major Kalkat, you tell me.
'Operation Gulmarg' is a masterstroke, Sir.
One solution to Pakistan's three problems.
The Pathanistan Movement will be crushed.
The tribals will get land for settlement,
and Kashmir will belong to Pakistan.
And you're sure
Yes, Sir.
Pakistan Commander-in-Chief General Messervy
sent the operation plan to Brigadier C P Murray.
they put me under house arrest...
But I escaped.
Brigadier Murray knew,
but he still didn't inform us...
Yes, but we need
Maharaja Hari Singh's decision first:
No?
Menon...
Leave for Srinagar right away...
And...
Yes.
Relay all this information
to Srinagar airfield as well...
I need all of this done in the next hour.
Sir.
Major.
Our pilot has informed us
that the Srinagar airfield runway
So?
for Delhi before sunset.
So we have only half an hour to do this?
According to the latest reports,
the armed tribal groups
have reached Baramullah.
Only 35 miles away from Srinagar.
If they get to Srinagar
and capture the airfield...
Maharaj...
Secretary VP Menon and-
while those plunderers are taking over Kashmir!
Seems like I'll have to handle this on my own.
I'll fight...
I'll fight with my army!
Your Highness...
And you just got the news?
You've come too late.
This is my home...
and to protect it,
whether it's mine, or of my enemies.
Your Highness...
Please come.
Please come...

Easy to fire.
Easy to handle.
And reloads in an instant.

8-10 shots at the very least.
My soldiers and I are trained for it.
You please handle the politics,
as you are trained for it.
Your Highness...
Please come.
I'll see you at the airfield, Mr Menon.`
Is it done?
But there's no point...
We won't be able to reach Delhi.
I can now see
why I was asked to take you along.
What's the matter, Sam?
Mission accomplished.
Bosses will be happy!
My boss won't be happy.
I had promised her
that I'd be back home by 7.
And in any case,
only your mission is accomplished.
Our mission will
begin only now.

And what did I get?
I'll soon be cooking, sitting inside a saucepan!
This is Akashvani. And now the news.
The Indian National Congress held
a special election in Delhi.
Mrs Indira Gandhi
Major General Manekshaw...
I must admit,
Thank you, Sir.
What could be more reassuring for a Defence Minister...
is in your able hands!
Right, Kaul?
Sir.
Thank you, Minister.
which can make it better.
Of course, Sir!
I'm sure we can greatly benefit
Which front did you fight at?
He may not have field experience,
I'm sure!
This way, gentlemen!
There's something else I wanted to ask you, Sam...
I wanted your opinion...
on a few Officers.
What do you think of General Thimmayaa?
Please don't.
Today, you're asking me about my Chief...
Tomorrow, you'll ask
The Army's discipline
is its very foundation.
...Minister.
So what if I don't have war experience?
I'm his senior officer,
and the Chief of General Staff!
That's why he's jealous of me.
And that's why he hates me!
No, no...
Sam doesn't hate anyone.
He just loves himself more.
The only problem is
that everyone else loves him too.
Especially PM Nehru.
We must do something, Sir.
Anti-National?
there are other serious charges too.
An enquiry must be done, Kaul...
But Anti-Nationalism?
This letter, such charges...?
You've seen his office, right?
It's been 14 years since Independence
but he's still loyal to the British.
He's forgotten
that his seniors and ministers
are all Indian.
His biggest problem is...
Not one problem...
There's a list of problems.
But is this list
enough for an enquiry?
not some junior officer or Corporal!
Of course, Sir.
And...
Impressive, Kaul!
So it's your field,
and your rules...
Manekshaw residence.
Hello...
Hello?
Sehroo Bhai.
Silloo... what's the matter?
No, it's nothing...
Just that inquiry.
And Sam?
Sam...
You know him...
Ask him anything,
"I'm OK!"
Anti-National, and you?
Sam...
This Kaul...
He's always been jealous of you.
Professional disagreements are routine, Silloo...
Why would Kaul have a personal problem with me?
You think everyone's good at heart.
What if...
What if they win, Sam?
I already won
I'll handle the other battles as well.
I'm OK!
And everything will be OK.
Soon.
I promise.
Come inside...
That Batliwala?
Silloo...
Our daughter will become 'Sherry Batliwala'!
but this is too much!
This Court of inquiry has assembled

That have been brought to the notice
Everything alright?
This... isn't right, Sir.
Things will be alright...
The first matter against
instead of Indian leaders,
Yes, it's true...
not Politicians.
The second charge is:
Violating the orders of your senior Officer.
Wilful Disobedience.

That you deliberately ignored.
You mean he was expecting
a response to that?
My apologies
that I failed to send
an appropriate reply.
Let me correct that mistake right away.

But yes, if he requires workers or labourers,
I know a few contractors.
Perhaps they can also explain the difference to him...
and what soldiers do.
Sir, someone in the mess told me...
No, Sir.
No, Sir..
Major General Manekshaw say:
'He doesn't want his Officers
It is time to conclude
the findings of this Court of inquiry.
I agree, General.
We needn't waste any more time
Major General Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw...

They are utterly baseless
and without any merit.
This enquiry is
But I had told you...
Swami...
Very soon, the sandwiches will have no filling at all!
That's it!
I'm banning fine china in the house.
From now on, we'll only use steel.
I've been saying this for ages,
Filter coffee tastes better in steel mugs!
And I also taught you
Your filter coffee is far from authentic!
And now, an important announcement...
After China's attack on Assam,
Prime Minister Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru
shall address the nation...
Chinese forces have been
aggressively attacking our borders.
Right now...
Enemy forces are at Assam's doorstep.
We have lost Bomdila as well.
No, Prime Minister!
This isn't right.
Why?
If the Prime Minister
"Indian and Chinese, brothers-in-arms!"
Of course he's helpless.
Sam...
What about the promotion?
Any news?
You should have been a part of this war, Sam...
You're a soldier.
You belong at the front...
with the other soldiers.
I know that Swami wants me out of the house...
but you, too?
I can't fathom anything myself.
This war, this defeat...
I can't see my own future.
Please give us 5 minutes.
Prime Minister.
People have lost faith in the Army,
and the Government.
but we've been careless too!
Instead of making
our Army combat-ready,
Krishna Menon must resign.
And...
Kaul must go too.
But in this situation,
I know.
The gentleman in the waiting room -
Please send him inside.
I believe you know Major General Sam Manekshaw.
Sam, Indira.
It's Christmas morning.
Everything should be relaxed and easy.
Bert and Lorraine will be seated together.
Take your positions.
What happened?
Very good.
So?
Where's our next posting?
Tezpur, Assam.
But not 'our' posting,
just mine.
It's a non-family station, Silloo...
The on-ground situation
is still dangerous.
I know.
It's not easy.
I know.
for you,
for us,
for the girls...
That's where you belong, Sam.
With your soldiers.
We will all be OK.
Who?
Indira.
She dresses well.
Time will tell.
Delhi is so far from Assam,
it feels like no one remembers us.
Your quarters are this way, Sir.
Commander Sir.
Good evening, gentlemen!
Good evening, Sir!
for any human being?
and others' girlfriends!
Answer me, boys!
His life, Sir.
Correct.
But for a soldier,
even more precious than his life...
His uniform.
a soldier can even sacrifice his life.
Right?
Yes, Sir.
You haven't eaten today?
Am I right?
Yes, Sir!
From today, no officer or soldier
shall withdraw from his post
Gentlemen,
there will be no more withdrawals.
Sam is here!
Yes, Sir!
This is the Commander Sir we needed...
Who tells us what to do!
I know what to do.
We've been studying
Our team has prepared a plan.

and most importantly...
Sam...
Sir.
Chairman Mao has declared a ceasefire.
I agree with Panditji.
A wait-and-watch position
The situation has returned
Normal, Minister?
The situation was so 'normal',
not just their posts,
They don't want 'normal'.
What they want is a chance
They want reassurance,
They don't want 'normal', Minister...
They want to win.
And I want to win.
before the passes close down.
Or their supply line will be cut off
Instead of waiting for them
to make a move,
we must secure ourselves first.
and give them this chance,
You're not going anywhere, Sam.
Our soldiers are raring to win.
So we'll just let our soldiers become cannon fodder?
It is a soldier's duty
to die for the nation.
I beg your pardon, Madam.
A soldier's duty is
Okay, Sam.
What do you suggest?
which must be secured.
Panditji!
I think it's the heat and humidity, that's all...
I'm sorry, Madam...
You don't have security clearance
Please wait here.
That's the spirit, gentlemen!
Yes, Sir!
Yes, Sir!
And no one can snatch this away from you!
Yes, Sir!

But the flames of discord rising in Nagaland,
Mr Defence Minister.
So tell me Sam...
what have you thought?
I wasn't aware that the Indian Army
gives its Officers a choice!
What do you think, Sam...
Which is the most challenging posting
Wonderful!
China on one side,
East Pakistan on the other...
and problems all around!
Just choose any nice photo, Sam...
It's been a year since Sherry's wedding,
You can't take a single decision at home,
God knows how you manage the Army!
Doesn't listen to anyone. Just does his own thing!
What's the matter, Swami?
your new transfer order arrives!
At ease, boys.
What's going on?
The Rifleman is saluting me, Sir!
Any reason?
I was on my rounds, Sir.
Rifleman Tamang didn't salute me.
For not saluting a senior Officer,
I've given Rifleman Tamang
Tamang?
I didn't see the Captain.
Good job, Captain.
Thank you, Sir!
Carry on!
So Captain,
you will return every salute
from Rifleman Tamang.
Very well!
Come, Behroze.
Sir, just a reminder:
We will drink rum, Behroze.
Arrange rum for everyone.

Hey, Behroze!
you must have a drink in your hand!
That's an order!
Sir, why do you call Behram 'Behroze'?
Got selected in the Army,
and got posted in Signals.
One day, during lunch,
he calls me and says:
'Sir, if I can't work with you,
I'll quit the Army!'
I was hungry,
and the line was poor...
I heard Behroze instead of Behram.
And ever since, he's Behroze to me!
Party over, gentlemen!
We have to get to work.
Sir, how did you know...
my direct order.
Now tell me.

Apart from the locals,

He's 16, Sir.
He calls himself Lieutenant Miram.
He's my son.
No Sir...
no one forced him into this.
It was his decision to join them.

Sir!
Please have mercy on me!
Sir!
Have mercy, please!
Sir.
Sir, he was trying to bring his brother back home.
Do they have reasons to return home?
Escort them back to their village.
Sir.
Let's go!
My son!
These people are in a fix.
and if they do, the Army and Police punish them.

That's it?
I had 9 Japanese bullets in me!

as the President of Pakistan.
This is Radio Pakistan.
Pakistan Army Commander-in-chief,
General Yahya Khan
shall now address the nation.
Fellow Pakistanis...
Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan's speech
which was broadcast yesterday.
He called upon me
to carry out my prime duty...
of protecting this country
from utter destruction.
I have imposed Martial Law
I urge everyone of you
to cooperate with my administration.

I'm about to kiss someone?
Yes...
Chief of Army Staff,
General Sam Manekshaw.
The promotion's great...
what brings you to Pahalgam?
Oh no, sweetie...
I like meeting my soldiers often.
Now, is there anything else?
No, thank you.
Very well.
Dippy!
He is Lieutenant Colonel Depinder Singh,
my Military Assistant.
Will you please escort the lady out, sweetie?
You call everybody 'sweetie'?
Honestly, I thought you were flirting with me!
Sweetie...
had I been flirting,
this interview would've gone on much longer.

And now, international news...
American President Mr Richard Nixon,
will soon arrive in India.
Get ready for the spectacle, Dippy!
May I ask you a question, Sir?
Apart from my wife's phone number
and my bank account number,
you may ask me anything!
Being in Delhi,
away from your soldiers?
We're going to Delhi, Dippy...
You'll realise that
battles aren't fought only on the front.
What's new?
Yahya Khan himself was appointed by Ayub Khan.
They were friends, right?
We were friends too.
Jai Hind, Sir.
Lance Naik Tejinder Singh, Sir.
You might not remember,
back in 1954, my unit was in your Brigade.
Army Number 33 52 312.
Your first dinner function, Dippy?
You have a new name, Sir.
'Sam Bahadur'.
You've been called many names by many people, Sam.
But this name
is my favourite.
Is this table fine, darling?
Dippy...
All good! One moment...
Oh hello...
One whiskey, with lukewarm water.
So, Mr Sam...
One moment.
Young man!
Lieutenant Amar Sharma, Sir.
Lieutenant Sharma...
This is Defense Secretary Sarin.
He was a bit confused
That's been cleared now.
Come, son.
I need to meet some people, sweetie.
I'll be OK.
Dippy...
Yes, Ma'am.
About how all battles are...
where you've brought your wife!
seat your wife at her favourite table,
disappear for 10 minutes.
Ma'am...
Don't believe me?
Alright.
Go to Sam, and watch.
Ma'am.

Our soldiers deserve a good life.
exactly who lives where!
Absolutely.
Ex-servicemen should have
a minimum pension plan.
It's their right.
One day, I'll retire too.
You are too charming, General!
Thank you, sweetheart.
It's all thanks to your presence!
You are looking lovely,
Prime Minister.
Thank you, Sam...
'Bahadur'.
Can we discuss the budget now?
Mr Sam...
Is this an occasion
to discuss the budget?
Mr Sarin, could there be a better occasion?
The Defense Secretary,
Defense Minister
I need equipment for the Army.
I was told that
higher up for approval...
I fear that by the time the file reaches you,
I would have retired.
I'll look into it.
Thank you, Prime Minister.
Didn't I tell you, Dippy...
Battles aren't just fought on the front!
Correct, Sir.
I learnt a lot today.
But the most important lesson I learnt today:
No matter how many wars a man wins,
he's no match for a woman's mind!
Hello, Sir.
Sir, he wanted to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Sam!
Yes.
Phone.
Who else!
Who?
Stay.
Is everything alright, Prime Minister?
Problems are many, Sam.
Well, you always have
this shoulder to cry on...
that you are my problem?
Me?
What have I done?
But do you intend to?
As in?
As in, a Coup...
Martial Law?
Like what's happening around us...
What do you think?
or I won't?
There's a difference in capability and intent,
Prime Minister.
I have no interest in politics.

You kiss your own sweetheart,

I'm sure you understand
why I was worried.

This time, the fight
is for our Independence!
And I will give my blood again.
Tonight.
Your country, my country...
Bangladesh! Bangladesh!
Free it! Liberate it!
Please! Please!
The Butcher.
Tikka was known as 'The Butcher' in IMA.
And now, after the operation at Dacca University,
I guess he's become 'The Butcher of Bengal'.
This butcher
has murdered hundreds of people, Sam...
in East Pakistan?
His soldiers are making people
dig their own graves before killing them.
Bengal, Assam and Tripura...
You will have to enter East Pakistan, Sam.
That would mean war...
Are you ready for war?
Because I am not.
Please agree, Mr Shyam.
April is coming to an end.
The snow will start melting in the Himalayan passes
and open the way for the Chinese forces.
In East Pakistan, the Monsoon is about to arrive.
With snow melting above
and the rains below,

and they won't get Air support either.

with being in such a position,
but I certainly do.
I don't want to lose.
Prime Minister...
Now give me your orders.
Chief...
Please stay back.
Prime Minister, before you say anything further,
I have a question for you:
or tomorrow morning?
What you just told us,
is it true?
Telling you the truth is my duty.
And I fight to win.
Prepare for war.
Only preparation...
No immediate action.
The war will begin on this day.
Whether we start it,
or them.
The refugees pose a human problem
and it has to be settled
on that basis.

Any initiative, Mr. President,
in solving the problem
and other related issues
The phone, again.
Must be her again.
What are you doing, Sam?
Breakfast, Prime Minister.
Have breakfast with me today...
Prime Minister.
Mr Kissinger,
Ambassador Keating...
General Manekshaw.
that makes his intent very clear
about East Pakistan.
You know Mr Kissinger,
there is this boy in Rajiv's class,
who thinks it is his business
to stick his nose
into everyone else's business.
But instead of going around
asking for help,
I told Rajiv
to restrain the powers in Pakistan
with regard to this matter.
nor I can do anything in this matter.
This is a ridiculous situation.
over a few refugees.
Mr Kissinger.
but the global repercussions
of any hostile action
taken by India,
will be...
tremendous.
I have no other option...
I will turn to General Manekshaw.
I would suggest
that you insist upon Pakistan
to make conditions right
for those 7 million refugees
If you don't...
Well played, Prime Minister.

Sam was right.
Madam, may I ask you something?
you got news of Pakistan's attack.
But your face didn't as much as twitch.
And you're smiling even now.
Sam had written down...

Tonight.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
put forth his stance on the issue of ceasefire.
We will fight.
We will go back and fight.
I will not be a party
I don't agree, Prime Minister.
It was wrong of us to put the Indian Army
without giving our forces a proper chance...
This is just unfair, Prime Minister.
It has to be done, Sam.
Go to Dhaka tomorrow
Aurora should go.
All the world admires
a deed, well done.

we can say
that we have done
this action

Stop!
I'll kill you!
Stop it!
Let him go!
...what's his name, who was smoking by the door?
and let me practice with his car.
I'll say he's my brother. Will they check ID?
But the sun's out, too.
Take them off!
Fine.
and that's why it won't stop raining.
- That doesn't make any sense. - It was on Instagram.
...that this rain doesn't come from own sky?
Pull left, let him pass!
What?
You're not paying attention. Check the mirrors!
Pay attention and nothing will happen.
You can't use your phone!
I'll tell him I can't talk now.
Watch your distance!
Hello?
I won't be there for a while.
What time is it now?
Flood warning's for further west. We're at...
where are we?
What happened?
Hi. How are you?
Perhaps the road to salvation is right behind this closed door.
Perhaps God wishes to see you standing behind this door.
- Hi. - Hello, son.
Are you so full of dread that --
- She was crying in front of everyone. - Crying means she's telling the truth?
She has the address. She followed you on the bus.
I wasn't on any bus yesterday!
She says she saw you at some woman's place.
You know her. She'd never start a scene with another woman.
Picking up your stuff, and I delivered it, didn't I?
So she's lying?
I don't know!
She's mixed up.
She's off her meds because of the baby.
Bye.
Saturn Driving School
What?
Don't hit the brakes!
Get my bag.
Open it.
No, the green one.
What is it?
Farzaneh?
- Yesterday. - Right. What time?
Bandar Abbas.
I was in Bandar Abbas from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
That's the receipt.
The shipment's in dad's storage right now.
It was you.
Can I start my pills again? Maybe a lower dose?
What for?
Don't listen to her.
It's not anxiety.
Let it go.
It's not anxiety.
It's hallucinations.
- What? - Hallucinations.
But I swear... I saw him.
I'm not lying...
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
I felt sick.
But don't take them.
That wasn't you on the bus?
Please tell me.
I swear it wasn't me.
What if I go crazy?
I'm here. I won't let that happen.
Yes.
Of course not! Let's go.
She can see me from up there.
Let's go together. You can tell her whatever you want.
You go. Call me if you have to.
Come on...
Swear!
On the baby's life.
All right.
Let's go.
What happened?
What did she say?
Some man opened the door.
Jalal!
Car keys?
I've got a lesson.
I really do!
Bye.
Jalal?
Mrs. Basiri, did you call to have the roof checked?
Hello, Mohsen! I'm glad I caught you.
The repairman came while you were out.
Can you come take a look?
- I'll go buy one right now. - But I have to go.
Sure.
I'll be back soon.
Have you seen my husband?
No, but I don’t think you know yet.
Know what?
Oh my God!
Keep flipping through.
Yes.
But she's younger than me.
It's from a few years ago, after our wedding.
You too?
- June? - June 6th.
Farzaneh is two weeks younger. Farzaneh, my wife.
She was born June 18th.
I don't know.
Even if we were brothers...
It doesn’t make any sense.
It just doesn't!
So what now?
I don't know about you,
- Does your wife know? - Not yet.
I'll have to be gentle telling her.
Can you send me this?
Is that okay?
Sure.
I want to show my husband.

Bita Jabbari.
What?
Well, obviously.
Yes, but... she doesn't laugh like that anymore.
Hello?
I can see your shadow
behind the door!
Open up! I know you're in there.
Jalal?
Farzaneh!
Farzaneh!
What are you doing here?
Is everything okay, Mohsen?
Who's Mohsen?
Who is Mohsen?
Let's go in.
How can this be, Jalal?
Her husband, too?
Yes. She showed me his picture.
Let's go.
Farzaneh...
No.
We should leave.
Jalal, let's go.
No.
Yes, in first grade.
We should go.
Can you get up?
Hi.
Hi.
Who called your father?
Why are you interrogating him?
I was supposed to get him.
Don't you want to ask why I was late?
They'll be here in two hours. Where were you?
Bardia!
I got distracted for 15 minutes. What's the big deal?
- What happened with Ghiasi? - None of your business.
Take these off.
Do you need help with your math?
You look different.
Different how?
You did something to your face.
You look hot!
Do you have any other homework?
No, Mom.
I know. They're coming over to watch it.
I want to watch with you!
Explain it to him.
Won't you say anything?
- You can watch it on my phone. - Ok.
You swore.
What if you got upset and something happened to you,
or to the baby?
So much for that!
Who is that guy?
How would I know?
Tell him it's me, that I won't leave Tehran.
Any punishment but a transfer!
Tell them I'm unstable.
The situation has changed.
His back...
You said you just slapped him.
- Hi. - Hi.
I brought the washer, but you were gone.
The what?
I'll take it.
- Are you okay? - Yes.
Farzaneh?
- Hi. - Hi.
How's your wife? Is she better?
She isn't talking much.
Well, it's a shock.
She's asleep.
So it's not a dream?
Oh, no!
Seriously.
I wanted to tell Mohsen. My husband.
Yes.
But I don't think he'd believe me.
You have to see it.
I'm sorry.
No!
I'm glad you came.
I know.
Bye.
Wait, Miss Najhand asked me to give you this.
Who?
The neighbor.
The washer.
I do!
- I won't apologize. - He won't apologize.
Other than apologizing.
- I should've killed him! - See?
What if he tells his sons: "I should've killed your dad"?
The things he said...
- First time being accused of graft? - Yes, it is!
It's a lease!
You see!
You don't think you made a mistake?
You beat the old man to a pulp.
Yesterday at the hospital his wife pealed an apple for him.
If I apologize, it means I stole that money!
Shut up!
Listen,
if the family complains to the head office,
you'll definitely be transferred to Kerman.
If you want to go back, why drag us into it?
That's not a bad idea. Bita can handle it.
- Call Bita. - Do it.
Hi.
It's Bardia. Why are you talking like that?
Which hospital?
I'm sorry.
Okay, I'll go right away. Mohsen, I'll call you back.
Farzaneh, if my son sees you he'll pass out!
Has something happened?
"Has something happened?"
I said I'd call you back!
Nothing, I just have something to do!
Farzaneh!
My son is right in there!
Maryam!
I should never have agreed to be building manager.
The rain hasn't stopped for a week.
I told him to pay last year's rent and maybe the rain will stop...
No way.
- Stop that! - Who's there? Open the door.
No.
Why are you crying?
Why aren't you crying?
My heart races when I'm alone at home.
I have to go. Visiting hours will be over soon.
He'll come tomorrow for sure.
He couldn't make it today, so I came.
I'm so ashamed.
I apologize.
Will you come with me?
- Where? - I have an idea.
You don't even need a test.
Isn't it obvious?
Why do you carry a phone if you never answer it?
Hi.
I said come here, please!
Bardia, turn that down.
What did they say?
I don't care about the transfer.
You have to go see him. You have to apologize.
You can stay here. I'll go to Kerman until it settles down.
You haven't seen him.
- Things won't settle down. - Whatever!
Fine.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, no...
Don't cry.
How can I tell people
That's what they say.
That’s not enough.
What?
I'll do it.
- You can't. - Why not?
They'll know.
My own wife couldn't tell us apart! How will they know?
What'll you say?
The other side.
I told everyone about our car. Now they'll think I was lying.
That's alright.
Tell them your dad lets you sit on his lap and drive.
That's no place for kids.
None of my friends have been trampled.
- You always have an answer! - Watch your mouth!
Where are we going?
I have to do something. You'll wait in the car.
I have to pee.
We'll find a bathroom.
Jalal!
Go wait in the car. Your dad and I will be right back.
Says who?
We'll talk about it later.
This is the men's room, ma'am.
I'm sorry.
Will you wait in the car if I promise to take you?
- You really promise? - Yes.
You swear?
Let's go then.
Mohsen is there.
- Don't come out! - Okay.
Wait right here till I come back. Don't go on the street!
Here?
Was Dad telling the truth?
- About the match? - Yes.
- Okay. - Don't say a thing.
- Is he here to apologize himself? - I don't know.
Excuse me.
Keep him from coming upstairs and I'll go get it done.
After that, whatever happens, happens! Don't be afraid. Let's do this!
Mohsen!
What're you doing here?
Go to him and I'll be right back.
- Didn't you ask me to take care of it? - That was yesterday!
What?
- I'll be right back. - Just forget it.
They said they'd kill you, not me.
Give me the letter.
Give me the pen.
Sign it.
Here?
Dad, can I sign in your place?
Okay.
Oh my God! Jalal!
He signed.
Bita!
Go.
Which one's his room?
He signed!
Come on, let's go!
Why is there blood on it?
How should I know?
Let's go.
I've been here all day.
I told you a hundred times to drop it!
- I forgot. - It's ok...
I've had it with this kid!
Mohsen,
- Can we please not argue? - Tell me where you're going.
Give me the keys.
Bita!
- Bita! - What?
- What's going on? - We'll talk when I get back.
I want to talk now.
I'll only be gone half an hour.
Mom?
- Oh my God! - It's nothing.
- Those animals! - It's fine.
- Did you bandage it yourself? - I'm not an expert.
Mohsen!
Mohsen!
Morteza?
Hold on.
Hi.
I'm fine.
Yes.
and said I was sorry.
They beat the shit out of me, and then they signed.
Yeah, they signed. I've got it.
She used to be a nurse.
She says hello. Bye.
Dad?
What's wrong, Dad?
Yes, I did.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me what it says here?
- Whose is this? - It's mine.
This one's yours, but what about this one?
You took a test just because she looks like you?
You wouldn't laugh if you'd seen her.
This is his wife.
The rest doesn't matter.
And if you're not twins,
I've had patients like you before,
some worse.
After you give birth
I'll bring her, you'll see for yourself.
A regular person. This is all a dream.
What should I do until then?
you might harm the baby.
Yes?
Who're you looking for?
Wait a second.
You’re going to have to get used to the wet.
Oh no!
What's wrong?
You're still here!
We're leaving soon.
Did Bita tell you?
No. My doctor did.
We won't see you and you won't see us.
Like it never happened.
Never happened? Is that even possible?
Yes, it is!
Take care of your own life.
Do you even know why your husband got beat up yesterday?
Go deal with your life.
- Hi. - Hello.
I'm sorry, is Jalal...
I'm here.
Why don't you wait to find a place before you leave?
Mohsen's gone to Kerman.
- He already left? - Took half the furniture.
to make a pickup at customs.
You don't know Mohsen.
The match is next week. It's only eight more days.
That's what he said. He wants us to leave after that.
He's right!
I promised. We shook on it.
Why?
No.
Jalal?
You're bleeding!
- Who cares! - It's okay.
Ask a question that has an answer.
Yours doesn't.
They walk down the street and run into their clones?
- What does that mean? - This!
Whatever it is, it's bigger than us.
Hi.
It's me.
Tell him...
please call an ambulance for...
Shokouhi Boulevard.
This has to end...
Take care of Jalal.
I was the mistake.
Farzaneh!
Farzaneh!
Farzaneh!
It'll be okay.
You'll be okay.
Jalal!... Mohsen!
I'll go down a minute and see what he wants, okay?
Why would we, sweetheart?
Everything's fine.
You rascal!
Let's go for a ride.
- But Bardia's alone. - We'll be right back.
What?
No.
No.
Just to talk.
- You missed the U-turn! - We'll take the next one.
That's okay.
Maybe for you, but my son's alone at home.
- He's asleep. - So what?
Stop the car.
We'll be right back.
What?
Farzaneh isn't home.
- Pull over! - What for?
What are you thinking?
Not a big deal? What did I ever do to make you think...
Where is Jalal?
Where?
Right there...
Behind the stadium.
Let's go!
- What about Bardia? - Just drive!
Jalal! Jalal!
Look at me!
Mohsen! Bring the car!
Jalal!
Jalal!
Jalal!
I'm so sorry...
Farzaneh!
Farzaneh!
Hi.
I went to sign your discharge papers,
a few more days.
I wanted to...
If you'd called me just a bit sooner,
I'd have found them.
but I didn't find them.
I guess it's fate...
Your name is listed as the patient, and Bita as the one
who brought you in.
I said they'd made a mistake.
Everyone thinks it was you, because it was the driving-school car.
When your father-in-law went to identify the bodies,
naturally he didn't know.
So he's given them your name.
And I know you love children.
saw me, and smiled.
You probably thought I was Jalal.
Do you remember?
"Maybe it'll work..."
they can't keep the bodies in the morgue much longer.
Hello.
Hello.
I miss them very much,
my son and daughter-in-law.
- I'm sorry. - That's okay.
You and your husband.
It's...
- Hello. - Hello.
I'm Jalal's father.
Go inside.
Go on, darling.
What's wrong?
Who's that man?
I don't know, sweetheart.
He's crying.
Do you hear?
We don't want to think about it. It was a dream and it's over.
It's over.
I'm sorry for your loss,
It wasn't easy for us either.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
Who was it, Dad?
No one.
Bye, sweetheart.
Hi.
Are you Mohsen's son?
Yes.
Do you know me?
Yes.
What's wrong?
That woman...
Who?
That woman isn't my mom.
Jalal?
I'm not afraid.

But what is this?
What should I do with this?
Ahh..!! It's killing me.. Really!
If we don't fix this by tomorrow, we are all dead.
Why are you talking like that for such a small thing?
Then you shouldn't havemade the mistake, to begin with!
Will you?
I even checked everything on the surface.
It was my moving day, so I took a leave yesterday.
I'm soon going to promote you to Team Leader's position,
I'm sorry.
then make sure to control additional cost and labour charges.
but if we do so, the workers will do the remaining work half-heartedly,
you are well aware the on-site situation.
What?
By the way Mr Kim, I'm very uncomfortable with your behavior lately.
Please don't mind me saying this,
We were just talked about the work-related issue.
Weren't we talking about work?
Yes, we were talking about work,
Isn't it you who is confusing work-related discussion into a personal talk?
Ah. I already spent a lot because of moving house.
Enjoy the coffee..
But no matter what, he's doing it purposely.
Ah..! That kind of feeling will kill a man.
Or I will kill that Manager Kim.
That's is crazy love.
This woman has gone crazy!
As harder the life is, we should be calmer. Get it?
Life is too hard!
Hey, you can't break yet!

Really?
It was delivered to my house
and it's almost brand new. Very clean.
There he goes again!
What was that about?
Even I didn't know!
What the heck!
No wonder Manager Kim is causing a fit.
Manager Kim doesn't have any feelings for you.
I have something urgent to take care of, so I'm sending my brother.
Aish..!!
You're the person whose selling the iMac, right?
My sister had something urgent to take care, so she sent me on her behalf.
Yeah, yeah! Come in.

Don't worry, I'll fix it for you.
Manager Kim?
I majored in engineering.
Stop eating and let's go,
No! It's fine,
I'll take care of it myself.
Dont' worry.
Manager Kim, I'm really okay with it.
- I told you let's go! - Alright, let's go together!
I said, let's go!
You said that you've done engineering.
Yeah, but that's basic engineering.
This is electrical engineering.
Should I help you in unpacking?
No.
No, thanks. You should leave now.

Damn! Where did you go?
But one more case came from the department.
It will take so long to catch a criminal?
Excuse me!
These cases have come from the department in the last two days.
Even if everything is fine, solving such cases is not a word of mouth.
That means it will take a long time.
So please be patient.
We will try our best, go home for now.
I'll give you a call.
Okay, I got it.
So how to find the culprit?
How to catch the criminal?
Okay, got it!

We can deliver it tomorrow after 5 pm.
So, it will be a little difficult.  Please sign here.
Ah!  I'm not letting go of that jerk easily.
Where are you?
300 dollars.  I am going to go out of the country, so I am selling it.
Oh..I caught you..!
He really used his brains for this.
<i>This guy is a fraud.  Don't buy it.</i>
<i>How much will you give?</i>
Online sites like SNS ID, Password, Education, Job and Misc will be required.
<i>No one will know who posted it?</i>
Undoubtedly, all you need is a mobile phone.
<i>Only if it is SNS, I am thinking about the rest.</i>
Then just say the name.
<i>This guy is a fraud.  Don't buy it!</i>
<i>Was going to make a deposit, but something big happened...</i>
<i>You stole it, didn't you?</i>
<i>Don't you have anything to do?</i>
<i>Three days is enough to catch someone like you.</i>
<i>I already lodge a report to the police, be prepared to go to jail!</i>
You got late because of the washing machine again?
No, sir, I'm sorry.
So?
I stayed up all night to catch that scammer.
Because of this you are late for work.
Apart from going to field work,
I told you no matter what, you have to reach the office on time?
I clearly warned you, didn't I?
Yes, sir
Delicious!
Take pictures!
Look at it!
Hey, take some pictures too!
Wait..
This is Jang Soo-hyun.
Selling used goods.
Dialled the wrong number.
Hey, check it out.
So delicious.
Hello?
What? What's on sale?
Washing machine?
Yes.
No, I'm not.
What's going on?
What would I sell my washing machine?
It's too much, taking over the mood.
What is happening? I feel like going crazy.
<i>You should picked up if someone calls.</i>
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>
God, that man is crazy!
Huh?  Hello?
<i>Can I go get it?</i>
<i>Sold out!</i>
The chicken has arrived!
I did not order.
I did not order!
I'm sure someone ordered from 302.
What is, seriously!
I didn't really order it.
Cash or card?
I didn't order any chicken!
What's the matter?
Jajang noodles and sweet and sour pork meat.
It has nothing to do with your previous case. Hence it will be investigated separately.
A separate case will be filed and investigated.
Tell me?
First, change your phone number.
Well, I'll get to the site soon, but for now you go home.
Yes, don't worry.  Sorry!
Go safe.
I'm sorry, but  I think she's in a hurry, that's why.
I will go crazy
Well sir!
Did something happen?
I have very bad eyesight.
Oh, is it?
Yes!
It's impossible.
I will contact him later, please come later.
5171?
Yes.
But it says user is not registered.
Listen boy, this number is available on the site.
Tell me what I want to know for now.
Yes, sir
There is no other CCTV?
Money is not the issue here. Generally people here don't like being recorded.
Frankly, it is difficult to investigate without evidence.
Wait, where are you going?
To flat number 302.
What do I do now, detective?
Well, we're calling all the restaurants and will handle this matter.
302?
Huh?
Is it for 302?
Yes.
Okay..
Lots of noise around.  I have to move somewhere else.
You need to move out.
I don't see any other way.
I hate you!
One more?
Please, no..
No!
He will suspect me on everything.
It's tiring.
- Be careful. - Yes, go in.
Bye...
Bye...
Who are you?
I have come to install CCTV cameras.
It's done.
Is it CCTV?
No it's not.
Is it done?
Thank you
Thank you
It's very hot, isn't it?
Take it too
<i>Done with the moving?</i>
<i>Yes, but haven't unpack it yet</i>
<i>Not yet? Were you busy?</i>
<i>Yes, a lot has happened. How are you mom?</i>
<i>The AC broke, so I went out to buy another one.</i>
<i>Why is the card not working?</i>
<i>Didn't you make your payment last month?</i>
<i>Is it?</i>
<i>1.1 million won.</i>
<i>How is dad?</i>
<i>He went to work.</i>
<i>My passed father go to work?</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Is it you, jerk?</i>
<i>I forgot to checked about your dad.. Hahaha</i>
Who is it?
Your boyfriend said,
that you need a partner tonight.
Ah!! There's someone waiting at the door, so what are you doing?
Hey, hey! Open the door.
Hello, this is from Unit 302.
A strange man is trying to enter my home.  Please come, come quickly.
There is nothing to fear.
<i>I tried so hard to invite someone, why did you drove him away?</i>
<i>Five million won.</i>
Hello, I came as you said.
I came...
Hello?
Hello?
Officer Kim...
You come here.
If there is any problem please call this number.
How do you know the password?
Well, he even sent me videos of his girlfriend.
It's personal...
Hey!
Huh?
Didn't they call? What is the number?
This fucking jerk!!
I feel wronged too..
What did you say?
<i>Jang Soo-hyun... Your hometown is in Daejeon.</i>
<i>Awarded in design competition from Hyoncho Construction University.</i>
<i>Join Kim's studio. Currently the team leader.</i>
<i>Are you proud of doing things like this and harassing people?</i>
You are too scared to show your face.
<i>OK, just bring it on.</i>
That is why.. Go and take a look at that scammer location.
Yes, I went there but got nothing.
I could not contact him.
If you can't contact the number, isn't that strange?
Go and try again!!
What about search warrant?
Did something happen to the new tenant?
I came to make sure of something.
Excuse me!
Is there anyone inside?
What happened?
Oh my god..
What is going on?
It's a crime scene!
Hey!
I said that no car should enter!
What is it doing here?
What are you doing?!
Be careful, be careful.
Miss Jang Soo-hyun!
Miss Jang Soo-hyun...
I have to go.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir.
We will deliver you safely.
Come on.
Will deliver carefully.
Did you find anything?
This case has been transferred to us.
You already have many cases... Is it possible to investigate it thoroughly?
Now let's go inside and find out.
Talked to someone he recently contacted.
The bastard ordered the fridge through the victim's phone, and placed the body in it.
He is supposed to come to testify today.
We need to investigate further.
Please let me go as soon as possible.
What smell is that?
I was so mad that I commented on that account that he is a scammer.
And since then it all started.
Chicken delivery!
I did not order.
Did you order?
No.
Pizza is here!
He called again and again.
He even knows all about me.
My things were disappearing every time i got home
How do you know it?
That bastard came to me.
This cannot be. Stay with me for a few days.
How is that possible?
You said someone died!
How to leave alone like this?
I'm fine. Police is guarding outside.
Let's go back.
Did something happen?
Let's all go home.
Leave everything in place and go take a rest.
I will call him then.
Sir...
Worked hard enough today.
Worked hard today.
Goodbye everyone.
Hey, you should rest.
I am handling this.
No, sorry.  You can go home first.
No, no. I'll finish up here.
You should go home now.
Really..
Be careful on your way!
Miss Soo-hyun.
Manager Kim, why are you here?
I've heard it all.
I'm okay. You can go now
You should have someone by your side right now.
I am really okay. Please leave.
Soo-hyun!
Please leave!
What are you doing?
I'll stay with you!
Try to understand my feelings!
Why?
Hey!
Hey!
Do you hate me so much?
You should look at people positively!
Think of yourself as something big!
I don't like you that much!
Fuck!
I'm going!
Geez!
God!
Everything is clean.
Not even a hair in the bathroom.
Checked, but could not see his face as he was wearing a helmet.
This jerk...
Miss Jang Soo-hyun...
Can you continue staying here?
Miss Jang Soo-Hyun.
Miss Jang Soo-Hyun.
Miss Jang Soo-Hyun.
Miss Jang Soo-Hyun.
Miss Jang Soo-Hyun.
Please take some rest.
Detective Joo...
For the sake of necessity, I have come across other cases.
I found six similar cases.
Why I didn't know about these?
These cases have not been investigated?
There are no follow-up complaints as well.
Hello?
Did something happen again?
I'm going there now.
Hospital?  Why?
Are you sick?
Which hospital?
I'll tell you later
Soo-hyun.
Let's go to Nonyang Crossroads please.
I'm in a taxi.  I'll call you on arrival.
Should I do whatever I want?
Should I?
Please.
If you call the police again, we will start from the beginning.
Yes, hello.
Is Miss Jang Soo-hyun still in the emergency ward?
I can't contact her.
What is that?
Let me see.
What is this?
Phone location records.
Oh well.
He asked me to let him know once I could figure out the exact location on each date.
Detective Jo...
He is always there.
Hey, who are you?
I am Soo-hyun's manager. What are you?
The Washing Machine man.
That crazy guy.
I heard all about you.
Soo-Hyun has suffered enough because of you.
Because of you I was called stalker too.
Take that off!
Let me see your face!
The CCTV...
Are you ok?
Detective Jo!
Detective Jo..
Detective Joo!
Get up, Detective Joo!
Can you hear?
He has taken her, and his car is just walk past you.
He is going fast.
Move on!
Go ahead!  Go ahead!
Fucking damn!
Ouch!
Move away!
Na Sung-hyun!
Sung-hyun! Sung-hyun!
Na Sung-hyun!
Sung-hyun!
Na Sung-hyun..
Come to your senses, Sung-hyun!
Come to your senses, Sung-hyun!
Someone please call 119.
Miss Jang Soo-hyun!
Miss Jang Soo-hyun!
Miss Jang Soo-hyun!  Miss Jang Soo-hyun!
Can you hear me?
Fill it to 100 ml.
Yes, sir.
Get an ultrasound of the ribs and look at the chest.
Yes, sir.
Is it available?
His blood is saturated now.
Out of saline, need one more bag.
and we have asked other departments to help too.
But just in case, always stay with your friend.
I'll administering a sedative.
Soo-hyun, are you okay?
In such a situation, people should stay close.
If you keep doing this, then you will get worse,
You will keep think about strange things too..
Call me as soon as you hear this message.
There is no CCTV footage.
How's the case going?
Oh, you come.
I kept investigating on the case based on the information you gave,
but it gets trickier.
That is what you should do.
I don't see any solution.
Until the culprit is caught, the situation is out of our hands.
There is nothing else to do.
So you're just going to hand everything over them?
Sung-hyun... He...
He really...
Can I know why you called?
Detective Na has passed away.
There's no CCTV footage anymore, I'll have to look for him on my own.
Can you recognize him after i find him?
How about this one?
We won't be apart for too long.
I'll find you soon, understand?
I'll find you soon.
I'll find you soon.
I'll find you...
Yes..
Detective Jo!
What if we make that asshole come to me?
What if that asshole find me?
People who live alone, away from their families,
Will you be okay?
I'm the only one who has seen his face. So should try at least.
Is this really okay?
What else to do.
Yes!
Miss Soo-hyun, where are you right now?
I went out to meet the seller.
I'm almost there too, stuck in a jam.
Huh?
From the second-hand website.
It's not you?
But the world is so dangerous now that I have come instead.
Well...
Excuse me!
I wanted to check if the product is working well.
Yes, definitely check it out.
Sorry, but my trunk is full so it will take a while to get them down.
Ok then...
Almost there.
One minute!
It's you right?
You still haven't learned from experience.
Now let's see how's your life nowadays.
What is this?
Damn. What is this?
Detective Jo..
Please come quickly.
Come quickly
Open the door
Save me!
You were hiding, you thought I wouldn't find you.
No one knows me except you.
Do you think so?
Do you think that no one knows you except me?
Detective!
No!
Die!
Why you always get in the way?
Fuck!
Die asshole..
Please take.
Ma'am, please take one.
Yes, Miss Jang.
Take one
What is this?
A police officer discovered the situation and starts an investigation by collecting relevant evidence. However, during the course of the investigation, the perperator had died.
Meanwhile, even after the death of the criminal is confirmed,
According to police statistics, in the past year,
It has more than doubled compared to previous years.
What I want...
So cool!
Aoi?
Doesn't he look so cool?!
What? If so, that's insane!
So insane!
Yukio, you gotta do that! What the Principal does.
"Well then! Mr. Yamaguchi has decided
to quit school for personal reasons."
to prepare you for the start of the new semester.
Everyone, now that we welcome the new year,
What do you want to become?
I see.
I need to attend the opening ceremony, so just rest here.
Maho?
Thank you.
Well, that's all from me.
I will now introduce some of the teachers
Nice to meet you all.
I am Haruto Higashiyama.
which is one of the best preparatory schools in the area.
where you can feel much closer to nature.
And this city is also a land of many historically important sites,
including the Nitaka Ruins.
This town and Nitaka High School is one of the
best places in Japan where you can study while feeling close to history.
As a Japanese history teacher, this place is a dream come true for me!
I will be taking over 2nd Year, Class C starting today.
Apart from that,
we have also received permission to establish a new club activity called the Ruins Research Club.
I transferred to this school in order to get killed.
I...
Morning!
Morning, Higashi!
Oh, you did. Looking good!
You think? I do.
He didn't notice. Say I look cute!
Not sure.
Then, let's bury it later.
Here, thanks for this.
Yes. A little longer?
Hey, about Aoi.
Could it be that she likes Higashi...
You guys, quiet down.
Got it.
These two battles are collectively called the Mongol invasion.
Sorry, I've got plans today.
No way she's coming.
Ready to go home?
RECRUITING NEW MEMBERS
Aoi?
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, the club?
I'm interested in the ruins of this town.
possible that it is a ceiling stone of a side-mouth stone burial chamber,
placing the date in the 7th century.
That's amazing, Aoi!
You wrote it.
I'm joining.
were similar to those excavated from the northeast.
This pattern is exactly like that.
Well, there's a possibility that it was bartered and distributed,
Hey, Aoi. Could you be...
Sorry, it's nothing.
You're wrong.
Alright.
Sorry about that, Mr. Ikushima.
You're too loud.
Well, since you're a man, I'm sure you understand.
I don't really know why you would look at your students that way.
Oh, really? Then I apologize.
Seriously.
at a female student as a sex object.
and so I reported it anonymously to the school board.
I was then assigned to fill that vacancy.
I love my Pamela.
Your Palema?
No, you see…
-Baby.
Baby, you're ruining it with a cigarette.
-Yeah. -You've been shunned.
You're ruining it with your breath.
My breath?
God, this is crazy to see.
Look at this guy.
Oh my God.
Oh wow.
Come, my angel, take my hand.
Would you marry me again?
Yes.
Bye!
Bye, guys.
Tonight, June 1st--
Hearing the tone of my voice, I was happy.
When I saw those videos, I got so emotional 'cause I thought,
I'm looking for a feeling I can't find.
Whether she's racing across the sands of Malibu in her red lifeguard suit,
or posing on the cover of Playboy.
I'm Pamela Anderson, Miss February 1990.
You do the Playboy and Baywatch.
Tommy, Pamela, turn around!
Why do you think printed materials are so obsessed
That infamous sex tape stolen from their home.
If they've heard any of the tabloid rumors,
it paints a whole idea of another person and who I am.
So hopefully, I can only surprise people.
-You're not an actress? -No.
-What are you? -I don't know yet.
I'm here.
I'm living in the house that I grew up in,
Okay, good girl.
and I always kinda know what I'm doing when I leave.
It's, like, the truth serum.
you look at the stars,
and everything comes to you.
Oh my God.
Believe me, I can't run in slow motion on this beach.
April 1st, my dad would pick me out of bed,
Like, happy April Fool's.
And we had to swim, April 1st, and it is freezing here.
It was a tiny little shack.
But my dad was a poker player,
My dad liked to race cars.
And my mom has a scar across her whole forehead.
because her head went through the windshield while pregnant with me.
And we like to joke that's probably the reason I'm a little bit crazy.
I love the island.
Living by the water.
People are very friendly.
Ladysmith is a beautiful little town.
And Vancouver Island is the place to be.
Pamela was born July 1st, '67.
She hit the paper the minute she was born.
Pam was the first centennial baby.
Pamela was always at the store.
"That'll be $50 for Pamela's bill."
And I says, "Bill? What bill?"
She says, "Well, she charges up chocolate bars here
and puts it on the tab."
So they were just still raging.
And my dad drank a lot.
They fought quite a bit.
My mom was vacuuming during a hockey game.
I just kinda knew when to take my brother out.
then we'd come in and they'd be, like, up against the wall, or on the table,
just kissing, or throwing themselves in the room, slamming the door,
Felt like the same energy, though.
We ended up leaving my dad a couple times.
There was mail by the phone.
too many bad memories, I guess, for my mom,
But I realized no one has a perfect childhood.
I had a babysitter.
And my parents thought she was a great babysitter
but she was molesting me.
It was, like, three or four years of abuse.
She always told me not to tell my parents.
I tried to protect my brother from her.
I tried to kill her.
So, I thought I killed her with my mind and I couldn't tell anybody.
But I was sure that I did it. That I wished her dead and she died.
I lived with that my whole really young life.
When those traumatic moments happen, I would just leave my body
and float away, and I'd make my own little world.
I just thought I had to get off the island.
I was a gymnast and so I was tiny.
I bloomed very late.
Then I got one lump on my chest,
Then everything was like, bam, bam, bam, and then crazy from there.
And now here we are.
More than two lumps later.
What's this?
Oh my God.
I figured one day I'd get here.
'cause now I'm here surrounded by my stuff.
I mean, basically, my life is all yellow legal pads.
if something were to ever happen to me, that there'd be evidence.
I was wondering,
Or what are you thinking about that?
I don't even think I'll watch this documentary.
'cause you go through it again like you're going through it for the first time.
It's… it's painful.
"I'm glad I got this diary."
"It should really help."
"I love words."
"They send me leaving this ludicrous situation behind."
"Come with me. I'm paving the way."
"The world opens when I write."
"Life keeps playing tricks on me."
"I try to find ways to be seen amongst the nonsense."
"Some more than others."
"XO, Pamela."
One of my first boyfriends,
and I did a gymnastic dismount into a ditch.
So… things that come in handy.
And she'd go, "It's all attached. Don't go to the mainland!"
I went on the ferry, and I got there, and eventually I met somebody.
I moved in with him,
and he was having an affair with somebody.
that's a sign that they're probably having an affair.
And I wrote down, "Washing penis in the sink, suspicious."
My girlfriend had friends who were Labatt's beer representatives
BC Lions, Canadian football.
And I didn't even wanna go.
and we're all wearing the Labatt's beer T-shirts.
And I remember seeing it going, "Oh my God, that's me."
And my friend that was with me worked for Labatt's
So I had to pick a number out of a bowl.
Like, it was just huge and just…
Not too long after that my phone rang and I picked it up.
This woman says, "It's Marilyn Grabowski from Playboy,
"Playboy?"
for this October '89 cover and we think it should be you."
She goes, "It's for real, guaranteed."
but I'd never been on a plane before.
And I was like, "What?"
and I went to another airline.
I get there, and the same lady was there like this, like, "Nice try."
So the only other way to get through, get on a Greyhound bus.
It really made me nervous.
So I got into America, to Seattle.
"Off the plane, big city LA."
"I go straight to the guy holding the bunny sign."
"Very low-key."
And I landed on gay Pride day.
So I called my mom and said,
"Gay people exist, they walk around handcuffed together in pink hot shorts."
She goes… "You've arrived."
"I thank him way too much for letting me sit up there."
looks me up and down."
"I'm a mess."
"But she tells me they're so happy I'm here."
"I'm lost in amazement."
Is that Tony Curtis? Was that Scott Baio and Sean Penn?
And just beautiful women in long silk gowns,
"Then another one comes out and chases her with a glass of champagne."
"Wow, gorgeous."
"I feel very average at this point."
I was there in my acid-wash jeans, my Nirvana T-shirt,
"It looks like they're going to have to color my hair."
I got that Sun-In stuff
When I was young, I was painfully shy.
I hated my body.
"Like, why don't I look like that?"
And I always thought girls were beautiful and guys were beautiful in school,
but I never thought I was one of them.
so much shame about what had happened to me.
"I was 12, 13-years-old with my friend."
"We went to a friend's condo."
"She went upstairs with the guy she had a crush on."
"I started to play backgammon with her friend downstairs
"I couldn't bear to hurt her more."
"I didn't tell her or anyone."
I tried to forget it.
Like, I really had this image of "I had sex" on my forehead
I think a lot of confusion.
It made me super self-conscious.
"Photo shoot."
"Shy at first,
"To the side. Am I doing this right?"
And I was like… Like, that's where a wild woman was born.
Now I was gonna take the power of my own sexuality,
and take my power back, and I did it I think in a really big way.
put my fingers in my mouth,
and then my hair became my prop."
I felt like this is something that I'm good at.
Not that I'm good at good-looking, but I'm good at it.
But you are that person in that situation.
And I thought, "Okay, I did it. I did Playboy."
"I'm going home."
But the next day Marilyn Grabowski took me for lunch.
She said that Hefner really wanted me to be a playmate.
"I think you have a career here."
Be free.
"The price you pay for clean air."
"I like driving here."
"Everybody seems to know where they're going and want to get there fast."
"That's miles per hour."
"I got my new dog, Star, today."
"He's going to be so loved."
I moved to a little apartment. I had one plate, one fork, one spoon.
"There's really no way I should be here."
"Coming from a very isolated small town, an alcoholic father."
"I lived in an imaginary world."
"I certainly don't blame my parents for my upbringing."
"I'm a survivor."
"XO, Pamela."
Well, it used to be-- Don't think we need more.
No one needs to see my body anymore.
My mom always talked about beauty, hair, makeup, and all that stuff.
Five dollars for a box.
I am real underneath it all.
I've never sat across from an interview subject before and said,
What are they? Who are they? Those things I'm just tagging along with?
I always said my boobs had a career and I was just tagging along.
No, you don't wanna see them now. They're in rough shape.
Um…
-Where'd I get my boobs done? -Yeah.
Jesus, that's a personal question, but I'll let you…
Let's talk about this.
-You were not under-endowed, were you? -No.
"I mean, this is just incredible."
I remember when I was with Kimberly Hefner,
and she's married to Hefner.
So that was it.
Choices in the moment.
they weren't that newsworthy.
But I was just pretty naive.
When someone asked me, I said, "Yeah!"
Have you ever had work done?
Why, yes. These are implants, Larry.
It was disturbing 'cause it was, like, "Oh my God. Really?"
"Is this what we're talking about again?"
But you roll with it.
Yeah.
Those are beautiful, uh, jewelry.
-Thank you.
So much has been written…
Who would you wanna be, and why?
I could be you.
Yeah, that'd work.
I think it's kind of inappropriate to ask women those kind of questions.
which would be more interesting to people.
You know, than my body.
I moved here when I started working for Playboy, so everybody that I've met
And they called and said,
"Would you come for an audition for Baywatch?"
It was about the California dream.
a weekly series about the brave men and women called lifeguards.
They always tried to get me to come and audition in Marina del Rey,
I was like, "That sounds really far, I can't go." I just ignored it.
Susie and I knew this was the girl. And she canceled on us 11 times, okay?
By the eleventh… And we kept going into these auditions
They said, "Are you Pamela Anderson? Like, one famous never for showing up?"
And I said, "Yes."
And she just had so much energy
and so much, uh, personality.
So that's how CJ was born.
And action!
Not as surprised as I was.
How are you, CJ?
How's Larry?
Or if something wasn't working, they'd say, "More seagulls!"
and he would be slingshotting, like, crackers in the air.
Scare the birds, please! Scare those birds!
When it comes to viewers,
there's one show that's in a class all by itself.
not that it really needs much translation.
It wasn't really about the storylines.
And when it came to eye candy, no one was sweeter than Pamela Anderson.
She turned slow-motion running into an art form.
Her magnetism just radiated.
And we realized we had something in Pamela that was different.
Going to Europe to promote Baywatch was crazy.
My first guest became an international superstar
from her role on Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson.
The very lovely Pamela Anderson.
"That is my dream."
"I'm going to work very hard to help that happen."
Whoo!
I've always had this property and I abandoned it for, like, 25 years.
So it was really rotten and decayed.
to look after them.
And then COVID hit and I said, "Okay, I'm staying."
Darn it.
Then I got married Christmas Eve.
But he's a good Canadian guy. Normal.
I'm like a spawning salmon, just coming home to die.
Terrible.
Nineteen-ninety.
I was, like, making a cake for Mario's 33rd birthday.
That's a long time ago.
"January 8th, 1990."
Why would I even write that down?
'Cause God forbid you do a documentary one day in your life
I dated a few other actors, but only for short periods of time.
Well, just… Well, Scott Baio.
Oh, off Scott's dad, for $5,000.
He was really mad because I would drive Scott's Mercedes
That I had to drive something like a Hyundai.
Eric Nies?
"December 18th, 1992."
"We are finally off Baywatch until May."
"It's me."
"Totally Pamela."
Mitch, I think I'm in love.
Oh no, CJ. Come on, not again.
You just met the guy.
You say that every time.
No, this time's different.
I met Kelly Slater on the set of Baywatch.
He was my big love, actually.
Oh, there's Kelly.
When he had hair.
So handsome.
and lots of girlfriends for him too, but it wasn't just me.
my girlfriend and my friends.
He definitely was a heartbreaker.
But you don't own anybody.
"I'd rather have loved for an instant than a miserable life."
"I love being in love and being vulnerable and being giving."
I love to live a romantic life every day.
I remember talking to Sylvester Stallone one time.
And I was like, "Does that mean there's number two? Uh-uh."
He goes, "That's the best offer you're gonna get, honey."
"You're in Hollywood now."
Say hi!
I was part owner of this club called Sanctuary.
Tommy was there.
Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee.
Rocker Tommy Lee.
The Mötley Crüe drummer with the bad-boy image.
I gave everyone a Goldschläger shot to celebrate,
but Tommy thought it was only for him, so he came bounding over everybody
After that night, the phone wouldn't stop ringing.
And he was leaving messages saying,
"My Bologna has a first name, it's L-A-R-G-E."
But I was out the door one day when the phone rang,
He goes, "Hello?" I was like, "Tommy?"
And he sounded really sad, he goes,"Hi."
And I said, "No, you're not coming to Mexico."
I was like, "No, you can't come there."
And I was like, "Shit!"
And when I got there, I told everybody,
Well, we're in Cancun.
Un-freaking-real.
That is where we're going tonight, La Boom.
It's somewhere over there.
And then Tommy was leaving messages.
"I'm here with some buddies. I'm going hotel by hotel to find you."
"What could possibly go wrong?"
I said, "We leave tomorrow."
"Let's call him and let's have one night with these guys."
So it's, like, super techno.
They all looked the same.
And my girlfriend, Alexis, she said, "That one."
which I'd never tried before.
You know, I have light eyes. And I thought it looked so cool.
All a big happy blur.
Later on that night, he just looked at me and he goes,
"You wanna get married?" And I was like, "Yeah, I do."
And he goes, "Okay."
"Tommy and I couldn't stay away from each other."
"And from then on, it was a fantasy, my fantasy."
"Now I finally like you enough to get married."
Whoo! We're getting married today.
-I know. -What do you think about that?
Awesome!
And so, after a few days together in Cancun, we got married.
Hey, lovely girl.
were our wedding party.
My maid of honor was somebody that we met in the club that night.
We were lying in lawn chairs, sipping Chi Chis.
I'm the luckiest girl on the planet.
My beautiful husband.
What's your problem?
Little baby Coronitas.
And I remember asking, "What's our last name?"
He goes, "No! That's somebody else."
Baby doll.
I got your booty.
Hey, gorgeous.
That's my baby.
Look at those toes.
All sandies.
No, no, no. I like it.
No, leave it.
Bye, Cancun.
And then from the plane back to LA, I remember going to Tommy,
"Do you eat eggs?"
And it ended up being one of the wildest, most beautiful love affairs ever.
We landed to so much paparazzi.
It was crazy.
Everyone was in shock.
They're in newlywed bliss.
Some have said that marriage to Pamela Anderson
-Soon, soon, soon. We wanna have babies. -Yes.
We're moving in today.
Whose are you?
Get up, sleepy.
I'm recording the whole thing.
We always had these camcorders.
Then you fill the tape, and put the tape away and label it,
But those were moments I'm glad we captured.
When are you gonna get me preggos?
And we went there to announce that we were going to do Barb Wire.
Barb Wire was the only real movie role I had.
asking articulate questions about the art of moviemaking.
That wasn't the case at Pamela's though.
Are you trying to get pregnant?
Well, how many do we want, baby? Two or three.
Two. Yeah, but we're working on it.
But after the Cannes Film Festival,
they changed everything because they thought this is gonna be huge.
So they switched directors and they switched storylines,
and I don't even know what that movie's about.
I have no idea.
And action.
I had the BWV, the Barb Wire Voice.
I really just tried to talk very low.
Don't call me babe.
I was like, "Oh God, that sounds terrible."
I was shooting all the time. I was shooting Baywatch during the day,
Tommy and I found out that I was pregnant.
We just were so excited.
How cute!
and… and take up my time.
and you still have to work 18 hours a day."
There they are, hard at work.
I just feel fortunate I'm doing a movie in my career, so…
I mean, I'd like to do more projects.
"I'm so excited about my career."
"I'm wanting it more now."
and, you know, you can really only work so hard.
She came in and she looked horrible.
She was pale and shaking so bad.
We just were completely devastated
because we really wanted to start a family.
When we were leaving the hospital, paparazzi were following us,
And then I slam the door open
and Tommy's putting his boot through the windshield.
It was crazy.
We were just like, "Everybody, stay away from us."
Well, I had a miscarriage.
-Barb Wire did not do well. -It didn't do well, no.
So, in many ways, your first failure.
It wasn't the box office hit everyone imagined.
But after the miscarriage, I wasn't really thinking about Barb Wire.
"I'm so depressed."
"I just did what was in front of me to numb the pain."
"I never got to deal with the grief of losing my first baby."
"I'm devastated."
Halloween party? This was before Dylan.
This is… that's, uh, Tommy's 37th.
-Let's push play. -Okay. I guess.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Whoa! A double-decker!
I have that shot so many times.
I just paid, which is, um…
-Well, that's good. -Water!
Videotape me preggos. You haven't videotaped my preggo belly.
We got pregnant again.
I was so happy.
My wife looks like she's having just a wonderful time.
Today's not a good day. I feel sick.
No filming Pamela on those days.
"Tommy."
"He is love, sex, rock and roll,
sweet,
don't forget talented, romantic,
and a bad drunk."
Crown me.
"We are reckless and hopeful,
and may just have a unique way of living that's right for us."
Fish and chips with vinegar.
-What do I do with these? -Put them over your boobies.
Whoa, baby!
I love you.
Bye.
Baby, look what you did to me.
"March 20th, 1996."
"I wonder how our life will be."
"I can't wait to play with our little baby."
Dad's already drinking beer.
That's me!
"I have a little person inside of me, depending on me."
Go film the paparazzis, they were all around our house.
That's insane.
Yeah, it was awful.
Someone's gonna be a daddy in a couple days.
We're having Brandon tonight!
June 1st.
"I'm aching with excitement."
Is he coming, baby?
in our bedroom."
Hey, Momma.
Hi, baby.
Congratulations.
Baby, we made a burrito.
Seventeen hours of natural labor.
Hi, Brandon.
It's Daddy and Mommy.
Baby, you're a daddy.
It's a whole new life now.
He was born at 3:05.
3:02, I think.
But we didn't realize everything was about to change.
Okay, say bye, guys.
Bye.
We're slowly getting it done.
The koi pond.
I had all the corks from every champagne bottle saved in there.
Hey, your radness.
We were in the house one day
and Tommy went to get something out of the safe.
"Like, who-- Where'd you put the safe?"
And he was looking at my assistant, John Roberts, at the time.
And John was like, "What are you, crazy? I have no idea."
We filed a police report.
But nothing happened.
because we had construction going on at our house for quite a while.
It could've been stolen in a six-month time period,
was gonna be something that would hurt us.
But then, one day, we got something in the mail.
It was wrapped in brown paper.
It was a VHS tape.
Oh my God.
I love you, Tommy.
I love you!
Talented man.
Where's Daddy?
But we had no idea who sent the tape.
Here we go. Caught on tape.
If anyone steals this tape, you're going to hell.
-Brandon.
Not too long after that…
…we got a letter from Bob Guccione from Penthouse.
He offered to buy it from us.
He said, "I'll give you five million in cash for the rights to this tape."
We said, "Fuck you. Give us our tapes back."
This was not supposed to be for anybody else.
Couple weeks later, Tommy watched the news and he came up and goes,
He told me that there's this girl at Tower Records impersonating me,
We saw it all over the tabloids, the newspapers.
The tape is out.
Such an invasion.
We're angry and hurt and upset.
Do you have any remorse for exploiting celebrity or non-celebrity lives?
There was paparazzi everywhere.
It was our first night out after I had Brandon.
My parents were watching Brandon.
-Hey! -Fuck outta here!
Fuck off!
Tommy, get in.
Then we got pepper sprayed.
We didn't spray anything.
How dare you do that to me!
because this was stolen out of our home.
and then sell it in front of the whole world.
A tape was stolen from Tommy Lee and myself.
And we said, "Sure."
There's no question of that.
It's been exploited all over the world,
and everyone's making money off it.
I really feel that… that we'll… we'll get them.
that Pam and Tommy turned down five million dollars cash.
They didn't wanna release that tape.
I will continue to fight not only for myself and my children,
but also for legislation that would make what they're doing to me a crime.
When the deposition started, I was pregnant again.
And I remember walking into the room.
"You're in Playboy, you have no right to privacy."
And that was a little bit shocking, but…
They would ask about my sex life.
"How am I getting questioned about my sexuality,
It made me feel like I was such a horrible woman.
I'm just a piece of meat.
They're all, "Oh, she's in Playboy, she likes being naked in public."
Playboy was empowering for me.
But in this case, it felt like a rape.
Not to bring up something really heavy from my childhood,
but when I was attacked by this guy, I thought everybody would know.
When the tape was stolen, it felt like that.
And the depositions were so brutal.
"Why do these grown men hate me so much?"
but they wanted me to come back and come back.
but I'm pregnant.
It absolutely devastated me.
But I just closed my eyes and signed the papers.
and is already available on many World Wide Web sites.
We weren't thinking about anything like that.
It really was the first viral video.
You can only sell so many fucking DVDs,
but when you open it up to the Internet, it's endless.
Really? The world's gonna see this?
to view the Anderson/Lee sex tape,
causing a cyber traffic jam on multiple websites.
And I hate when people say that we settled.
Making fun? What? What are you talking about?
I'm shocked.
Pamela Lee-- Pamela Lee and Tommy Lee
Pamela and Tommy Lee…
It was super humiliating.
-It's not funny.
It's not funny. This is devastating to us.
Well, look…
-It is? -It is!
Gotta get a clear picture.
Oh, that's pathetic.
Know my favorite part?
It was different for me than it was for him.
Tommy is a rock star.
It all adds to the image of the craziness and everything.
But I knew at that point my career was over.
-I've always loved fairy tales. -Would you wanna be a serious actress?
But had to kind of make a career out of the pieces left.
Then everything kind of blew up after that.
Yeah. I don't feel very good.
And I wanna articulate it the best I can because I… I mean, it's hard.
Sometimes you wonder why you're talking about it all again,
but, you know, it's part of what we're doing and…
In my own words.
I have romanticized the past.
So, I mean, now that we're talking about it,
Tommy comes by every day.
Tommy was so jealous.
I thought it was cute.
"I had to kiss David Chokachi, but I didn't tell Tommy."
"He came and trashed my trailer on the set."
"Put his fist through a cabinet."
"I apologized for not telling him,
lying, as he put it,
and told him it wouldn't happen again."
He would see what scene she was in.
they would change the dialogue, change the scene.
Tommy was always there.
I was working, always working.
And we had two beautiful kids, so I was busy with them.
Hi, Dylan. Happy Valentine's Day.
And I'd never spoken that way to him before.
Brandon was shaking and screaming, and holding my leg.
So I called 911, I put the receiver off.
Lee was arrested at the couple's Malibu home
a broken fingernail, and also bleeding to that hand.
The rock musician was released on half a million dollars' bail,
I… I miss my family very much
I never hit Pamela.
Uh… uh…
not cool either,
Why would you do that?
I mean, what was it about your anger that would make you lash out physically?
We've been going through a lot of stuff, sex tapes appearing, postpartum,
and two new babies.
Tommy comes third now, instead of first.
Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee was taken away in handcuffs
I'm happy that he took responsibility for this.
And I think it's the first step towards healing.
Do you think he deserves six months?
that Dylan, at six or seven weeks, was in Pamela's arms?
fate could have left you with one son instead of two.
Has that ever crossed your mind?
Afterwards, absolutely.
I have.
I apologized several times.
I mean, I have all the letters from him from jail.
Aw, picture yourself here and he had 'em all like…
Brandon, Dylan, Tommy, Pamela.
Yeah.
I'm sure I can't read these.
I mean, I had to bifurcate the divorce 'cause he wouldn't sign the papers.
"I've never loved someone so deeply."
"And by deeply, I mean, I loved his soul."
Where are we?
That's when we were living in Wayne Gretzky's house.
Oh, no way.
Hi, baby!
Terrible.
I hate that.
-Night night, baby.
Dylan. Smile, baby.
"October 11th, 1998."
"My little Dilly."
I can't see Dylan!
so one day you can read this and maybe understand
how we came to be where we are."
That I have this. This is when we first moved into the house.
Say "I'm Dilly-do."
I'm, like, all cute, and Brandon's like a little devil.
after knowing each other for four days."
"Love at first sight."
Mommy's bra.
Isn't that pretty?
"Mommy and Daddy will eventually be able to be friends, I hope."
than ever live with that abuse again."
"You will always be in a safe place."
I'm trying to sleep!
Now get out, you!
You don't talk to Mommy that way.
"Dylan, you are lying right next to me as I write this in Mommy's big bed."
"I love you so much, I'm crying."
What?
Say goodbye to Lake Tahoe.
There's only one ho in here.
"There's only one ho in here." Oh, no.
"My mom taught me the most important lesson in life."
"When you are hurt, you have two options,
to close off, become bitter,
"Love is the greatest healer."
I always gravitated towards animals.
I just felt like I could trust animals more than people.
"People always have projects for me,
And I sometimes get really caught up in being a caricature.
"I want more."
"I need more."
But I thought if I can attach it to animal activism,
So I joined forces with PETA.
This McDonald's has had meat-free burgers on its menu for a while,
Well, activism is sexy.
How's your show doing, VIP? You ever go over budget?
Yeah. Just not on my clothes or anything like that.
"Speaking of that, let's talk about…"
I don't think anyone would wear something they knew so much cruelty went into.
In London, Pamela used a book signing
to use fake fur on hats worn by the Royal Guards at Buckingham Palace.
For each autograph Pamela signed, she asked fans to return the favor
but only if they gave $250,000 to PETA.
We love you, Pam. Thank you for inviting me to do this.
It was so raunchy. It was so not my kind of humor.
But I still got to talk about things that were important to me,
so it was kind of a trade-off.
I wanted to take that and use it for good.
because this was 95% of the market
-Any relationship with North Korea?
Not yet.
…a forward-thinking compassionate move.
She wants to always use her voice for people
and animals that don't have a voice.
He's offered such an amazing and generous offer…
And it's definitely brought her into some controversial places.
Hello, Ms. Anderson. How is he?
I'd say, "The Internet's bad,"
and he'd say, "No, it's good 'cause you keep on learning everything you can."
Lying, to me, is the most damaging thing people can do to people.
For me, it's just nice to know that someone's whole life
is about truth and discovering truth.
He just believes in justice, believes in honesty,
believes in, um, exposing governments for what they're really doing,
We don't want this kind of attention anymore.
No. Like, let's just have some peace.
-How's the family? -Very good. The boys are great.
They've seen… have they seen pictures of you? Like in Playboy and stuff?
-No! -Oh.
I wasn't thinking when I was in Playboy
But I never got the chance.
You know, they always found out before I could really talk to them about it.
When I was a kid,
I would just flush with anger.
Whoa.
I remember one day after school,
Dylan coming to me in tears saying, "Mom, why did you do that tape?"
We didn't make a sex tape."
-How did that tape get out? -It was stolen.
People actually thought we put it out there for some ridiculous reason,
'cause that became kind of a trend afterward
for celebrities that were using a sex tape to become famous.
So kind of left us in that category.
And still to this day,
You could give me hundreds of millions, a billion dollars, I'd never take it.
Come on, Brandon, focus now.
and she was like, "No."
She 100% cared about her family being okay and me being okay.
Never cared about money.
She would've made millions of dollars if she just signed a piece of paper.
Instead, she sat back with nothing and watched her career, like,
fizzle into thin air.
I never get anything from Playboy. Yeah.
No.
You're a very famous person,
Yeah, that's true.
My friend David LaChapelle says I'm the least calculated person.
I'm not that person when it comes to money.
She's never worried about if she's okay.
She's always made sure everyone else is okay.
-Tommy Lee, how is he? -Great. We're like a family.
but, um, he loves his kids, and we love each other and--
There's lots of complicated reasons, right?
It wasn't always easy.
Whoo!
And never has any partner of mine liked Tommy.
It was always, like, a jealousy.
Let Bob help you.
I know how.
We moved to Detroit that point in our lives.
-Ortonville. -By the way.
-How long were we there for? -Not long.
-Yeah, we… we left pretty quick.
-Purely superficial, that's it.
-And I married Kid Rock.
my faithful partner, and my loving cowboy
Bob and I and a pineapple.
We just didn't have that height, that frenzy I was used to.
I didn't want anything less than that.
The bottom line is, you know, I…
I… Yes, I… I touched the stove.
Salomon calls.
Rick Salomon, what are you doing?
Rick Salomon.
He's a professional poker player.
And then we got married.
And he ended up being a big drug addict.
We found a crack pipe in the Christmas tree.
It wasn't me.
So we were only married a few months.
It was annulled. But we're still friends.
we decided to try it again.
It didn't last long either.
She loves getting married, you know?
and giving them good examples in their life.
Uh, tomorrow.
-It's been a while. -It has.
-How long ago was it? -How many husbands ago was it?
-Exactly.
He goes, "Baby, you're a romantic. Keep on trying."
and so I went, and…
I met a professional athlete.
He was very strong.
And he was very jealous.
if there's any abuse, or emotional abuse you don't have to stay in it.
Doesn't matter if it's your fifth marriage.
Doesn't matter what people think.
I'm attracted to these very hetero, masculine men.
or this kind of sexual thing, but I'm not the damsel in distress.
I am very capable,
and some men hate you for being something else.
and sometimes they start grabbing you by the hair and throwing you into walls,
and, like, stripping your clothes off.
It just touched some kind of weird part of a man, in my relationships anyway.
"I know your dad's an asshole, but I love him."
"Rip the Band-Aid off and just get rid of these guys
'Cause I would pick people similar, I guess, in some ways.
and maybe because of some of the relationships I had,
I didn't equate being in love with being nice, maybe.
I'm hardwired to just be, like, the most, like, loving and insane person, ever.
I go, "My mom tells me to be fearless to be in love."
They're like, "What the fuck does that even mean?"
-Means you gotta be brave to be in love. -Yeah.
-As I record this…
…before the madness starts,
happy birthday, lover.
A thousand purple balloons.
Oh my God.
Happy birthday.
I love you, baby.
To us.
Whoo!
-I can fear what's next.
So crazy. You know?
It's snowing!
It's snowing!
But I don't even remember that.
Eros is more about passion and sex and crazy.
Agape's more commitment and supportive and that kind of love,
Hello!
It's so disappointing.
Why can't we live a romantic life every day?
You look beautiful.
-Give it to me, I wanna do you. -No.
Let me do you. Please?
What up, gorgeous?
-What? -Would that be awesome, or what?
It's fucked.
Let's go for a walk.
-I love you. -I love you.
I think what it all comes down to is that
And even though I thought I could
recreate a family, or fall in love with somebody else,
So I think that's probably why I keep failing in all my relationships.
And my parents, I think, were wild and crazy,
and madly in love, and made stupid decisions,
But they stuck it out and stayed together, and I can see that they're happy now.
So I think I'd rather be alone
It's impossible to be with anybody else.
It's almost like a punishment.
Here she is after another divorce,
trying to move on with her life.
Trying to have some sort of normalcy.
But then…
New Hulu miniseries Pam and Tommy that so many people are talking about.
True story of the former couples' leaked sex tape.
that you know fucked someone up?
It really gives me nightmares.
I have no desire to watch it. Not gonna watch it.
Nobody really knows what we were going through at that time.
They should've had to have my permission.
Are you surprised it's being told now?
Nah, I'm stoked, that's cool.
as much as it did the first time."
There's no use figuring out anything about it.
The damage is done.
Why would I wanna go through that again?
I know the storm is coming.
I really don't know where I'm gonna go next, I feel restless.
How our wanting to love, our yearning for love,
I was taking a month just to kind of regroup after my divorce here.
We who love obsessively are full of fear.
Fear of being alone.
"I thought you said you retired and wanna build houses on your property in Canada."
And I was like, "I think I need a little more than that."
And, literally, just putting that out there into the universe,
Broadway called.
It's the real deal. They sent me the script, so it must be real.
Oh my God.
This is just my shoes.
Mostly my shoes.
Um, we're not gonna get crazy, we're doing classic.
These are New York.
These are Broadway.
I'm gonna wear whatever the hell I want,
and… and everyone can just suck it.
I'm not a natural singer, not a natural dancer.
"Oh my gosh. Can I do this?"
When those moments happen, run with it.
Oh, my veil!
My wedding veil.
Hmm, one of them.
Which husband?
-They're really expensive.
You know, it's okay to start something new in your fifties.
Can't believe I even said that word.
Just focus.
Have a love affair with myself.
Wake me up when there's a veggie burger in front of me.
It's like jumping on the express train when you thought it was local,
and you're like, "Oh shit, I'm missing my stop."
No move in this show is without intention.
"Oh my God! Pamela Anderson, yes!"
I probably, somewhere, in my lifetime, have tried to be Pamela Anderson.
I wanna do one more thing, which is the Mess Around, all right?
Oh, well.
Shit, you got that.
I've been messing around a long time.
I feel like it's probably the first time I'm really doing something
-Yes.
How'd you watch the first three episodes? Three episodes were last night?
They try to, like, give him reasons for stealing this shit
because Dad was an asshole and didn't pay him.
Did Dylan watch it?
Oh God, I just…
I'm like shaking.
That people think, "Oh, poor Pamela," or it's poor you, Dylan,
Okay. Well, thanks for keeping me updated, but just…
-I love you, baby. -Yeah. I love you.
Oh God.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
This is called an emotional eat.
It was a survival mechanism,
and now that it's all coming up again, I feel sick.
like you belong to the world.
Just ignore them.
You know, Roxie's favorite word.
I don't think so.
Some good stuff, Pamela.
How's it feeling?
Welcome.
Are you sure? No.
My sweet!
First freaking note.
We both reached for the gun!
But I got it first!
It's so good. I know it's exactly setting my hips up.
Okay, that burns.
-Who are you people?
If this is a dream, I'll be pissed.
This is me on Broadway.
kind of before and after a lot of the abuse in my life.
I'm really visualizing that. That we're doing this together.
That's a cold-blooded murder, Mrs. Hart. They're liable to hang you for that one.
I've always gone to a certain point and went, "That's good enough."
'cause it's the only choice.
If I care what people think, I wouldn't be here right now.
We're pushing through this, which is not a bad thing.
It's… it's… it's causing you to fight for it.
Okay.
It's out of my hands.
At the risk of complete humiliation,
Don't worry, Brandon.
You know what? This is the thing. It's gonna be an earthquake.
A volcano.

No.
You failed me, son.
No!
You left us!

Jaxxon?

Wait here.

Why?
Don't ask me why. I have no idea.

They'll pay for this.

Mom brought so much stuff like this.

They won't break up.

The announcement on that truck, right?
I've already made plans with Mark.
-Then I'm going with you guys too. -Can we go together later?
I want to go with just Mark.
It's my first date.
Nothing special. Just what I normally eat.
My granddaughters come to visit…
FERRIS WHEEL
Okay.
-Really? -But you shoot it.
-Won't you play? -I don't know how.
Try it. Just try.
I don't know how. You shoot, Mark.
Try it.
Can I speak to Toh, please?
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Wow, bullseye!
You're great.
Here.
Thank you.
Hey, you're an expert at wrapping now.
Teach me some time.
Me.
Let's go.
Hurry!
Come on!
Yesterday they were already open.
It's almost 5:00 p.m. Why hasn't the fair opened?
The fair ended yesterday.
They're already taking things down.
Here.
I'm giving you the half with the yolk.
Let's go.
Where?
There's no one here.
C'mon. I'll show you something.
KRASUE SHOW
How was it?
Try imagining along with me.
Try getting closer.
Boo!
I'll show you more.
And right here, there were lots of people dancing.
The flower pot crackers were beautiful.
I wished we saw them together.
Oh, and did you ride the carousel?
Yup.
But they weren't horses.
I have something to tell you.
Can we go steady?
I was sitting on the carousel,
but it felt like
I'm jealous.
Me, can I be Mark's girlfriend?
Come on, Me.
Me.
Yesterday, you didn't even invite me.
Not even a single word.
Then
from now on,
let's go out altogether as three.
I won't leave you out, ever.
I promise.
<i>I won't forget the happiness</i>
<i>we once had together</i>
<i>No matter</i>
<i>who else I meet in this life</i>
<i>I will always have you</i>
<i>kept in my heart</i>
<i>I'll save it</i>
<i>and only you</i>
It's not like you play it any better!
Gosh, it's so hard.
Well, it's scary.
Sure. Bring it on.
Take it easy.
Just wait and see.
Okay.
That's right.
Me, you can do it now.
Oh, what happened?
A leaf.
It's sweet.
The only difference between you two
is that Me has a mole
but You doesn't. That's it?
Our height, weight,
clothes and shoe sizes are all exactly the same.
How so?
Isn't You stubborn?
You?
You is serious
She's somewhat stubborn,
but silently stubborn.
While Me…
you are openly stubborn
and like a gangster.
Yeah?
We just met but it's like
you are You's twin
so we clicked faster.
I don't feel that we're close. Is it all in your head?
Oh?
I'm leaving.
I'm fine.
Careful, stubborn girl!
I'll ride you home myself. Get on, kiddos.
Mark, hold on tight.
Hey!
Wait… Whoa!
Me, drive carefully!
I'm sorry.
Go ahead first.
Here, take this.
Well, yeah.
Shall we…
try kissing?
Right here?
Everyone's inside already. No one will see.
Mark, why do you like me?
That question is embarrassing.
Not as much as what we just did.
Because you're kind.
The day we had the re-test,
you let me copy your test.
It totally impressed an idiot like me.
I liked you since that day.
you're quiet.
Do you remember?
And… do you feel the same?
Aren't you going to wash up?
I'm too lazy.
I'll go first then.
So?
What did you talk to Mark about?
Nothing. Just stuff.
I'm going to wash up.
<i>Sol.</i>
Sol. Fa.
You.
Help me.
Hey, what's with your hair?
I just felt like it.
My hair, my business.
It's not like you tell me everything.
La.
Sol. Do.
La.
Okay, two more times.
Yeah, I'm just here for kicks. Can't I?
I'm not complaining.
Hey! Don't you cut my chances.
The best man should win.
I'm older than you.
Love has nothing to do with age.
If you want to know, open up your heart.
Hey, that's a good line.
We're awesome!
He's good-looking too.
Here.
and his picture too.
Isn't he fine?
His name's Toh.
Just wait for me to grow up.
I don't wanna brag,
I'll be ten times more handsome.
Play that song for me.
Hey, listen.
<i>Oh Me, I've never loved anyone</i> <i>as much as Me</i>
<i>Because Me makes my heart fluttered</i>
<i>All of my heart belongs to Me</i>
<i>For all my life, I will love only Me</i>
I'm not sleepy anymore.
I just knew that you are Toh's girlfriend.
No!
I was just teasing the kids.
Oh.
What? Were you eavesdropping?
No way!
I wasn't eavesdropping.
You were talking so loud.
If he's not your boyfriend,
are you dating him?
Yeah.
Really?
Is there something?
Well…
There's something about him I don't like.
He's conceited.
Or is it because he's cooler than you?
Whoa.
Your words…
are harsh.
Hey, I was teasing you.
Fine then, I don't like Toh anymore.
Okay?
That's your business.
Me.
Recently, Granny's been complaining to me that hiring you isn't worth it.
You're not really helping at the shop
since you're always out with us.
"Us"?
Yeah.
Stay and help Granny with the shop.
Fine, I admit.
I just want some alone time with Mark.
You understand me, right?
What's with the sarcasm?
You, Me.
The meteor shower is starting!
Come on.
I don't know.
Look at that one.
Wow.
What day?
Only two months?
Yeah.
From the first day I started phin lessons.
Well, what about the re-test day? Doesn't that count?
Hey, Mark.
You never know, the person you like might be me.
What's the use of saying that?
It's just for laughs. Why so serious?
It's the truth!
Mark!
Damn you.
Just go away!
I wish I wasn't born as your twin.
{\an8}Promise me,
<i>So, is this what you really want, Nim?</i>
Yeah.
Hello, Mark.
Hello, Mark.
It's You.
<i>I'll bring the girls</i> <i>to live with Mom here.</i>
<i>Wait, they're my kids as well.</i>
<i>Be reasonable, will you?</i>
<i>How can you raise both kids?</i> <i>Do you have enough money?</i>
<i>You speak like you have money.</i>
<i>Well, I have more than you, okay?</i>
<i>I'll get the job soon.</i>
<i>-Let one of the girls live with me.</i> <i>-Are you crazy?</i>
<i>They won't agree to it.</i>
<i>So, what do you want?</i>
<i>You want them to tough it out with you?</i>
<i>Don't you think that's a bit selfish?</i>
<i>Think about their future.</i>
<i>So, what's your decision?</i>
<i>And if they agree,</i>
<i>Well, try talking with them first then.</i>
<i>Let's talk when I get to Bangkok tomorrow.</i>
Me, I'm going to Bangkok.
I'm You, not Me!
{\an8}CLOSED
Why didn't Mark come to teach?
Why don't you know?
Didn't Mark tell you?
I don't know.
That's why he didn't call you.
Stop asking already!
Yeah…
Excellent.
All right, next person.
Yeah, just sit there. Okay.
You can start
whenever you're ready.
You can get in now.
NAKHON PHANOM NA KAE
CHAO POR MUEN SHRINE NAKHON PATHOM
Please don't break up with You.
I'm so confused right now.
Who do I really like?
I'm sorry.
What are your feelings towards me?
I don't know.
You don't?
Then why did you tell me you'd stop liking Toh?
Well, I don't know.
You don't even know either.
I've lived with You all my life.
And then you came into our lives.
or I'm just jealous of You.
I really don't know.
Or should we try going out together…
just the two of us?
So, we'd totally know how we feel?
And then what?
If I really do like you…
what about You?
I don't know.
Yesterday I heard Dad talking with Mom.
Really?
That's why she went to Bangkok, right?
They might divorce.
Really?
And…
As for me,
-I'll have to go live with Dad. -Hey! That's not right.
How could they do this?
They didn't even ask us first.
I won't accept it. I'm going to go talk with them.
Including Mom…
and Mark.
that Mark liked you first.
And you didn't think of telling me?
Why, You?
From now on,
can you stop messing with Mark?
Why, You?
MERRY CHRISTMAS, NOW SHOWING
Sorry, I'm late.
NOW SHOWING
<i>I want to be with you.</i>
<i>It's no use. Everyone hates you.</i>
<i>Just go back.</i>
<i>No, I have to tell you something.</i>
<i>Why…</i>
Wanna try kissing?
So, you'll know how you feel.
<i>And I'm here</i> <i>because everyone made me happy.</i>
<i>Everyone here is sincere.</i>
It's You, right?
Why are you doing this?
Answer me!
Using this guise?
Asking Me out behind my back
makes you an asshole too!
The two of you should stop messing with me.
CLOSED
ME, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. I'M GOING BACK TO DAD.
Here, your steamed bun.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Oh, this bus?
Are you okay?
Here, drink some water first.

All right, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.

She must have drugged you,
then stole your bag and boarded the bus.
That's why the officer mistook her for you.

WAREE'S SHOP GIFT WRAPPING SERVICE
<i>It's a short school break</i>
<i>that I will never forget.</i>
<i>Let's keep in touch!</i>
<i>Mark</i>
{\an8}TO YOU AND ME FROM MARK
Right now we're at Korat, Mom.
We stopped at a gas station.
We already knew that
you and Dad are splitting.
Will you let us choose who we want to live with?
PICK UP HERE
Here.
PAD
Me.
Huh?
If we live with Mom,
It'd probably be like this school break
BANGKOK NAKHON PHANOM
that Dad's disappeared.
Do you think…
we'll become distant with Dad one day?
But if we live with Dad,
we'd live in the same house,
study at the same school,
And only get to see Mom during the school break.
When we grow older
Do you think
if we chose one,
and they simply say, "I'm fine."
because we aren't living in their world anymore.
Then what should we do?
<i>because they're worried</i> <i>about Y2K problems.</i>
<i>because it is safer.</i>
<i>Moreover…</i>
You! Me!
If you're done, bring me the tape.
Okay!
<i>As for petrol stations, it's reported that</i>
-I'll go. <i>-lots of cars</i>
<i>in the chance upon entering 2000</i>
<i>and a disaster may happen.</i>
No matter what, I still have to move in with Granny.
Help me hold it.
Why did you choose Me,
and not me?
I overheard what you were talking to Dad about.
I'm sorry, honey.
The reason I wanted you to live with Dad
is you are more mature.
You can take care of yourself.
You can also take care of Dad.
Hurry up before Me eats it all.
I have a New Year's gift for you.
So you can call me when you're with Mom.
You.
Me.
I'm sorry
for not being able to keep our family together.
I tried my best.
Please don't be mad at me.
Go live with Mom, okay?
Dad.
If the world doesn't end tonight,
We've already made a decision.
Me will live with Mom.
And I'll live with you, Dad.
Bangkok now has a sky train.
I want to take it to school.
There isn't one where Granny lives.
As for me,
I'm the best gift wrapper, you know?
Is this what you two really want?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Thanks so much, girls.
Buy me another mobile phone, Dad.
Of course.
Come over here.
Look at you with all these tears, what a mess.
Don't cry.
I don't know.
I think so.
But it's not something out of this world.
It's just…
And don't forget to fill me in about Dad too.
<i>All right, everyone.</i>
<i>the year 2000.</i>
<i>Are you all ready?</i>
I don't know.
But I'm not afraid anymore.
Yeah. Same here.
<i>Eight…</i>
<i>Seven…</i>
<i>Six…</i>
<i>Five…</i>
<i>Four…</i>
<i>Three…</i>
<i>Two…</i>
I was so busy that I completely forgot about time.

Today Jialu's hairpin suddenly appeared in my pocket
What do you think
Will she have a chance here?
Is Jialu here?
Jialu is here?
Did you see Jialu when you were searching online?
no
I came to this place
The first thing I saw was Jialu
Then there are hairpins
Then there was her call

I'll try to find her for you
No, I don’t want to miss it again
If Jialu is really here
She will do it before the pentagram burns out
give us instructions
Will she call again?
possible
Kill and fill your life!
Awu will definitely kill you!
Die!
Drink it!
Die!
sorry

Why?
I shouldn't give you false hope
Stupid?
You don't want it either
but i don't understand
She must have something to say to you
Otherwise why would I call you?
What do you think she wanted to say to me?
Just want to tell you
Don't drink anymore
This wine bottle was given to me by her
knew
no
I didn't mean to say this
I want to say
In fact, in my heart
at least
You have a hairpin and a wine flask
but me
I don't have anything
I have nothing to prove...
My daughter really existed
nothing happened
I destroyed her
So, the memories between you
I see
Thank you Galu
three plans
The first plan, plan A
We walked to the pier
We are fully equipped
Then put the tent here
If it's a boat
Then they'll stop, right?
I have some doubts about this too
I noted the wolf smoke
But don't laugh first
Forget it and ignore it
Plan B
Actually, I thought this was the best.
if you are still afraid
I'll chat with you
Sleep until dawn
But there is one drawback
You are only anxious now
Look at the mess you've made now
Admit it
You need someone to take care of you
You have albinism, you have amblyopia
But you are not brainless
Be more mature, okay?
What are you stirring up?
Hello, sorry
Come here!
don't want!
Let go!
Let’s go!

Escape there!
Mom, let's play hide and seek together

Daughter! daughter…

Wine and vegetables
Poor greeting, drink cup, drink cup
Everyone
Today’s Awu’s marriage

Finally, Abba takes revenge on the villagers
Poison everyone in the village with poisonous wine
And Awu...
Want his soul...
Never reincarnate
not my words
it's not your fault
No one wants to be like this
I know
But I still can't forgive myself
Me too
I can't forgive myself either

We also don’t dare to face it
the most important is
Maybe something brought me to this place

Let me out...

Once she caught a grasshopper
The grasshopper flew away secretly

So tired that I fell asleep on the bed
Who knows, as soon as I open my eyes early in the morning
The whole bed was also made of grasshoppers by you.
Abba
I remember

Silly daughter
Abba didn’t protect you well
Abba

If you really love Xi’s father

Let's go...
Hello…
Hello…
Jiahao
Haotian…
Hello…
Haotian
Are you scared?
Our whole village…
I'll kill you
I also learn from you
no difference
What do you want?
if i die
don't want!
You've killed all my friends
What else do you want?
I want…
his life
<i>This is Conrad.</i>
<i>he's about to break</i>
<i>I'm Will, by the way, Conrad's best friend.</i>
<i>Let's not even talk about his sock drawer</i>
<i>or his five different toothbrushes</i>
<i>or the long list of librarians, proofreaders,</i>
<i>because you see, today,</i>
<i>Conrad's compulsive routine meets its match.</i>
<i>Oh, shoot! I gotta go.</i>
<i>That's Conrad's boss Frank coming in.</i>
Late, and you're using my oven.
Sorry, Frank. I got here early and lost track of time...
Yeah, if Regina sees those piece of crap popovers,
you'll be looking for your next paycheck elsewhere.
Now, next door, pick this up.
I need the mushroom powder in ten minutes
before Regina gets here, or. you're a dead man.
Nine minutes 50 seconds, you're still here.
I need a steamed almond milk latte,
with a teaspoon of cinnamon and milk,
and a half packet of sugar, but brown sugar,
and several pumps of vanilla.
Oh, and a few more things.
A tall flat white...
And, then a medium flat white, a caramel macchiato,
and I think it's a regular coffee,
it just says "R COFFEE".
No, no, no, no, you know. Totally, what's this?
I have a long line and you're falling on my counter
Hi. Yes, no.
Frank needs a carton of heavy cream and.
.That powder thing.
What powder thing?
Ah, yes. That.
What does that say?
Excuse me, Mr. Conrad,
can't you just call Frank whoever and ask him?
Yeah, and can you do it today,
because we have people who have places to go.
Dude, hurry up.
It says Lion's Mane Mushroom Powder,
That's not a mushroom.
It's not?
Of course, that's the powder he wants.
It didn't say unicorn's mane.
15 dollars for the cream,
I hope you're right.
I'm always right.
Oh, I. really like your confidence.
I noticed.
And I have to have confidence. I'm an influencer.
You don't say?
that I'm better than they are, that I know everything,
and that they absolutely have to have what I'm pimping.
when I get back to work just to...
Confirm that I'm not fired.
Give me your phone.
with your own personal electronic device.
Otherwise, that kinda makes you a butthole, dude.
You know, you're kind of bossy.
And you're kind of running out of time.
And you're holding up the line.
her Happy Sparkle latte in T-5 minutes.
Yeah, don't let this polka-dot dress fool you.
I'm a ninja.
Hi, Conrad, I'm Molly.
Tell your eccentric boss, you're welcome.
Oh, no! That's it. You're done.
One more scratch, and it's weed-killer for you.
Man, ten years.
Ten years I've been fighting this losing battle.
Hey, Tommy, I have something Frank asked me to get.
Kid.
And now, for Conrad's famous secret specialty.
You better not be using steel wool
Sorry, guys, I can just put it in the dishwasher.
Okay, I'm certainly attached to my finger so.
I'm kind of attached to them too.
Delish.
You get my powder, you Boy-O?
- Yeah, yeah. - Move.
There was this girl in line, she said she was always right.
Look at this.
Oh god, Tommy.
That's good luck, right? Take it out.
That's it?
Just that cost you 100 smackers?
Tommy, you done out there yet?
No, I'm not done yet.
It was 85 for the powder, and 15 for the cream.
That's highway robbery. That's highway robbery!
It's fine. It's good, it's fine.
This is really good stuff. It's okay.
Who knew fungi was so expensive?
That's a whole monster rabbit hole for another time.
This stuff, this stuff, Frank, is medicinal.
Go get the mop, Conny boy. Santo had another accident.
Medicinal, really?
Yeah, it's medicinal.
Find yourself in California..
You never would've ordered this crap
This is a restaurant.
You were right about the powder.
But it's not food.
You're a grouch.
A girl never reveals her secret.
He's not bothering you, Molly?
Need me to rough him up?
I'm good, Hal, but thank you.
Why does everyone keep threatening me, anyway?
Because you're pretty and they're jealous?
Molly's my favorite, she comes here every day.
So, what kind of influencer are you?
Beauty products.
They sent me new products to try out,
And that pays your bills?
Restaurant boy. So what's that all about?
I love to cook.
Uh-huh. You want to be impulsive?
- Wait, only one fish? - You drive.
Come on.
It's beautiful.
It certainly is.
I don't think I've been here before.
What? Oh!
Hi! I'm Molly, and I want a pretzel, please.
Perfectly salted pretzel for a perfect little lady.
You're lucky that I didn't drink milk growing up.
You know, it was, so nice to meet you.
Cash.
Sorry.
Ketchup with a pretzel?
It's not?
Even that guy over there agreed with me.
It's bread, isn't it?
Who cares?
I mean, everyone knows that pretzels go with mustard,
not with ketchup.
You need to expand your mind.
and asked for an easy-bake oven
when the other boys wanted crossbows
What did you want to be before Gordon Ramsay?
Paul McCartney.
A good chef is also a rock star.
So, it stands to reason you made a lateral move.
Duly noted. Let's move to the boat.
The boat?
Come on.
All aboard.
Fine, then stay out there.
Okay, uh...
It brings back bad childhood memories.
You drive a hard bargain.
I could show you.
I can make you dinner sometime this week,
tomorrow, tonight?
What, you're on Twitch?
Right? It's been Five for like a decade.
Right?
Crap, you're right.
They must have drugged my pretzel.
No, it's the ketchup.
You made the pretzel Gods angry.
I like Pinot Noir and I'm a vegetarian.
Even though I like red things.
I like seafood too.
Pescatarian. We just sat in a fish.
It's just easier to say vegetarian
then add the fish part.
<i>A ferret on a leash?</i>
The craziest thing I've ever seen.
What?
- Nothing. - No, what's so funny?
Nothing.
What's so funny? Come on.
No, no, no. That was... that was the door.
Um, no.
I am so embarrassed.
Look, please don't make that my nickname.
Toot Toot late.
No, no, no. It's fine.
It means you're human.
Bye.
Every table in the goddamn restaurant
before you get this one.
Very sloppy.
Very sloppy. Geez.
How was your date yesterday?
Good, I think.
That's kind of personal, right?
because then, I will never be happy for you.
I want to cook her dinner.
I was gonna make the crab cake dish.
I will not be held responsible if she dies
because you screwed up my recipe.
I'll give you a teaspoon of the mushroom powder.
What?
for a little jar this big, and you're giving it to him?
Hey, what's up, Will?
<i>Gonna say, what's up.</i>
You're in Liverpool?
<i>I'm so jealous.</i>
<i>Wait. Isn't it like 4 AM there?</i>
Are you brushing your teeth?
<i>with five different toothbrushes?</i>
<i>Whatever.</i>
Listen, I'm about to hit up Strawberry Fields too, bro.
<i>That's cool, but, look,</i>
Sex is better than McCartney.
<i>Sex is better than the Beatles, huh?</i>
- Yeah. - All right, man. Later.
All right, mate, good luck. Hope you find another singer.
It doesn't need to be perfect.
Yes, it does.
This is Frank's specialty.
Now, I... I don't normally cook for...
Girls?
Human beings?
I... there was...
All right.
You know, I really like your dress.
I guess?
Continue, my child.
Well, that seems to be a theme with you.
and I don't even remember doing it.
They just show up in my closet.
Oh, well, let's eat.
This looks amazing.
Crabcake sans green.
Sorry.
It's. not bad.
No, it's shit.
Yeah, it's shit.
Oh god, yes.
Sorry I jacked it up.
Yeah. Well, I probably put in too much coconut and lemon.
or off or something too.
Actually, it was chicken broth.
You know, I thought I had vegetable,
but I didn't, so I substituted.
You did what now? Chicken broth!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize someone was already sitting here.
What?
The table! I didn't know it was already spoken for.
I'll move.
No, look. I'm sorry about the food.
Anything?
Yes.
I don't even know you. But you're cute.
So, thank you. Hi. I'm Vanessa.
What's that?
My name is Vanessa, and the mystery man
who wants to buy a stranger dinner is?
Ah-ha! Role-play. All right, being impulsive.
You're from the South, I take it?
Oklahoma.
I'm. I'm a famous chef.
I just work part time at an animal shelter.
Come on, you can do better than that.
As a job?
but it's a starting off point.
I'm taking online courses. I'll have the steak.
Veterinarian, yes, vegetarian no.
I love my meat. What?
It's not like I'd eat my patients.
Well, this is fun. Let's do this again.
Yeah.
<i>but not my boy Conrad.</i>
<i>for a walk in the park the next day</i>
<i>like he's in some damn Jane Austen novel.</i>
Oh. Cook for me sometime?
I play acoustic guitar.
with my best friend Will.
I once wanted to be in music too. But.
You're a good guy, Conrad. I feel really safe around you.
You hungry?
Yes. But not for food.
Yours?
I just love this bed.
You do?
Vanessa, are you okay?
Molly?
Nope, I'm Silk.
Not my bra, dummy. That's my name, bitch.
Wait, your name is Silk?
Right, so not even close to either of those
How did you get me to come home with you?
That's my kryptonite.
I'm also in a rock band.
Otherwise, where's the fun?
with a heart posted on it from your mom
Your mom must be freakin' psychic.
She get you this crappy bed too?
I have rehearsal. What! But, I don't, hey...
Look, umm.
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, sure.
I'll come see you at the Federal.
You know I'm a musician too, right?
That's part of the fun, hon. You gotta figure it out. Bye!
Silk! No, no, hey, hey! You can't do this.
Oh, look who decided to show up.
Sorry, I got a little...
What is her sister's name, Polyester?
under the stairwell. Yeah, how'd you miss those?
Steel wool? Your shoe's untied.
That never gets old.
God, I love that woman.
She scares me.
This, uh, this Silk chick, she's off the list.
And put the damn stuff away.
<i>I'm telling you.</i>
<i>I don't care, let him start from the beginning.</i>
<i>Want to try again with those crab cakes?</i>
Sure, Molly, tonight?
Oh crap, don't choke, please.
If you say bone marrow.
Lion's Mane Mushroom powder.
Your boss let you use it?
He knows it's a special dinner for a special lady.
Aww, that's so sweet.
So, how's blogging?
Aww! It's not blogging. It's live streaming.
like tomorrow?
Oh God, no, I don't take charity, from anyone.
Apparently. Even some toaster that's just for marshmallows.
I feel you should put a surveillance camera
Maybe.
Those buggers are quick, man,
and they bite if they're provoked.
Wait, he is never up this early.
Hang on a second.
Yo, Kill Will. What's up? Everything okay?
<i>Dude, I'm back in town for a while.</i>
Oh. Holy hell!
Hey, bitch, I told you I'm playing
at the Federal tonight, it's Saturday.
for flawed attitude. 9 PM. See you there, dork.
I guess I'm going to a concert.
Where's your VIP wristband?
Hey Mason, is this guy with you?
Friend of Silk's.
Come with me.
I'm so sorry!
Hey, bitch.
Who's this bum?
Conrad. Conrad, my gangster manager Jimbo.
Hi, how's it going?
I'm still getting ready, but stand in the front
where I can see you.
Wait up for me afterwards, asshole.
So, how do you know Silk?
I met her not that long ago. How do you know her?
Shit, I have known Silk for years, man.
so when she decides to surface, we do a gig. Here we are.
What successful rock musician does?
Yeah, I know. I've met a few.
Yes, I've lost count on how many I've met.
You know, I play guitar too.
All right, man, so this is the green room,
You should've come to Ibiza, man.
It was wild, man.
No, duh, Will.
You're a chef, can't you like whip some of that up?
Oh, thank you.
Probably could've gotten you a touring musician gig.
You showed me how lucrative a music career was.
That's what killed the dream.
you couldn't handle anyone else packing up your gear
without the label facing front.
Okay, that is totally not true.
It's a guitar case, Conrad.
It's called being a touring musician, Conrad.
So who was playing tonight?
She was actually really good.
Yeah?
Oh, okay, so she was good.
So how long is this one going to last?
A month?
they rearrange my action figures.
Not this time, alright. She's different.
like a 60-year-old woman?
Thank you.
You two handsome boys need anything else?
No. We're good.
I'm Kristen.
Holler if you need me.
Yeah, that was stupid.
What about Jan?
Oh, Jan and I are splitsville.
Yeah. She just didn't get me at all.
She's the one we're replacing in the band.
Oh, okay.
for squeezing the end of the toothpaste wrong?
And.
Well, she kind of has multiple personalities.
Yes, what woman doesn't?
No, I'm serious.
Like I thought it was role-playing at first,
from when she's someone else.
I just never know when she's going to switch.
Okay, this can get really dark, really fast.
One second she wanted to have sex,
the next, she wanted to blowtorch me.
With an actual blowtorch.
I don't feel like it's my place really.
It's not your place?
Uh-uh. You don't mess with people like that.
Okay, yeah. I'll ask her at the party tomorrow.
Good.
Thanks.
Asshole.
<i>A rocker pool party, and I wasn't invited?</i>
Hell, yes.
<i>But Conrad was on a mission,</i>
<i>and I suppose that's more important than free booze</i>
<i>and potentially seeing scantily clad women.</i>
<i>You gotta show what you got.</i>
<i>Some kind of vampire rocker?</i>
Hey, dork!
Want some tequila?
Dude, you're so weird, it's alcohol.
Hi, I'm Anya, nice to meet you.
Anya is my girlfriend.
Let me guess, you're a basketball player.
So is this really her house?
She's been hurt before.
When she's depressed or manic, she cycles more.
I met her as Sarah.
Wait, who is Sarah?
Her Aussie Lesbian alter.
We dated for a hot second,
An Aussie, huh?
Pretty sexy.
She's literally my favorite girlfriend ever.
I mean it. Yeah. Well, remember,
my girl's a basketball player,
and I'm a ninja.
Are you okay?
Silk? Silk?
Are you okay?
You're wasting your breath, mate.
I'm a lesbian.
Uh, let me start with, I'm Conrad.
so hi, I'm Sarah.
so wonder if I could ask your advice about a girl.
All right.
Well, great.
Far out, you millennials. Here, take a sip.
That's. actually not bad. For an old-der person's drink.
Okay, so. This chick.
This girl, woman.
She's like a roller coaster, and I don't know why.
I feel like there's so much about her I don't know.
I'd like to.
I'm usually the guy that walks out the door,
When I was in my 30s, which was decades ago,
I thought I was in love once too.
If you're wondering how she's feeling,
so stop being a piss pot and get it together.
I get that, but what if she still gets defensive
and won't talk to me?
I'm not abandoning her.
Also, she's actually really hot
so maybe we could do a threesome sometime.
You never know. For the right lady.
<i>Now he said she switched at the party</i>
<i>to avoid a discussion.</i>
<i>I reminded him again about the blowtorch,</i>
We're almost done here, sugar.
Hope you brought your appetite.
Jazz.
Just a moment.
Had this forever.
Let's find out.
You're good.
You said you're from Oklahoma but then.
Um, no, but listen, I really wanted to
talk to you about this so...
Let's be impulsive now.
Did I forget something?
Hey.
<i>Hey. I'm sorry to bother you so late,</i>
<i>but I just.</i>
I miss you too. Molly?
Yes. I've got some time before work.
<i>Molly? Molly?</i>
<i>The door was unlocked, so I let myself in.</i>
Are you okay? Is everything okay?
With work, home?
I haven't really asked you much about home.
There's nothing really to talk about.
I just wanted you here.
I needed to feel safe.
Even if it's uh,
you want me to wear your underwear.
Would you?
Just don't asked me to wear lipstick,
Hey, what's with the number seven?
You have a lot of them.
I'm obsessed with the number, Toot.
Yeah, of course.
<i>So he arranged to meet them at their favorite spot.</i>
Coffee bombing, huh?
Usually that's not a good sign.
Can I get you something?
Sit down.
Molly, I need to talk to you about something.
No.
Oh my God, no. No. No. But I haven't been fair to you.
Are you cheating on me?
Yes. No. I mean, no.
How you look at it?
It's complicated.
The others?
How the hell would I know about your other women?
No, about your others?
Oh, you think I'm cheating on you?
Who?
and how they come out at various random times
but thankfully, they all seem to like me,
What?
Say another word to her about the other parts.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Molly doesn't know about Vanessa, Silk, and Sarah.
Neither do they about her.
And what are you?
I keep her safe. I keep them all safe.
Not to share.
You care about these girls?
Keep Your mouth shut.
Bring this up again, and we're gone.
Do we understand each other?
<i>You always know where she is.</i>
taking advantage of my generosity.
What?
The mushroom powder.
And I wanted to try it again, but I spilled it.
with another girl.
At least as far as I know.
Five?
Yes but the thing is, they're all the same girl,
and none of them know about each other.
Actually, she didn't threaten that,
it was horrifying.
Take off your apron and get outside.
Now.
Take it off!
Sit down.
Am I fired?
To be a chef.
You know, you're a lot easier to talk to than Frank.
I think he hates me.
He always has been.
And she wants to sleep with literally everyone but him.
Including you.
Yeah.
he works in people with head problems.
I think you and your girl, you should talk with him.
I don't think she'd be receptive.
Tell her it's about something else.
Paul does hypnotherapy for parties and stuff all the time.
It feels slightly dishonest, but okay.
Okay.
Good.
Tommy said great things about you.
Thanks for coming over. Is it Doctor or Paul?
Paul. Paul is fine.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, she has a shopping addiction thing so.
Oh, just right here.
I think you'll love it.
Molly, hi. This is Paul.
He can, um, hypnotize people.
I thought maybe it was something we could try
for, you know, your shopping addiction.
I know you like to be spontaneous
and try new things and stuff.
Oh really?
I think it could be fun.
I'm in. Just don't make it worse.
All right. Here comes the fun part.
Okay.
Just close your eyes.
That's right.
and when you reach 1,
And you're going to answer whatever questions I ask you.
Count backwards from 10.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three.
Very good.
Yes.
I'm not Molly.
I'm sorry, who are you?
There's somebody else here.
Who?
Vanessa.
Is she dissociating?
Is she what?
Vanessa, welcome. I'm glad you're here.
I'm not Vanessa.
Who am I talking to now?
Sarah.
What?
Dissociative identity disorder. Multiple personalities.
It's not safe.
Sarah. Sarah, it's okay. It's all right.
You're safe. Sarah?
This isn't Sarah.
- You are? - Silk.
But it's not just me.
You're going to need more chairs, man.
I know what your little game here is, Conrad,
Bite me.
I will not be disrespected by you, Rita.
I'm going to shut this down.
No. No.
No.
Please don't, don't leave yet.
My name is Paul Forrester and I'm a psychologist.
I'm here to help you.
I can't talk to you. She doesn't want me to.
It was him.
Who?
He did it.
Who?
Papa.
Does anybody else know about this?
No.
Yes. Because I love him.
Silk, do you know Molly, Vanessa, Rita, and Sarah?
Please don't erase us.
No. I won't erase you.
<i>I just do these parlor tricks</i>
<i>on the side for fun for friends.</i>
<i>That is not what this woman needs.</i>
You tricked me.
You brought someone in here and made me think I'm crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
I mean, maybe a little challenged
at staying as one person, I mean, alter all the time.
Bullshit!
I don't have DID, I'm not a freak.
Nothing's wrong with me.
Break up with you? Yup, accurate. Goodbye, Conrad.
<i>Hell no.</i>
<i>Even with the best intentions,</i>
<i>you don't mess with people like that.</i>
<i>Hey Instagram,</i> <i>oh</i>, <i>look at the little puppy.</i>
Oh, dogged on Instagram.
<i>Hi, friends.</i>
<i>Oh, look, snickerdoodle coffee the bestest.</i>
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
You said I couldn't call you.
But I know you like your snickerdoodle flavored coffee.
Right on the door.
I know he likes his gourmet coffee.
I'm sorry?
Oh, no.
She dumped me.
Hey, you never told me about the dish.
Crabcakes.
How'd they come out?
Oh, Molly said they were good.
After she was done fake choking and giving me a heart attack.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you stay late today? Make it for me.
Yeah.
Oh. kid.
Kid.
I mean, this is almost.
What?
Yes, I win.
Now, listen. Don't get cocky, but how about tomorrow night,
What about Frank?
He'll live, he's a big boy. Talent is talent.
End of story.
Why is he helping me?
Try this.
Come on, try it.
Come on. Try it.
Your boy did good.
What is steel wool still doing here?
Frank, come on. Come in here, try this. Hurry up.
Frank.
Frank.
Don't even think about it.
Now clock out so you stop costing us money.
I just love that walk.
What?
Have you ever told her how you feel?
Regina.
She'd never go for a guy like me.
She could have any guy she wants.
No. Oh God no, I would never...
Maybe, but if she turns me down, you're a dead man.
Fair enough.
<i>Inspired by his advice to Frank,</i>
Hey. Molly.
Oh, the humanity.
Wow, that was actually cringeworthy!
Can you call 911
You know, better yet, call the cops
because I'd like to report a murder.
You know, I'm lactose intolerant,
That was good.
There is nothing like good singing.
Thank you, Hal.
<i>try to play your way out of it.</i>
Not bad. Not bad.
All right, it was pretty weak,
You are just full of encouragement.
Look.
back into one thingy, who would you pick?
No. Of the 5, 6, 7 person... Whatever,
They're actually all really cool.
Even the lesbian.
Yeah.
Have you ever asked about a threesome?
Actually.
That would be a horrible insensitive joke, Conrad.
you gotta be okay with that one.
Yeah, I know.
Dude, of all the women that I've seen you date
out of the box and started playing with it.
Dude, you ever think maybe it's you?
I realize I have some work to do too.
Damn, dude.
I never thought I'd hear you say that.
I'm proud of you, man.
Show me somethin' better.
Whatever, man, whatever that was.
Come in. Sit down.
So, how can I help you?
I'm sorry. I.
I was trying to be supportive. I just want to understand her.
Is. Silk the real her?
just being okay with that, and other times,
it's a matter of wanting to fuse the personalities,
all of the personalities and their memories into one.
What do you think?
The fact that she introduced herself by name
as the alternates
means that she trusts you and she cares about you.
In an odd sense, yes.
I want to help her.
So why don't we start there?
you could spare them a room for the night.
Please stop, Conrad.
Nice job, asshole.
If only she could see what I can see.
She can. She can.
Something I felt you could use.
Should I get a restraining order?
Since you keep showing up.
Look, please just take it.
out my window at you.
Great idea. Super thoughtful. Okay, fine.
You know what, you win.
but I refuse to keep torturing myself.
Spark on!
Hi, I'm Molly. And this is me. Recording.
<i>Don't forget to erase this in the morning.</i>
Please.
This is called a deep dish, Boy-O.
But I do like a deep dish ass.
Come on, Conrad, sing with me.
Forget the singing, back to pizza.
Nice work, steel wool.
<i>I'm so sorry, Conrad. You were right.</i>
<i>Can we talk?</i>
New assistant chef, starting next week.
Yes!
I did it, Conrad.
<i>Don't forget to erase this in the morning.</i>
All the unaccounted-for time, shopping,
now it all makes sense.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I started seeing him yesterday.
I'm sorry.
Molly and Sarah tell you you're hard-core.
Spirits?
That's what they put in cocktails in Europe.
I've been away too long.
Actually thought she was possessed for a minute.
I just hoped I haven't make things worse.
No, man. You did the right thing.
and just blast my damn magical armor?
All right, coat myself in fairy dust
and eat a long sword mofo.
She's been seeing Paul for a few weeks now, so maybe.
Yeah.
Agh! Killed by a slap of gold, the story of my life.
They're not called the real one, they hate that.
Right.
Yes. Next level.
Well, if she's as talented as you say,
maybe when she's on the straight and narrow,
she can come play with us.
I only have two controllers, I need to get another one.
Oh, I get it. I failed my audition.
at the restaurant, be grateful.
Staying in lousy hotels, no sleep, bad for relationships.
So many of us are never that.
It's my first day as assistant chef.
Okay.
Will never turn down free food, let's go.
Got it.
<i>But Conrad assured me she'd been doing great.</i>
<i>However, nothing could have prepared me for that dinner.</i>
Congratulations on your first time cooking with Regina.
I hope we all survive.
Will, this is Molly.
I thought I was meeting Silk.
Well, Silk was here but then she...
Who's this bitch?
Who the hell are you? Hi, I'm Will.
Silk. Pleasure to meet you, jerk-off.
I hear you are in a band? Killer singer.
Yep, I'm a songwriter too.
so maybe you could join the band.
Hey, mate.
Is this still Silk?
No, that's Sarah, lesbian.
That's weird.
You have a problem with gay women?
Sure, babe.
Let's go, sexy.
<i>I think I'm missing a joke in there somewhere.</i>
<i>But, all right.</i>
She's busy.
Doing what, exactly?
Maybe you should mind your own business,
goddamn pencil dick.
Oh, what's happening now?
Rita. We don't mean Silk any harm.
We just wanted to.
Wanted what?
Andale shaka, topaca, Beyonce and Baraka,
See, you gotta be forceful with these negative entities, Conrad.
You thought what, jackass?
Hey, a little help.
Okay, you did just try to exorcise my girlfriend,
so I'm on her side.
- Nice meeting you, Conrad. - Wow!
You had every right to defend yourself.
He had it coming. Besides, he's a Buddhist.
You really do care, don't you?
I do. I care about you. As. whoever you are.
Silk, Vanessa, Molly, Sarah.
But only because she's kind of rude and bossy and controlling,
but hey, I'm sure she's a lovely person.
Most systems give themselves a name,
Where am I?
In a restaurant.
Hi. My name's Conrad.
I know they're all me, but I haven't been out in decades.
I remember when I was seven, but everything else feels like
I was watching life from behind a glass wall.
Now I get your obsession with the number seven.
Silk was next, yeah. Or, so they told me.
I trust you, right?
Yeah, you do.
Can you tell me more about them?
You want to be impulsive?
Silk is an amazing singer and her band members love her.
Tell me more.
She is snarky, she is fun, and she hates driving.
Although ironically, she loves Grand Theft Auto.
Hates driving?
How the heck can you live in LA and hate driving?
Well, Vanessa loves barbecue and is an amazing chef.
but no judgment. She has great legs.
and no way interested in me, she is a kind and generous soul,
and she really helped with being able to talk to.
Well, all of you. Then, thank you, Sarah.
Yeah.
Me too.
Look.
I felt like he left because of me.
with my grandparents when they went away.
Is that when Silk showed up?
I think they were always there.
But I guess. I wanted to keep the scary parts away.
And that. caused them to fracture.
They had walls between them.
A pizza analogy.
I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
I had to look at my own.
Started when my dad left.
I'd line up my albums and categorize them
by genre and year and color and label.
I had a spreadsheet of every battery in the house,
where it was, and its charge level.
I'd brush my teeth five times a day
with five different toothbrushes.
It's weird, I know.
At least you remember doing it.
I noticed.
Yeah, no, I'm meeting with Paul and Maxine right now.
Cool.
I got you a present.
You ready?
No, I mean, home to Michigan.
They never knew.
I'm sorry, Conrad. You've been amazing.
I have a whole life ahead of me now.
Understanding them.
And you have me,
a little lost and found tag and everything.
You've helped me a lot. And for that, I'm grateful.
But.
What she's trying to tell you, Conrad,
is that she needs her own time.
Two against one, huh?
It's not that she doesn't care about you.
And I want what's best for you to be happy.
What?
She said yes.
but you were taken.
You're not gonna have time for women
No applause, please, no applause.
I'll be here all night.
I miss her, man. I really do.
That stuff was so good that you showed me.
And Molly. And Vanessa, and Sarah.
- Rita. - No, screw her.
Hell no.
To Maxine.
Can't seem to choose which color, though.
Bourbon or wine?
It's okay. There's an ATM in the back.
Oh, okay. I'll be right back.
I'm Melinda. And the generous gentleman is?
I'm Conrad, I'm the chef.
So, what do you cook, Conrad?
<i>Relax, Ego.</i>
<i>We're only</i> <i>a few minutes behind you.</i>
<i>Okay.</i> <i>There's the shoreline.</i>
God help us.
<i>It's awfully quiet.</i>
How about I knock on the door with an old Mack,
<i>It does not</i> <i>appear to be operational.</i>
<i>Welcome to North Kiyung.</i>
Is any of this ancient military shit operational?
This doesn't feel right.
Something's wrong.
Anybody see it? Country?
Negative, no joy.
Right. Missile. There!
<i>Warning, warning.</i>
<i>We have friendlies</i> <i>down in the hot zone.</i>
<i>I repeat, we have friendlies</i> <i>down in the hot zone.</i>
Come on.
Don't cheat, yeah, don't cheat.
Stay straight, stay straight, get up.
Don't cheat. Two more.
Two more. Last one.
put it away, put it away.
Air Force baby, that's how we do it!
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.
- Congratulations, man. - Oh, man. Got it.
- Congratulations. - Hey, thank you.
- Good job. - Thanks.
Man, hey, not gonna lie.
That last one kinda hurt.
Looks like it.
so try not to hurt yourself, all right?
Especially with these guys over here.
I'll be ready.
You couldn't move the flight stick.
Yada, yada, yada, yada.
Oh, my gosh. No, no, no, no.
- That was-- - No, come on,
you can't do it, not this time.
That was different, man.
You were one of them.
Okay. Just be ready.
Are we--are we gonna go? Are we going to North Kiyung?
Let's just say I got a hunch.
All right?
Just be ready for anything.
Well, I'm gonna need a team.
I mean, these guys at AFLA, they're good,
but I don't think they can handle any of that.
Listen, we'll be fine. Come on, man.
It's the red, white, and blue, baby.
Now go get 'em.
<i>Angle to your departure.</i>
<i>Frequency is 263.07.</i>
Target is six miles and coming fast.
Here we go, Baby Bear.
Hey, Edge, what do we got on the mission playlist today?
<i>How about</i> <i>something a little more subtle</i>
like Christian like this time around.
Oh, I got just the track.
Take it to Buster girls.
multiple amounts of missile tests.
At 0600 hours this morning,
they managed to land one sixty miles
outside the Russia shoreline.
As we speak, the Navy is sending out
a second aircraft carrier to the border of South Kiyung.
The losses will be catastrophic.
We'd be sending off fighters to their death.
one of the Joint Chiefs-of-staff recommendations.
Eliminating Kim Wun would buy us some time,
but it does not stop the missile production.
Kill his cousins, his uncles, his nephew,
his girlfriend, son-in-law?
I think eliminating one man's family tree
is certainly more beneficial to us than someone
And I think the National Security Council
would agree.
Good morning Colonel.
Colonel. Grace Daley National Security.
So that makes 24 shows this year?
That's affirmative.
It's actually not that bad.
Listen we have to--
Russian MiGs?
Let's get inside.
Just earlier today
we had some unexpected visitors
over the Atlantic Ocean when two MiGs
flew just twenty feet off the deck
of one of our Navy aircraft carriers.
A spokesperson from the Navy tells us that they immediately
The MiGS claimed to be on a training exercise
and stated they were simply saying hello to the carrier
We'll be right back.
Yeah. Okay, next time we're up there,
let me buzz one of their ships
and see how well that's saying hello stories.
- Yeah, baby. - Yeah. Woo.
Man, they gotta change my call sign to Hollywood, man.
I'm making the news.
- Hell, yeah. - Hey, sweetheart.
Funny, I didn't see your face on the report.
Now, that's funny. I'd expect that out of Riddles.
Hey, do you--do you hear something over here, huh?
Got it.
- It's just a little wasp. - Get over yourself, Igor.
It's Ego.
But don't worry you'll get it Widows.
It's okay.
Edge, no. Edge.
How about I rip out your tongue
What's your problem anyway, Jeeter?
one of your ex-girlfriends?
you might be a pilot, but it don't mean you can fly
and any one of these girls, including myself,
will outmaneuver you in the sky any day.
and you do a couple barrel rolls and an air show once a week,
Your girls is doing tricks so people clap.
- Right. - Big deal.
- Okay. Really? - Guys, Commander's coming.
Chill out.
Commander.
Is there a story behind this?
No, ma'am.
Air show went well today?
Yes, ma'am. Another one in the books.
Good to hear.
Looks like you'll get headed to Maryland next week.
- Good luck. - Excuse me, Commander.
on some maneuvering for the Maryland show
dog fight simulation?
I don't see why not.
If it helps with your show routine.
I'll run it past the Admiral.
Thank you, Commander.
<i>The United States</i> <i>has placed sanctions</i>
<i>on North Kiyung</i> <i>and some of its financial firms</i>
<i>in Giannia,</i> <i>in an effort to tighten the rope</i>
<i>North Kiyung released</i> <i>a public statement today</i>
They have been threatening us since way before our time.
They're not gonna do anything.
Yeah, I don't know what it is,
but that guy just does not like us.
Don't mention it.
One of them being Olson Walter, only 22 years old,
<i>the condition of the Americans</i> <i>is currently unknown.</i>
Those poor guys didn't do anything.
They're just using 'em as leverage
Did you guys know that their whole country
believes America is just military?
Yeah, I read that somewhere.
They have like pictures of American military men
Yup.
They think the whole reason we exist is just to attack them.
Whatever it is, I'm an American.
Speaking of flying, Edge tomorrow,
let's keep it cool up there, yeah?
That's the plan, Lieutenant.
All right, TV off. Rec time, girls.
It's show time, boy.
<i>What's the rules, Jeeter?</i>
Rules are simple.
until the rest of the wing chickies join you.
And when we get a missile lock?
Thanks, Stixx.
Riot and I will skim the pool.
Edge and Wiki, you're the sheets.
- Get some cover. - Game on.
Copy, bro. Eyes on lock.
Taking her down.
Hold on.
They're right behind us, bro.
- They're right behind us. - I see her.
Oh, not today.
Head locked and painted.
Woo! One for the ladies.
Damn it.
Sorry, Jeeter. Another drink is on this flight.
It's all right, Lieutenant.
- Did he say over? - That's what I heard.
No!
<i>- Shit.</i> - Damn, that was close.
That's how they get you.
Her range never pays off.
Where'd he go?
I see him. He's going head on.
Tag it and bag it, Edge.
<i>Jeeter, you got Edge</i> <i>coming right towards us.</i>
Change course, buddy.
You might wanna tighten your buckle up
Country's back. She's on our 6:00.
Edge, fall back.
Might wanna move, Lieutenant.
This one's personal.
Edge, move out.
Country's got him.
Not good. Not good.
Country, get us out of here.
Damn it.
Shit!
even in the handbook?
And that's two for the ladies.
Oh, my God.
Just great.
for our rights as women?
Is there a captain or a commander or someone
who's gonna defend my rights and my dignity as a woman?
Can we serve the country just like the men?
And you are.
- Okay, guys, come on. - I am, yes.
Under pressure, I am.
we would never hear the end of it.
They'd be laughing at us even more.
I'll be damned if I let any man label me
or my team as anything less than equal.
So what? Maybe I upset our government today
and my superiors, but I know I stood up
for every woman on the planet by shutting Jeeter's mouth.
Look, I respect your Christianity
and your devotion to Christ.
You're supposed to love, forgive, and all of that.
and a member of this team is to protect us,
Now, I don't know about you, Country,
but to me... that stands for something.
<i>I don't know</i> <i>who the hell authorized</i>
<i>that ridiculous circus act.</i>
I understand, Admiral. I'm looking into it now.
- within the hour. - Within the hour, sir.
Good day, Admiral.
Well, I don't think I need to explain much
as I'm sure you overheard.
You're losing control of your squadron, Lieutenant?
No, ma'am.
and I've already spoken with Lieutenant Lee
about the situation to assure it doesn't happen again.
or a contest of colorful actions,
Unfortunately, it happened.
As the team leader, I must assume responsibility
for my Wing Girls' actions, ma'am.
The flight recorder is going to reflect
that Lieutenant Riebach gave me a direct order
numerous times and I disobeyed Commander.
Policy?
You're really gonna stand here and try to educate me
No, no, no, ma'am.
That was not what I was trying to say, wrong choice of words.
You're damn right, bad choice of words.
All of you get in here.
from pilot duty and suspended until further notice.
Ladies, these aircraft are not toys.
I've been tested numerous times in my career
unfortunately, I'm gonna have to ask you
Dismissed.
So how long do you guys think we'll be suspended for?
No idea.
I hear the Wing Girls are performing next weekend
Oh, that's right.
Show is canceled.
Never mind.
Hey, Edge, knock, knock.
- Who's there? - Ida.
- Ida who? - Ida rather be suspended
Hey, Country.
Look. Not tonight, Billy.
- So unless you're gonna just-- - Look...
I'm really sorry for how things went down today.
It's just guys being guys.
Well, we certainly weren't discharged.
We're just taking a small break.
that I think it's really great
what you guys are doing,
representing the women and all.
I'm glad to have you guys here.
Is Jeeter in line somewhere behind you?
Jeeter?
some punishment himself.
Don't expect an apology from him.
Jeeter will always be Jeeter.
Thank you.
a couple of us down to North Kiyung.
You know, be careful up there, Billy.
That's not the most welcoming sky
for fighters as we've learned.
I hope to serve with you again, Lieutenant.
I'd be honored.
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>
<i>Today, we're gonna put you right</i> <i>in the heart of enemy territory.</i>
<i>You're outnumbered, two to one.</i>
Only two? Come on, Colonel.
Hey, I'm okay with two.
Of course you are, Poet.
You're a rider, not a fighter.
Ooh, splash one.
<i>No worries, boys.</i>
As soon as I down my bogies, come over for the leftovers.
Here they come.
And they hate smiling.
On 1984, there was an actor that gave
one of the greatest lines of all time.
How's that sound?
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>
The Black man ain't dying first.
Come on now.
Splash one...
and splash two.
What was that, 30 seconds?
Somebody get Bells his smiley face sticker so we can go home.
<i>There we go.</i>
I wanna fly with you.
I know kiddo.
so why don't you go get it while daddy leaves. Okay?
Okay. Okay.
Go ahead. Go get it.
Wow.
I'm a pilot.
Mommy!
Come here.
Oh, hey.
Oh, I miss you so much.
Look what grandma got me, mommy.
Wow, a fighter jet.
That's very cool.
so I could chase seagulls like you do.
Well, you wanted a Christian daughter,
that was the easiest G-rated way I could put it.
Hey, look. Who's here?
- Hi, Riddles. - Hey, Falcon.
Look what I can do.
Margo!
This bitch gotta be kidding me.
Margo, wake up!
It's kind of hard not to.
Why do you want Tyler? It's my first day home.
Can I just sleep in?
I thought you said you were gonna quit once Mom passed away.
If my name was Coors Light, he'd be happy to see me.
That's a hella way to talk about your dad.
I'm surprised Dad even let you crash here.
And just show up unannounced.
Are you listening to yourself?
I'm his daughter, which makes me your sister.
Not for nothing, dickhead.
This is my house, too.
It was your home, okay?
Get up.
Dick.
Now, in the Korean War,
we lost 2,837 aircrafts
and that was in 1950.
but so has our missile stockpile.
As you saw on my test today,
we were unsuccessful when evading the SAMs
North Kiyung knows this and I can assure you,
This is where we're gonna need pilots
Now, we don't have time to train for this,
we need to do this in three stages.
To put it bluntly, North Kiyung.
Ah. A lot I could say about that.
Getting worse by the minute.
Washington needs to figure out something quickly.
I don't know if you're aware, but we are
and eliminating the constant threat of nuclear attacks.
And one of your squadrons became a unit of interest
We've already sent two aircraft carriers over
and multiple squadrons to the southern border
I lost my husband there.
I can tell you that we are looking
for your best pilots
with advanced aerial capabilities.
A squadron that can maneuver through such conditions.
on advanced maneuvering with our pilots daily.
I wish I could help you but unfortunately, I don't have
Sure you do.
Absolutely not.
With all due respect, Commander,
you're asking me to volunteer six women who are aerial
stunt performers, not combat aviators.
She's a devoted Christian and she won't participate
in combat, hence, why she flies for the aerial demo team.
flying a $40 million aircraft just for fun.
Our government trained them for combat,
I'm quite sure if they refuse the order,
they will be restricted from flying.
And then, perhaps, we could offer them a job at the mall,
handing out Navy brochures
Yeah. That one's not gonna work.
They're already suspended,
by our government.
Well, Commander, I will have an order on your desk
by day's end tomorrow to unsuspend them.
And I can assure you, I will have the total support
from the Department of Defense
and our National Security Council
to proceed with this operation.
You will be hearing from us very soon.
Good day, Commander.
Dude, what the hell?
Dude, what did they teach you
in basic training? Come on.
When's the last time you shot a gun?
Try it again.
Nice shot.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, well, Dad had a hot date
It's not like you guys want my family anyway.
That's right. Wing Girls, fly or die.
- Told you it was your gun. - Whatever.
Oh, hey, Country. Is your Mom around?
I was gonna say hello and catch up?
Yeah, she's inside, uh, go ahead.
Kaden, Commander called. She said it was important.
Well, whatever it is,
I'm on my time now.
As of 0600 hours,
you are reinstated for duty.
you will be under AFLR's command.
May I ask a question, ma'am?
- Go ahead. - AFLR as in
Air Force Last Resort Operation Center?
That's correct, Lieutenant.
to ask for additional details, Commander?
I don't have the details, ladies.
What I can tell you is that the US Navy
and running some training exercises with you.
Leave your grudges at the door.
I don't wanna send them delirious,
lazy-eyed pilots in the morning.
Good night, ladies.
Dismissed.
I got a bad feeling about this.
No one goes to AFLR unless they're going into combat.
AFLR is boarding our ship,
we aren't going anywhere,
and that's not true, Bear.
or something, okay?
Let's just wait and see what happens tomorrow.
Really?
We can always say no, can't we?
I have to tell you I'm quite excited that you all are here.
that comes through the Air Force Last Resort program,
is quite rare, so welcome.
and well-respected pilots for our service,
We're gonna be boarding your carrier
and running a series of training exercises.
Lieutenant Riebach?
Is anyone gonna explain to us
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sure you're all quite curious
as to why the Air Force Last Resort program
is interested in your services.
Soon enough, we will fill you in on all those details.
I need to see if you even fit the criteria for the operation.
I am seeking the best of the best,
it was your exceptional skills and abilities that did.
Tomorrow, we're going to test those abilities,
because it's one thing to serve your country,
but when you're called to duty,
will you protect it?
I want you all to think about that.
- Hi. - What's up, guys?
- How you guys doing? - Hello.
What's up, man?
Baby, how you doin', dude?
Oh, man. Oh, they ain't with me.
Captain Middleton, call sign Mooney.
I'd love to hear the story on that name sometime.
Lieutenant Riebach, call sign Country.
This is Wiki, Edge, Riddles,
Bear, and Riot.
Riddles, huh? You must be the comedic relief
- of the bunch. - I try.
Just so y'all know,
Superman ain't got nothin' me.
I'm just a call away.
Travon Dixon, call sign Poet.
Ah. Who would've guessed?
You guys wouldn't happen to know, like,
what we're doing here, would you?
Uh, it's just what I was asking my pal, Baby, here.
Come on, guys. Really?
Great. As if one isn't enough.
Hey, there.
I guess you felt a little left out.
Lieutenant Lee.
- Baby. - I don't care.
Jeeter, apologize to my sisters.
But like it or not, you are flying with us.
So, how about we just smile and get through this, yeah?
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, that's fine.
I'll see you in the sky.
We're gonna have some fun.
All right. Later, Country.
See you, Bear.
I'm telling you guys right now,
- he's-- - Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh. - Whoa.
Uh, perfect actually.
Captain Harris. Call me Bells, please.
We call him Shortstop. There's no explanation needed.
How do you do? I, uh, call sign Clownz.
But, uh, gotta go
Right. Yeah. You go do that.
- All right. - All right. Yeah.
it's awesome to have you guys here.
I'm really excited.
I gotta admit,
I'm a little star struck.
I, uh, been watching you guys
in your last few shows.
It's pretty impressive.
you're pretty good yourself.
I concur.
- Really, guys? - Yeah, well, who knows?
Maybe we'll make you better.
We'll just--we'll just forget about that
let's say we'll make a good team?
Yeah. Let's see how good you fly first.
Lady's got some bite. I like it.
Yeah. On that note, we're gonna hit the showers.
See you guys up in the clouds?
<i>Uh, check to the 3-6-0.</i>
Feels good to be back up here, doesn't it, Bear?
<i>That was probably Riot.</i>
Guys.
Ha, ha.
Kill the chatter, girls.
<i>There are two persons</i> <i>of interest</i>
parked on top of Devil's Ridge.
Copy?
That's it?
Damn. Okay. Easy first day.
for a wedding photographer, Colonel?
<i>Angry Birds, your mission is</i>
<i>to prevent them from getting it.</i>
Angry Birds? What?
We got two eagles and a warning, incoming.
Now this is one Charlie Foxtrot
that I don't mind.
All right, gentlemen.
Let's keep it clean up here, okay?
All right, Jeeter, Baby, and Bells.
It's okay. Bear, Edge, and Riddles,
keeping them busy.
I'll take Wiki and Riot to the objective. Copy?
- Game on. - Let's get it going.
Operation Mug Shot begins in three, two, one.
Right behind you, Mooney, on your 6:00.
I'm gonna skim the deck.
I'm taking them down.
Hey. They ain't gonna go that easy, Mooney.
All right, ladies. Time to open the umbrella.
- Got lock. - Take it.
<i>I ain't bailing, no way.</i>
Time to light the fires and take 'em higher.
- And there she goes. - Don't lose her, Jeeter.
and now I know why they call you Baby.
Talk to me, Bear.
He's all over me.
Okay, girls. I got a maneuver
that's gonna put us right behind them.
But, Bear, I'm gonna need you to dive
The Dosey? Are you nuts? They could hit us head-on.
Edge, that's not a good idea.
It won't work if only three of you know the routine.
It's too risky.
We're almost at the objective.
- Sit tight, girls. - How about you focus
on keeping them off your ass?
Bear, dive now.
On my way, ladies.
- Talk to me fast. - As soon as we meet,
you're dead.
Buckle up my little hamburger helper,
Always left arm, always.
- Three... - Edge?
<i>I'm coming in, 3:00,</i> <i>through the middle.</i>
Captain, we should pull out.
Two...
Everybody, knock it off.
This is not an air show. Let's go.
<i>Warning, warning, warning,</i>
<i>warning, warning,</i> <i>warning, warning.</i>
Dammit.
- One. - Look out.
- Whoa. - Look out -
<i>Ha-ha, damn that was close.</i>
<i>Woo. Dosey Doe!</i>
I told you.
Splash one.
- Shit. - Mooney is called Boomey,
<i>game over.</i>
Let's make that two.
<i>Splash one.</i>
Woo! Ah!
Jeeter and Baby are out of there.
Back to the birdhouse boys.
There's our objective.
Say cheese.
Wing Girls, one. Angry Birds, zero.
Pucker factor was definitely high, but good job.
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.
I appreciate you.
I do.
I would take a missile for you and you know that.
The next time you disobey my order,
Crystal.
What I saw today is unacceptable.
that you may serve under two branches,
if it's a male or a female.
Let's not wait for the alarms to go off.
Colonel?
The only thing you managed to prove to me
is that these girls can take a picture
and their lack of communication in that ridiculous maneuver
that almost cost six lives and six aircraft, Colonel.
I'd be talking to you from behind a plate glass window
- what they can do yet. - I don't know.
And if I'm not mistaken,
and it was completed.
Get the job done, isn't it?
and who you are speaking to?
Now, proceed.
What's up?
Taegan, wait.
Look...
you know if I thought for even a second
that if I was putting you in harm's way,
I wouldn't have done it.
So, uh...
Cool.
on why you're here, I suppose?
Ain't for no F-35s.
No. We're an air show team.
We don't--
no.
My girls and I don't do combat.
Just keep that in the back of your mind.
It's all so dark and mysterious
when the one you want doesn't want you, too.
Cute.
Is that one yours?
Backstreet Boys.
He's got charm.
Well, well, well. Who we got here?
It's the legendary Wasps.
This is the crazy one. Tell me.
How did it feel
Well, I didn't fall from heaven.
Something wrong with this girl.
Come on.
Look. You girls, you--
Look. I don't know whose daddy knows
If I'm not mistaken, you were chasing us.
So, say it like it is.
You're mad because you were outsmarted by a bunch of women.
- Okay. Okay. - I see.
- That's enough. - Yeah.
Don't be screwing the pooch on this one.
That's fine, man.
Come on.
Go back to your bitches, Jeeter.
Yeah.
Don't mind him.
- To Wing Girls. - Wing Girls.
<i>Okay, ladies.</i>
<i>In today's training exercise,</i> <i>we're going to focus</i>
<i>Proceed through the canyons,</i> <i>to the convoy target.</i>
<i>Take it out.</i>
Oops, a little rusty. Sorry.
Lieutenant Rossi, you are go for your attack run.
Copy that.
Target visual, and fire.
Shit.
in a few days?
Lieutenant Beckett, initiate your attack run.
Copy that.
Switching to guns.
Negative, Lieutenant. This is missiles only.
Damn. That felt good.
Nice one, Riddles.
Bring them home.
<i>Oh, you said missile.</i>
That's what it sounded like to me.
That's what I heard.
Well, hell, coming right up.
FOX 2.
Fire, FOX 2.
Woo!
<i>What else you got,</i> <i>command?</i>
Now as a squadron, you are very advanced
Operation?
Today, your ability to follow orders
to set your differences aside and get along.
if you're too busy fighting yourselves.
Definitely eliminates the possibility
They can't possibly think that we're capable of flying
in any type of physical combative operation.
They have 17,000 pilots in the service.
Yup.
And only 700 women.
Six of them are right here.
Would you guys listen to yourselves?
You're pilots for the United States Navy,
Down in history, yeah.
Down behind enemy lines?
Yeah, I just don't know.
As the United States plans to meet
with the President of Xiangyu today,
Kin Huan has tested a rocket believed to be capable
that he says "will turn Americans to ashes."
I mean, it's ridiculous.
We're going to battle.
Somebody need to tell these girls this,
get their mind in the right place.
But unfortunately, you, I, us,
like it's some damn spring break freakin' air show.
There's no choreography in war.
That's right.
If that missile wants you, it's gonna get you.
Or die trying.
If Colonel thought they weren't good enough,
Hey, what are we, chopped liver?
You're a nurse, not a pilot.
Whoa.
Big difference.
What did you and I talk about, man?
- Right. - Families first.
Right.
All right.
Good luck.
Let's give them the Raptor.
Incoming.
F-22.
<i>Let me guess.</i>
They want us to catch that thing.
Let's paint it.
No joy. Country, you got it?
Negative.
Shit! Lost 'em.
I got 'em, Edge.
Lost 'em. Damn it!
Where'd he go?
If this isn't the shit show of all shit shows.
It's Washington.
Mr. President.
We could use a little more time.
Well, I suggest you get them ready.
God-willing it's just a test,
Now, these girls were your plan.
Break the news to them.
Their next air show is over North Kiyung.
that is escalating rather quickly with North Kiyung,
a threat that needs to be addressed immediately.
Told you.
The training exercises you've participated in
over the last few days
were crucial in determining the success of this mission.
We are confident that each and every one of you
to keep this country safe
and end this threat immediately.
Ms. Daley?
Gentlemen and ladies,
as boldly and as clearly as I can.
Thirty minutes ago,
They have repeatedly threatened our families here at home.
This is unacceptable,
and they must be stopped.
you are putting your country in jeopardy
of a nuclear attack.
In three days, you will attack North Kiyung.
- Wait, what? - Is this really happening?
We do not accept these orders.
Excuse me?
But my squadron is not a combat squadron.
We were brought here without a clue
that we were gonna be sent to combat,
I would've refused from the very beginning.
Colonel?
in the sky of North Kiyung.
We are a demonstration team, sir.
Not combat.
I'm sorry.
<i>that spy satellites</i> <i>had detected activity -</i>
What are you doing?
<i>...long-range</i> <i>missile has recently...</i>
Packing.
They're just gonna suspend us again.
- But I'm not gonna wait. - So that's it?
as soon as your country needs you?
I watched him get blown to pieces before my eyes.
Think about what your father would do and what he would want.
And that's where you'll find the right answer.
<i>We have some very unfortunate</i>
breaking news out of Washington.
It's coming in right now.
Olson Walter, the 22-year-old student
that was previously imprisoned in North Kiyung,
has died at his home this evening
North Kiyung leader Kin Huan has released a statement.
He promised every American citizen
will scream in terror
<i>now that he has an ICBM</i>
<i>capable of reaching Los Angeles,</i>
and possibly even Washington and New York.
Please stay with us. We'll be right back.
<i>All right. Joe Wilson,</i> <i>live from the Pentagon.</i>
<i>All right. Tensions are still</i> <i>heating up across the West</i>
<i>launched yet</i> <i>another test missile.</i>
<i>That's seven missiles total</i> <i>in the last three weeks.</i>
<i>The Department of Defense</i> <i>will be joining us shortly</i>
<i>and briefing us</i> <i>with the latest developments...</i>
Look, if you give me just a couple hours,
Well, I suggest you think of something
because in approximately 60 hours, we're--
I will protect it.
I'm sorry?
It's one thing to serve your country.
I will.
And I'd like the details of the operation, sir.
Oh, Colonel.
Okay. Uh-hmm.
Shouldn't you be in final briefing?
Can I speak freely with you, Colonel?
You know, just Kaden to Julian.
Sure. What's up?
I just--
that there's no more hidden agenda.
and Squadron-2 comes in and does all the dirty work.
We all head home together.
That's it.
Can that be a promise?
Lieutenant...
you're going into a battle zone.
-I mean-- -I need that promise.
Sure.
I promise.
Okay. Thank you.
Please forgive me for what I'm about to do.
Watch over me.
And be my wings.
<i>The nuclear facility</i> <i>is buried 60 miles</i>
<i>in the mountains of Baganiya.</i>
<i>unfortunately,</i> <i>you'll need to get past</i>
<i>their coastal defenses.</i>
<i>Wing Girls will be leading</i> <i>this operation</i>
<i>You will be referred to</i> <i>as the Iron Angels.</i>
<i>Stay below 5,000 feet.</i>
<i>without being picked up</i> <i>on radar.</i>
<i>Once you break</i> <i>the 200-mile mark,</i>
<i>very quickly.</i>
<i>They're going to throw</i> <i>everything they have at you.</i>
<i>Give them an air show</i> <i>they've never seen before.</i>
<i>Squadron-2 will punch through</i>
<i>and take out</i> <i>the nuclear facility.</i>
<i>Once Squadron-2</i> <i>takes out the facility,</i>
<i>Make us proud.</i>
Hey, Bells, What the hell happened?
Well, Washington gave it the green light.
First wave just left.
Green light?
Tell me Country and her team are not on that first wave.
Give me airborne now.
I said now.
You're a girl?
Ha-ha-ha, no way, American scum. Bring it on.
Almost got him and FOX 2.
Thanks a lot. He got away.
Tss. Nah, he just got scared.
Didn't have to shoot them.
And you still saved the world.
I'm Lieutenant Claymont.
I fly with your mother.
Thanks for your service.
that's for sure.
Hey, Dad.
What? No salute for me?
Uh...
Lighten up. I'm just messing with you.
Yeah. First of all, I'm sorry.
I guess I--I guess I should have knocked first.
I actually have a special package
from Ms. Riebach for her daughter.
May I?
Can I open it now?
Whenever you'd like.
Why don't you go take it
"If I know my little Falcon,
fighter pilot training
when you were interrupted with this letter.
You're always training and preparing for your time
And one day, you will.
I just wanna let you know that mommy and daddy
will support you in whatever you decide
to do with your life."
<i>and watching these machines</i> <i>fly past.</i>
<i>and I want you to know</i> <i>that no matter what you decide,</i>
<i>Please try to get along</i> <i>with your father.</i>
<i>He loves you so much.</i>
<i>If you ever need</i> <i>to talk to mommy,</i>
How you guys doing?
<i>Anyone awake?</i>
Yeah. I'm ready, Captain.
Any pilot that can sleep
before a preemptive strike,
better pilot than me, man.
Huh? Huh?
Sorry, sorry, I was sleeping.
<i>Oh, splash one by Baby.</i>
<i>Yeah. Okay, Baby,</i>
<i>You're gonna need it.</i>
<i>Only</i> <i>if you're changing it.</i>
<i>I wanna be a Navy pilot.</i>
<i>How about you, Country?</i>
<i>I'm okay.</i>
<i>A little nervous.</i>
Just enjoying the sounds of the Indian night-noises.
<i>Got any preflight jokes</i>
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>it's been a pleasure</i> <i>to serve with you, ladies.</i>
<i>I mean it.</i>
<i>Oh, come on,</i> <i>serve with them?</i>
<i>I'm the one who served</i> <i>with them.</i>
<i>of the sour candy you wanted?</i>
<i>You got something</i> <i>to tell us, Ego?</i>
<i>Jealousy is the pain</i> <i>a man feels</i>
<i>when he is not equally beloved</i>
<i>by the person</i> <i>whom he entirely loves.</i>
<i>Yeah. Perhaps you'd like</i> <i>to give the prestrike toast</i>
<i>Stage is yours.</i>
<i>Okay. Awkward.</i>
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>All I have to say</i> <i>is I don't know how the hell</i>
<i>I got stuck saving the world</i> <i>with a bunch of women.</i>
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>But at least</i> <i>when all hell breaks loose</i>
<i>I'll be okay,</i>
<i>because I'll still have Country</i>
<i>and the Wing Girls</i> <i>to get me home.</i>
<i>Oh, okay, you got jokes.</i>
<i>And I'm honored</i> <i>to fly with you.</i>
<i>All right, Angels,</i> <i>you are weapons-free.</i>
<i>Godspeed, everyone.</i>
<i>It's happening.</i>
<i>- Oh, shit.</i> <i>- Okay.</i>
<i>Let's not fall apart now.</i>
<i>let's do a couple tricks,</i> <i>and get out of here.</i>
<i>Let's do it.</i>
<i>God, I'm nervous.</i>
<i>Time for piloting.</i>
<i>Wiki's, right.</i>
<i>in the world right now.</i>
<i>The audience, they're hostile,</i>
<i>and they do wanna shoot you down</i>
<i>So instead of being nervous,</i>
<i>- Agreed?</i> <i>- Agreed.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Wing Girls for life?</i>
<i>Wing Girls for life.</i>
<i>Now let's go save the world.</i>
<i>I don't feel right</i> <i>being back here, Mooney.</i>
<i>I should be up there with them.</i>
<i>Relax, Ego.</i>
<i>We're only a few minutes</i> <i>behind them.</i>
<i>Hey, there's the shoreline.</i>
God help us.
<i>It's awfully quiet.</i>
<i>Radar should</i> <i>have detected us by now.</i>
<i>Strange.</i>
<i>I see something.</i>
<i>It does not appear</i> <i>to be operational.</i>
<i>Welcome to North Kiyung.</i>
<i>Anybody see it? Country?</i>
<i>- Negative, no joy.</i> <i>- I got nothing.</i>
<i>It's gone.</i>
<i>Nothing here.</i>
<i>I think it</i> <i>was a false alarm, guys.</i>
<i>We picked up some</i> <i>activity momentarily.</i>
<i>Be cautious.</i>
<i>It's an ambush.</i> <i>Get them out of there, Colonel.</i>
<i>That signals them locking out</i> <i>of on to their coordinates.</i>
<i>Shit don't work.</i>
<i>Yeah. I believe they said</i> <i>we'll be flying in the most</i>
<i>dangerous skies in the world.</i>
<i>Angels, we are picking</i> <i>up multiple missiles.</i>
<i>- Missile!</i> <i>- I got incoming!</i>
<i>There!</i>
<i>- We got missiles!</i> <i>- Guys, look out!</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>Wiki!</i>
<i>Angel -</i>
<i>I've lost control</i> <i>of the aircraft.</i>
<i>Wiki!</i>
<i>No one goes to AFLR unless</i> <i>they're going into combat.</i>
<i>We aren't going anywhere.</i>
<i>Angels, you have</i> <i>multiple bandits airborne.</i>
<i>Warning! Warning! Warning!</i>
<i>Distraction coming up.</i>
<i>Time to burn some gas</i> <i>and kick some ass.</i>
<i>Angry birds, you need</i> <i>to get to that objective.</i>
<i>The Angels</i> <i>have been compromised.</i>
<i>but it might not be for long.</i>
<i>Move it.</i>
<i>Sorry, fellas.</i>
<i>I'm going after the girls.</i>
<i>You heard the order, Ego.</i>
<i>We're going to the objective.</i>
<i>Those are my girls.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>Shit!</i>
<i>That's it, fellas,</i> <i>let's bring it over here.</i>
<i>This one's for the girls.</i>
<i>On my way.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>Keep it coming, boys.</i>
<i>Ah, shit.</i>
<i>Got three left on me</i> <i>and one off windows.</i>
<i>I'm taking the shot.</i>
<i>Bandit down.</i>
<i>Riddle!</i>
<i>Mayday, Angel 3, I'm going down.</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i> <i>Get down, Bear!</i>
<i>Motherfuck...</i>
<i>Mayday, mayday.</i>
<i>This is Angel 2.</i> <i>I took a direct hit.</i>
<i>All systems are - Fubar,</i> <i>and I got a MiG</i>
<i>still on my 6:00.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>
<i>Yes, you are.</i>
<i>Jeeter.</i>
<i>just a little bit longer.</i>
<i>Just got locked.</i>
<i>He's locking me up, Edge.</i>
<i>Almost there, Jeeter.</i>
<i>Just a little bit longer.</i>
<i>Warning. Warning.</i> <i>Warning. Warning.</i>
<i>- Made it. Made it.</i> <i>- Eject!</i>
<i>Edge, bad news.</i>
<i>- My hydraulics are down.</i> <i>- FOX 2.</i>
<i>Clear, Jeeter.</i> <i>Get the hell out of there.</i>
<i>Edge, do you copy? Edge?</i>
<i>Skykeeper, we have friendlies</i> <i>down in the hot zone.</i>
<i>I repeat, we have friendlies</i> <i>down in the hot zone.</i>
<i>I'm currently</i> <i>assessing the situation.</i>
<i>Country, I'm coming to you.</i>
<i>We're in a lot of danger</i> <i>right now.</i>
<i>and I'm gonna stay on yours.</i> <i>Okay?</i>
<i>Yes?</i>
<i>Shit.</i>
<i>Believe that shit?</i>
<i>Attention, aircraft.</i>
<i>This is Lieutenant Riebach</i> <i>from the United States Navy</i>
<i>and I am the last voice</i> <i>you're gonna hear.</i>
<i>That's my girl.</i>
<i>Let's drop.</i>
<i>I got him.</i>
<i>Splat.</i>
<i>Nice shot.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>SAM incoming.</i>
<i>I'll keep the missile busy.</i>
<i>Country, wait.</i>
<i>Shit.</i>
<i>I got you.</i>
<i>FOX 2.</i>
<i>Bogie down.</i>
<i>Country?</i>
<i>Country!</i>
<i>Today is not only</i> <i>an anxiously proud day</i>
<i>for the American people</i> <i>as the airstrikes against</i>
<i>Seven of our brave men and women</i>
<i>and devote their lives</i> <i>to keeping us all safe</i>
<i>We lower our flag</i> <i>in the hopes that they are alive</i>
<i>and with the intention</i> <i>of bringing them home safely.</i>
<i>I'm Julia Dalton.</i>
<i>We all head home together.</i>
<i>I promise.</i>
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>
The commander called and said something about they found Edge.
Yes.
The doctor will be with you shortly.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.
- Is she okay? - Calm down.
Please tell me she's okay.
She's home.
That's what's important.
she's in a coma, Kaden.
Margo, can you hear me?
and I love you very, very much.
You're a strong woman.
I know you're gonna get out of this.
Country.
<i>My job as a pilot</i> <i>for the United States Navy</i>
<i>and a member of this team</i> <i>is to protect us.</i>
Some coffee?
Maybe some scotch?
I'm fine.
We're fine. Thank you.
I spoke with Commander Mosko today.
She said Edge really hadn't improved too much.
How you doing? Are you okay?
How do you think I'm doing, Colonel?
Look, Kaden...I know.
I have reason to believe
that a lot of them are still alive.
What?
This conversation,
it stays right here.
- Yes. - Captain?
Of course, sir.
The UN uses a channel
which has been an avenue of communication
between the US and North Kiyung.
regarding American prisoners.
They're alive.
How do we know they're not bluffing?
Couldn't they just be saying this to gain
Because they said...
the prison camps have never smelled so beautiful before.
My girls...
What's the plan?
We can't just let them sit there
Well, unfortunately, there is no plan.
Not right now, anyways.
within the last few days.
It just so happens...
that I am very close with God.
My hands are burning. I can't hold him.
Hold his shoulder!
Calm down, my boy.
Hold his hand properly!
Okay. - Help him.
Datta, watch him.
I have no idea.
stomach-ache, loose motions, vomiting.
Please check these medicines.
If food didn't cause this, what caused it?
You're a doctor. Say something.
Maybe they had a lot of dirty moonshine.
A middle-aged woman and a girl drank moonshine?
Do you think it's teeming with thieves, drunkards and scums?
Does he look like a drunkard to you?
He is a doctor! Jaggu!
Get lost... - I am leaving.
'On 900 meters, turn left towards'
He should get used to troubles.
'In 15 meters, take a left.'
Box number 1 will have kitchen stuff.
Box number three will cover the living room.
My dad was always on the move,
so my Mom made a career out of moving and packing.
My Mom... - Damn with her husband!
Wait... - It's my number.
Gosh! Looks like, there's a water shortage.
No point in fighting among ourselves.
He then started a water tanker agency to sell us water.
It's a small truck.
Don't rush. - Okay.
Please watch our boxes.
"Isn't it?"
"My breeze is yours now."
"You are my thread, my string You are my breeze."
'this new disease is running through Janata Nagar slum area in Dombivli.'
'I am Anjali Mhatre with cameraman Shivgopalan'
'and you're watching News Superfast.'
'Stay alert 24 hours.'
"Oh boy... Oh, girl! - A scorpion stung him!"
"A scorpion stung me!"
It looked very smashing. Let's make a video together.
What's happening to you?
Stay away! Santya.
He's going to work.
Your son makes a mess.
Right? - It's okay.
Listen to me. The prayer room must face northeast.
You know northeast? A direction between east and north.
No one's uncle here. - Okay. Brother.
Stop doing that and sign this.
Put this on your office desk.
Madam, can I ask you something?
Did the baby really kick?
"She sauntered in, with style with grace and all."
I don't have water.
'A healthy body needs minerals.'
'Presenting the world's first mineral infused water'
'That is our solid guarantee.'
How will we save ourselves?
Down with Appa Musale!
We're not shipping it to China.
It's our water! - Not your private property!
It's our water... - Get lost.
Take him away. Come on.
Stay in your limits. Understand?
The cops are just a phone call away.
You'll find yourself behind bars in a flash.
Then you can protest from the jail!
Should I call the boss?
So? - Listen...
Now get lost. Move.
He is crazy. - Okay.
He's just running a scam.
Staring into that mirror won't grow your muscles.
I do 101 push-ups in the morning.
Push-ups! - Of course.
You made me quit drinking
Dad. - Hmm?
Six months ago, you forgot to get a condom,
so that's why we ended up like this.
Dear, you are so smart.
You take after your Mom.
and we are getting a raw deal.
You guys should call for a strike!
Then Mr. Musale will sack all of us.
First, don't give Muslya so much respect.
You are slaves!
Enough with the Jaggu tales.
First, I went to the local pharmacy.
They don't sell spicy-tart chickpeas.
Sarcasm of a Punekar in Dombivli. Another level of cuteness.
Here. - Thank you.
Don't drink if you can't handle it!
I'm on my way.
Bye. - Hang up. Bye.
What are you doing? Stay away!
Save me! Save me!
people in our slum falling sick.
They are going crazy.
I know what your plan is.
That old drunkard attacks me.
Then both of you will swindle me.
You called me thieves?
He is a psycho! Go away.
Don't take Jaggu seriously. Listen!
He was literally into my face
Even his lips. All white.
I have some advice, ma'am.
We get stressed out when we're transferred.
Someone beat him up, but you blame him.
Thank you. - Leave now.
I mean, he tried to strangle me.
He tried to strangle our security guard.
We'll deal with him, no worries.
It just hit me.
He looked like a zombie.
But what exactly is a zombie?
How do I explain him?
They are not like us.
We eat, we do our daily things.
We take a shower, go to work.
They're not bothered about that.
All they care about is biting someone.
You scowl and attack people!
All right. What's your point?
I saw him with my own eyes!
How's that possible? - It's true.
But your friends blow money on boozing.
Drag them to the factory tomorrow.
Can I get the pollution control board file?
Did Mr. Musale say that?
What have I done? - Talk to the officer.
I'm a party worker of Janshakti Youth League.
You can't arrest me without a cause.
A complaint has been filed against you.
Talking about rights!
I have no idea.
I didn't strangle him.
Your Mom named you Vishwas,
but she named your right hand as Jaggu.
I named him Jaggu, not my Mom.
I saved that engineer! Please hear me out.
I swear, it's the truth.
I won't lie to you.
that you can't work if you are scared.
That's why he invited me to the party.
I'll be back soon. - Okay.
You fools! You get stoned at night
and don't turn up at work in the morning.
I got chewed out by the manager for this.
Please enjoy.
A selfie, please. - Sure.
Sudhir! Sudhir! Please come here.
Sir, he is Sudhir Joshi.
I hear that Vishwas attacked you.
I'm glad you filed a complaint against him.
Joshi. - I don't drink.
Really? That's bad.
Happy birthday to you, sir.
Don't get so nervous, Joshi.
I got your back.
I'll straighten him out.
Janata Nagar Police Station.
There's trouble at Janata Nagar.
How come there's trouble at Janata Nagar when he's locked-up?
I'd already warned you.
Maharashtra will burn. Shut up!
Get the car ready. Quiet!
I see a wall.
I'll give you zero stars. What's your name?
Sir. - He is full of himself.
He is getting too close my comfort.
Don't kill him!
You might break his neck!
He might die, Jaggu.
This is what Jaggu does, sir.
Vishwas, let go!
Are you out of our mind?
"Oh God! The scorpion stung!"
"Who do I tell?"
Madam, let's run!
"What do I do? Where do I go?"
"The scorpion stung!" - Hey wait!
You go there... - Girls, don't be afraid.
Come on, move!
Come on!
Sudhir, let's go.
Don't stare! Step on it!
I'm sure I'll get some important details.
Okay, I'll let you know.
This isn't as easy as it seems.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
Are you all right?
Don't come close to me. You know me.
Hurry! Come on!
They're getting closer. Move!
Media! - Move!
Open the door. - Get in.
Let's go! Come on!
What are you doing? - Let go!
turn into this crazy thing with my own eyes.
Really? - Yes.
Right. Also, they get angrier if you make noise.
they just rushed at us.
They aren't afraid of gods.
I'd recognised them. Didn't I?
Zom... - Zombies in Dombivli?
Zombies in Dombivli?
We appeal to the citizens
What's going on here?
Someone tell them that we are not infected.
that we are not with these slum dwellers.
We live in a tower, so let us go.
Please! Don't fight! - I'll break your teeth.
We should tell the police.
Hands up! Look at me.
Zombies didn't bite us.
Please let us go.
Why is he rambling on?
Look at us. Did you notice?
Please get off the car. Come on.
Come out. Sir... - We are coming.
Zombies haven't bitten me. See. Let me show you.
See. Take a look. See.
You should... - Quiet!
Please... - Don't you touch me.
I read that message on my WhatsApp.
I am giving you a warning.
Sir, they have a gun. - You're dealing with me.
Do not shoot. We are going back.
We're going back... - Citizens should stay at home.
S**t! - I'll find a doctor.
Talk to me. Don't sleep.
They are here too!
Back off!
Open the door! - Wait, don't open it!
Let's go. - Move!
Please open the door! - Open the door.
Get in now! Hurry!
Move! - Careful!
Come on! - Keep moving!
Come on, move.
Are you okay? - Yes.
Do you want something?
It's true.
and we can't contact anyone from outside.
We don't know how to get out of here.
Someone, pay attention to me.
I am with you.
Nurse, get the operating theatre ready.
'Let's watch some videos of Dombivli that went viral
'As you can see, they look hideous'
'The disease originated from Janata Nagar'
'Of course, they'll be infected.'
'get the Rapid Action Force'
'to kill all those demons.'
That's a propaganda to sully Janata Nagar.
Only you are right and true.
They are poor and simple people.
Prove that this disease didn't originate from the slum.
I'd warned you against taking these slum dwellers along.
Next time when a zombie attacks you, I'll throw you to them.
He is out of danger now.
Who among you has the blood group B positive?
I can't donate blood.
I don't want to hurt you and our baby.
Don't open the door even if I knock it.
You are absolutely fine. - Stay away!
Stay away, why don't you understand?
How will we manage without you?
No, Seema, you are very strong.
I'm not worried about the baby as you'll take care of him.
I was very scared.
It all happened all of a sudden.
My dad always found faults with whatever I did.
So I'm glad about this.
Sorry, Seema.
Stay away or else I'll break your head.
Hear me out! - Don't come close.
Don't be silly. - Hey...
Don't scream! You'll rile up the zombies.
Look at this. It has healed. See.
I'd rather fight with zombies.
It's not a bite mark.
Well, it's... it's...
I've taken an injection too.
I am hale and hearty.
He took bullets from the Portuguese to free Goa.
Bullets? Just one bullet from Dombivli Police.
Why is he so happy?
They showed the same symptoms.
That his or her father was a born coward
and remain so for all his life.
I don't want my baby's father to become a zombie.
Damn you! - Vishwas.
Sir, just order me. I'll shoot them down.
Put your gun down! We want him alive.
You loser, pick up the money and get lost!
Vishwas! - Man!
It's out of my hand!
Put it down!
He ran away! - Vishwas.
I asked you to stop!
Take this!
Vishwas, let's go!
Vishwas, let's go!
One more thing.
It's our chance to save these men.
Get in the car now.
But you don't get it.
When they are with us, the police won't let us pass.
I don't want to die, I want to live.
I don't care if you become a zombie!
Let's leave before it's their lunch time.
Let's see if they forgive you.
This guy can speak.
We don't want to die among the zombies!
We don't want to die.
Let's go! Get up!
You saved me twice.
Damn with zombies!
"He bit me! A zombie bit me!"
Run! - What do I do?
"Oh dear! Oh God! - The scorpion stung!"
Doctors, go ahead with everyone.
Sorry, I broke our no driving rule.
Her nose is just like her Mom.
Even her eyes are just like her mom's or his...
Seema, one important point. - Yes?
Don't drive a car. No pick-up truck.
I've brought a black thread from my guru for the baby.
troubles will stay away from her.
"I hid in my home on a new moon night, bolted the door."
"He is possessed!"
"Deep, dark, haunted night striking fear deep into my heart."
"Tried to break the door down, but a zombie jumped on me."
"He sneaks up on you and takes a chunky bite!"
"Crazy and angry. Like a ghost."
"No one was at home and that's when a zombie struck!"
"No one was at home and that's when a zombie struck!"
"He is possessed!"
"Zombies bump into you... - Everywhere you go."
"The path is dangerous... - Strewn with troubles."
"Oh God! - The scorpion stung!"
"Come on, Zombie, come, come."
"I just wanna, wanna say. Run, run, run away!"
"If he caught you... - He bites."
"If you sit... - He bites."
"The scorpion won't go away."
"Stop, stop!"
"Stop the scorpion!"
Running away, huh, dickhead?
Huh, yeah, fucking pussy, you gonna cry again?
You gonna cry again? You gonna cry again?
-You pussy. -You're fucking nothing.
-You worthless piece of shit, Martin. -Fuck you.
-You're pathetic! -Fuck you!
What the fuck?
Yo, pussy.
Oi, piggy!
Dickhead, you deaf?
-Hey... -H-h-hey.
-Are you stupid? -No.
N-n-no. Shut up!
MARTIN: God.
Come on.
-Eat the shit. -What?
Eat. The. Shit. Piggy.
Fucking grab it.
And fucking eat it.
Then we can talk.
-Right? -I'm-m-m sorry. Sorry.
Come here. Come here.
Eat it.
Eat it.
Eat the shit.
Eat the shit.
Eat the fucking shit. Or I swear to God I'll shoot you.
Fucking eat it. Eat the shit. You fucking puss...
THE PROFESSIONAL: Is everything understood?
Yeah, yeah, OK.
Are you threatening me?
OK.
Good boy.
Ugh!
This is so boring.
Where's my brother?
Shut up.
What do you care?
It's kind of gross.
No, not really. I was...
So, who are we protecting today?
An old girlfriend?
Your dad's hot friend.
-What's with the white streak? -X: Finally!
I thought you'd never ask.
Well, I was going through Instagram, right?
I mean, first off, I was like, "Damn!".
-You mean Richard Madden? -Yeah? Yeah.
but it turns out that it's all-natural.
And I thought, I've got to get me one of those.
And so I did, and here I am today. I think it looks sick.
So you copied him?
I'm pretty hot.
and your stupid white hair leads them straight to us?
Ah, see, now, that's why I have the hoodie.
-The hoodie in the bag? -Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That hoodie is fluorescent pink.
Fucking skid-mark head.
-What are you looking at? -You.
Why can't you learn just to enjoy life a little bit? Huh?
So just relax.
That must be him. I'll open up.
No, wait. Stop. He said he'd call before he came over.
Quick, hide the kid in the bathroom.
Stay fucking quiet, o-or I'll come back and cut your tongue, OK?
So open up. Let's-let's greet our guests.
Let's have a little fun.
What?
Hey, we're looking for Alex.
He's not here.
Tell him to fuck off.
-What? -Hey, man,
-I don't think you heard my friend. -Fuck off!
OK.
Look, your friend isn't here, all right?
So fuck off before I put a bullet through your head.
Fuck! Arghh!
Oh, God!
Stop screaming!
Who is the cunt who shot me?
This one?
-He shot me. -I don't give a shit.
What's so fucking funny?
-No, nothing. -Nothing.
Well, you...
Yeah.
-And he...
Yeah?
N-no,
nothing.
Nothing.
Good.
'Cos I didn't think there was anything funny.
Did you?
No, not at all.
Do you guys?
-No. -No.
Good.
Really fucked in the head.
No...
No.
I don't, X, I don't.
-Oh, who, us? -Mhm.
We didn't.
Sorry...
Sir?
Hey...
chill, OK?
No need to call me "sir".
Just relax, yeah? I'm not your teacher.
OK?
So, boys...
My partner and I,
Yeah, you said that, but given you're in his house,
I think that's a bit weird, don't you?
Yeah, new ones as well.
You could break them in.
Or...
Listen, man, we don't know where he is, OK?
Where's his stuff?
Hey, what, you guys saying something?
Awesome.
Where's that?
Wait!
-What? -Back away from the door.
-What, why? -Just do it.
OK. What's going on?
I just remembered. What's the name of that movie?
You know, the one with the Black guy with the purple lightsaber?
-He's in it? -What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, him. Him.
-The one who says "fuck" every two words. -[Laughter]
What's it about?
-Kevin Bacon? -No, not Kevin Bacon.
He's in Footloose, you idiot.
-He means John Travolta. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, him.
-Fuck, X. -Hold on. Give me a minute, I'm trying to think.
and he shoots and he doesn't hit.
So if there was a fourth guy,
Out with Alex.
Get up.
Why?
Y: Get up!
Come on.
Move!
Come on.
Move!
What?
What?
What?
What's with the face?
What face?
What face?
Listen, I wasn't born yesterday, OK?
What's with the fucking face?
It's nothing.
Really.
What's in the briefcase?
Oh, erm, like money.
Erm, like, erm, m-m-money?
What the fuck?
-We didn't even know it was there. -Yeah, we're peaceful people.
You killed the bad guy, and let me say,
Really nice to meet you.
Seriously, we should hang out. Do lunch.
[Whispers]: Actually.
On second thought.
C'mon, X.
They were just honest,
peaceful people.
RICHTER: Just tell them to fuck off, then!
Find another channel. I don't care, do I?
Just get it done.
No, you work for me.
It's a full-time job, McArthur. Tell your wife to fuck off.
Right. OK, whatever.
Cunt.
-How's business, Frank? -Quite all right, actually.
I'm quite busy.
Got practically the entire House of Commons to yourself.
Well, I don't forget old friends.
Wow. We certainly hope not.
I-I can explain.
But you decided to marry her. Mistake number one.
You know how much he hates sharing her.
And now, to top it all off, you fucking lost her and the kids, too.
All alone in the world with no one to care for them.
I can explain.
I have people on it.
People?
Police. People in high places.
Two, not so much.
Calling the police, that's strike number three.
Big mistake.
You have become a problem, Frank.
can do your job for us nowadays.
And so you're more like a cute pet we keep.
He kept you because he liked you.
You're kind and effective, and you kept to yourself.
But fucking his daughter was bad business.
But no,
I loved her.
That's even worse, Frank.
No, you won't.
You died the day you married her.
If you want to shoot me, now's your chance.
You can't hide, Frank.
Not if it means going against him.
So how about it?
Put your gun down.
Great.
You should really background check your employees
The things you can get into this building.
Don't be sad it's ending, Frank.
Just be happy you were there for the ride.
Save me a seat in hell.
[Echoey]: Yes.
Of course, sir.
No worries.
Will do.
-What? -The movie, I remembered. It was Pulp Fiction.
What?
-Wait, X, X, X, X, X, wait, wait. -She slapped me first.
-Y: She's a child. -B-b-b-but...
Go and stand outside.
Come on.
What?
-Where's Alex? -Who are you?
I'm a friend of your brother's, OK?
X! Stop!
Sorry.
Call the cleaners.
'Kay.
Really,
I'm a friend of your brother's, OK?
Like a knight.
Prove it.
He loves you very much and talks about you all the time.
That's so vague.
He has a huge birthmark on his right butt cheek.
How do you even know that?
That's besides the point. Where is Alex?
to see Mummy
But that was so long ago.
like Mum always said we would.
OK, buddy.
Don't worry.
I promise.
OK.
X, come here.
No way.
I'm not going with him. He smells funny.
-What's wrong? -Nothing. It's just...
-Leave it. Leave it -Quiet.
-X: Nothing like that, -Y: I don't like men, I like tits and pussy...
Sorry, not with me.
Hypothetically speaking, am I not good enough for you?
I'd do you.
And you'd enjoy it.
I just meant like work partners.
Yes, of course we are. That's what I meant.
-Yes. Yes. -Work partners.
Yeah, exclusively.
Very good work partners. Yeah.
Go with him.
You can trust him.
He's a friend.
OK.
Take good care of her. OK?
[Snaps] Hey...
and take the guns.
Yeah, of course.
-OK? -Mhm...
Then I'll be down.
-Yeah, cool, cool, cool. -Don't leave without me.
-X: Mhm. -Protection, remember, OK? Protection.
Fuck.
So, Alex...
How are you feeling?
Where's Mama?
-Yes? -Good morning, my name is Kevin and I'm with Octopus Energy.
We're calling today to inquire about your current energy provider.
-What? -Good morning, my name is... -No, stop. I don't care
But our limited-time offer provides you unlimited voltage for only £70 a month, sir.
And if you sign up within the next 24 hours,
we also send you a special-edition kitchen set
-for all your cooking necessities. -Oh wow,
that's really...
Will you give me just a second?
OK, bye now.
Bye. No, bye. Fuck off, Kevin.
Fuck off!
Mr Banksbi, sir.
No sir, I'm sorry sir,
I thought it was someone else.
No, Mr Banksbi, I don't. Thank you.
Still nothing.
In the apartment, sir.
Of course. Yes, sir.
No problem.
Goodbye.
Where's Mama Bear?
I already told you.
No, you lied to me.
Yes, she is.
Hey, how you doing? Welcome to Morley's. How can I help you?
What's good, boss man? You right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can I get two chicken combo meals, is that OK?
Yeah, that's OK.
Yeah. Two chicken combo meals and two orange sodas.
Two orange sodas, blud.
Great. That'll be £7.98.
What?
-You like chicken? -Yeah, it's very good.
Yeah, it is, innit? You see round here it is so much more than that.
London.
It's about your ends, about your community, right?
If you grew up in London, it's in your DNA.
You got Sam's, Morley's, Dixie's, Chicken Hut,
Chicken Valley, Chicken Cottage, Chicken Palace, Angel Fried Chicken,
Hackney Fried Chicken, White Chapel Fried Chicken.
-Wow. -Yeah.
and street lights.
No, you want the real London.
This is where it's at.
Two combo menus and two orange sodas.
Wait here.
Look at this!
Wait.
Take these.
I'll take these.
You do it.
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
Salt and pepper them chips.
Close it.
1-2-3...
Meaty.
-Hello. -Hi.
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.
She says we were just cleaning up.
This?
Yes, but what is "this"?
-Huh? -She says we were paid to clean this up.
It's a job. We clean up jobs.
I'm afraid I can't disclose those details. Contractually obligated to keep to myself.
-[Gibberish] -Right.
Where's the kid?
What kid? There is no kid.
Hey, I'm asking about the kid. Who the fuck cares what you had for lunch?
That's what I was saying.
I already told you,
Tell me who did this or I will fucking kill this bitch.
God! Jesus. Fuck me!
Oh, fuck!
-She doesn't like that word. -God!
Which word? "Bitch"? Fuck you, bitch.
Jesus... Fuck you.
Fuck you.
F-f-f...
God.
Listen, mister, we don't want any trouble.
-Open your mouth. -What?
-Open your fucking mouth. -OK.
-Are you OK? -Shut up.
Let me think.
Well, everything can be bought.
What?
I could tell you who did this if you pay us.
Yes.
Yes.
Wow, OK. That was easy.
Right.
OK. Now you have your money.
So tell me who did this.
[Muffled]: Untie me.
Untie me!
-Untie me fucker! -Look who woke up!
-Fuck you! -Good morning Cinderella, -Untie me!
-Hey Y, look who woke up! -Untie me!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Untie me!
Untie me!
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you, fucker. Fuck you.
Fuck you.
-Guess not. -Fucker.
Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
Fuck you, OK! I don't need this shit,
Stop!
What would you know about that?
But you don't strike me as someone who's actually...
dangerous.
Oh, I am dangerous.
Oh yeah?
Like what?
Yazuhiro Kazu
I killed him.
The Yakuza boss?
with my bare hands.
All by myself.
Wow.
Oh, he's not the only one.
The Ramirez cartel? Took them down all by myself.
Wow, those are some big clients.
What now?
A woman.
With an eye patch.
Hold his face.
What? No.
Hey, stop! That's an invasion of privacy.
Hey, this is private. Don't look to my pictures.
It's a meme.
What?
No, not this. This.
Where is Alex?
You know this pussy?
-Where is he? -Mate, your breath stinks.
Woah, hey no, OK chill. OK, chill.
I tell you where he is. They don't pay me enough anyway.
In a storage unit underneath the docks.
Which one?
Fuck OK, no, fine.
Number 24. The key is in my jacket.
No, please don't leave me here alone with these two...
Let's all be friends, OK?
Your daughter?
See? I'm more like a cool uncle. Right, buddy?
Totally.
So she's your niece?
Sort of...
Not really...
say?
-We need to go. -No, please.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Hey, don't you use those bad words now.
She probably wouldn't tell anyone.
Seemed like a nice lady.
Buddy? Fuck!
Buddy! Arghhh!
Kid!
I lost her already!
Oh, we were such great friends.
Y: X.
Y?
Y.
I lost her. I lost the kid.
-Thank you. -No problem.
X: Wassup you little ugly-ass bitch!
-Wassup, wassup! -Y: Hey!
What are you doing?
You know this guy?
-Yes, that's Alex. -This is Alex?
This is the motherfucker who punched me in the face, like five years ago.
-This is the fuck who killed my partner. -No, he didn't.
I did.
What?
Actually, he didn't. She's not dead.
You're not serious.
What?
Just give me the gun.
One gun.
OK. Stay safe.
-X, I'm not your mum. -OK.
Sorry.
Mummy.
ALEX: Coming.
Coming...
Oh, it's you.
Come in, come in.
Michael, this is...
but she works for my grandad.
Nice to meet you.
Come on, take a seat. We're all friends here.
As you wish.
I think you said something like...
Two grams?
Very mysterious.
I like it.
Ooh, I sense some tasty sexual tension.
Fiery.
Where did you get this?
It's mine. You can tell Grandpa it's not his.
Where did you get it?
Michael, man knows the best dealers.
He's a beast.
What?
It's unmistakable.
-[Gunshot] -Oh, my fucking God!
You know how much he hates stealing.
He didn't steal nothing.
Think again.
Don't move a muscle.
Run! Go, go, go!
Fuck!
X, get him.
Huh?
Hey!
-Fuck! -Oh, sorry, mate, did that hurt? Yeah?
Ow.
Svetlana!
No, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, hey!
Oh fuck.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Come on.
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.
all the colours of the rainbow, yeah?
Hey, don't worry. Let me sort this out.
I'm talking to you, old man!
No, you listen to me, you fuck!
and I can't control my own fucking grandson.
No.
with enough friends to fuck your ass year round.
What!?
Jonas on the phone, sir.
They're working on her now.
Right here with me?
No, sir.
I understand.
Like always, sir.
Thank you.
Oil the machine.
I'm sorry, X.
Thank you.
Just go.
Good morning, darling.
Good.
Come.
Sit.
Sugar?
One, thank you.
Clean?
Like always.
And the security tapes?
-Odd. -Yes, he blends in well, doesn't he?
Wonderful.
I hate giving away valuable things to people who don't deserve them.
Drink.
-He said the police were on it. -Oh, are they now? Isn't that lovely?
-I have some people on it. -So they found them?
-Yes. -Are they OK?
No, no.
I really messed up with my little girl.
Or maybe I loved her too much.
Not by any man.
Not with this little one.
She's all mine.
BANKSBI: Ah, Jonas.
Come in. Come in.
JONAS: Mr Banksbi,
-you sent for me? -BANKSBI: Yes, yes, of course.
Tea?
How's your leg, Jonas?
Yeah, it's OK. Healing well.
We need you ready for battle.
Ah, wonderful.
Put that there on the chair and the biscuits with me.
Wonderful. You can go.
The, er...
Yes.
Right there in the middle, please.
Do you like the new rug?
Yes, it's beautiful.
I prefer this one. Brings out the red.
Jonas.
Yes.
How did the job go?
Yeah, it went... well.
I, er...
Well, not the cleanest of methods, but everyone has their style.
Have you always done this?
JONAS: Yes.
BANKSBI: Have you ever missed one?
Er...
No.
Oh, good. Excellent, Jonas.
So you're not an idiot. Good to know.
Are you done?
Yes.
Wonderful. On your knees, please, Jonas.
What?
She won't help you, darling. She's not here for you.
On your knees, please.
Please. Please, I didn't do anything.
Oh, don't sell yourself short. You did more than enough.
On your knees.
I won't ask again.
You never told me.
But I'm going to tell you now, just once.
Because I like you.
What we sell or don't sell is completely irrelevant.
The key point is that the operation is successful.
Well, more or less.
Everybody has a function.
It's like a beautiful Swiss watch.
But if one little gear breaks,
the whole thing just stops.
So that my machine works.
You are a very important piece, Jonas.
We are a family, Jonas.
And I can't allow you to put my family at risk.
I really can't.
Please. Please, I'm sorry.
Whatever you did?
Remember five years ago,
Come on, think hard. I know you can do it.
there we are.
And he was still alive.
But you said that never happened.
is that you
Wouldn't you agree?
Please...
It won't happen again.
Please.
I'll do anything you want.
Forgive me.
BANKSBI: Lucy, dear,
Thank you.
Of course, of course. Come back when you're done.
Sure.
X: One, one, two, three.
X?
Svetlana?
Holy shit!
I thought you were dead.
My name's not Svetlana, X.
No. Yeah, no, of course. Sorry.
-They shot you in the... -I got lucky.
ass.
Sure.
I missed you so much, Mum. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy.
Mum. Mummy.
What are you doing here?
-What? -Long story.
Just tell him
to meet us at the abandoned train station in Croydon at 6
Is it done?
Thank you, X.
You have a lot of shit to explain, Y.
X: Move.
-I'm OK. -Good. They treat you well?
Yes.
ALEX: They're here.
You know the plan.
Where is she?
Safe.
What do you want, Alex?
Forever.
I'm not going to do that.
Please...
Oh...
Is that so?
You drove her insane, you know.
You're the reason she's gone.
BANKSBI: Give me the child, Alex.
I won't ask again.
She's gone, you know.
Mum.
She's gone.
And you think I'll let you have my sister?
No chance.
Is this it?
Enough!
No more of this shit.
Let's get to it!
Let's get to it!
The fuck is that?
-we're gonna fucking kill you. -Open Martin. Come out.
-Come out, you cunt! -Open up!
Come out, fatty.
What the fuck?
Fuck!
Martin!
What?
Don't talk back at me.
These boxes, back room.
Now!
Now!
It's fucking jarring, you know, why'd you do it?
Quit fucking staring at me, while you slurp on my fucking beer, man?
Fucking weird! Even saying that shit's fucking weird.
Quit being fucking weird!
I swear because I fucking wanna swear.
I swear because it's what I've always done.
Now...
staring.
Now, that's rude.
That's what's fucking rude.
No, not swearing.
Everybody swears, it's human nature.
D'ya know what?
I bet you even the Queen says a good "fuck you" every now and again.
You think the Queen... says the F word?
Come on, we don't have all day, move!
Hey, there's...
There's no rat here.
Check again.
So that's £12 for the full English, £10 for the pancakes,
-and... -X: £3.25 for the drink.
I'll pay cash.
It's just I reckon I can carry even more coins.
Ayo...
This place...
What are you doing?
None... of your business.
They are incredibly easy to access.
What?
X: Oi! Holy shit, hey!
What's your problem?
These are dangerous weapons.
Don't talk back at me.
Move! [Rezips]
X: Fuck!
MARTIN: Well isn't that adorable.
Wow, OK, Mort, calm down.
-Let's talk this out, yeah? -Nah, we will not talk anything out.
Fingertips...
slowly.
-[Gun rattles] -Kick it over.
Please, not in front of her.
Fine. Let's go.
Hey, look.
Don't move.
Hey...
Come on, man. Not here, please. She can still see us.
MARTIN: Alright, move.
-Fucking hell, Mort! -On your knees.
Get down!
The fuck is that?
Nothing. That's nothing, man.
Now don't fuck with me. Alright, c'mon, move.
-It's complicated, man. -BANKSBI: Enough!
Listen, Mort, these are bad people.
You do not want to fuck with them.
No, man. I'm going to rid the world of all you fucking criminals.
BANKSBI: Let's get to it.
-X? -Hey.
Where's my sister?
You've got the kid?
Nobody fucking move or I'll kill him, alright?
What if I shoot you?
You wouldn't dare.
Listen to me, Martin. You don't want to do this.
Shut the fuck up!
Is now a bad time?
-Let go of her! -Give me my sister.
How did you escape?
I have my ways.
Enough.
Hand her over.
Yeah, about that.
This job got really fucking complicated.
I had to jump through hoops for you. My fare has gone up.
I'm not paying you a penny more.
Up to you. I want more money or I kill this kid.
No! Svetlana, please do something.
There's nothing I can do, X.
Yes, you can. You owe them.
X: Alex saved your life.
They saved your life!
Like hell they did.
They almost killed me.
They called Jonas and his men.
-They're the reason you're alive. -Shut your mouth, boy.
I saved her.
You!
Hand my granddaughter to me
right this fucking moment.
Look like there's only one way to solve this.
You...
shot me.
You lied to me.
You think they'll love you?
You're not their mother.
You're right.
She's dead.
You won't find her where you're going.
Rest in peace, Mort.
You shot him.
Glad you're OK.
It's just a scrape.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
I think I'll go away for a while.
I have some savings.
Barbados, maybe.
You?
I think I'll stay here.
X: Yeah.
I'll miss you, man.
Me too.
Good luck.
Hey, come here.
X, please don't go.
Retire.
Sun on my face, drink in my hands.
No?
But I need you.
You, erm...
You don't need someone like me in your life.
No.
Now,
listen to your brother
and the serious lady, OK.
Be good.
For me.
I'll miss you.
X: Yeah...
me too.
Hey...
Go on.
Hey, X...
wait up.
I'm coming with you.
EHRENGARD THE ART OF SEDUCTION
Please sit still, Your Grace.
If so, it was not conscious.
Remain still.
Is something wrong?
I got the impression that the Grand Duke wanted me to… imprison your beauty.
In that case, one can't be petty.
So.
You are stopping?
This is taking an eternity.
Yes.
-A true portrait takes time. -Yes, I have observed.
Like a seduction.
Mr. Cazotte.
Miss Zimmermann.
Mr. Cazotte!
-Rent is overdue. If you don't pay… -My dear Madam, my dear Madam…
And it's on its way. Trust me. It's coming.
Smile. It's a lovely day. All is good.
Thank you for having me.
I am delighted. Most delighted.
Thank you.
The painter.
The painter?
And then nothing like her.
Interesting. You said, "And then nothing like her."
I believe that art should be more than just lifelike.
My daughter.
-Your daughter? -Yes.
You look so troubled. Not enjoying it here?
Very much, Your Grace.
Please tell me who you are gazing at.
Hearing about the passions of living beings. And all the details.
A young madam.
-Where? -There.
-Ehrengard. -She is lovely.
-A rather forbidding family. -So I gathered, yes.
Did she like the portrait? Was she spellbound by your ability?
I wouldn't say that precisely.
A new portrait?
We need your help.
My husband isn't a direct descendant.
Count Marbod.
Yes, it's so sad.
My son stands to inherit the throne,
but he isn't married, so he can't inherit it.
Maybe under different circumstances, but…
And how am I to help, Your Grace?
Observe my son.
[Grand Duchess] Look at the young Prince, and the ladies around him. They flock.
But he barely looks at them. Not so much as a smile.
Prince Lothar must find a wife soon,
or else the throne will be given to…
[Grand Duchess] …my husband's cousin.
-[stammering] Just to… Yes. -[Grand Duchess] Mr. Cazotte. Your task…
Your craft must be to awaken my son's rapture.
His [in french] belle passion.
But I must insist you are rewarded for your efforts.
Very well.
I'll try my best.
-Naturally, Your Grace.
Keep the rest.
My name is Cazotte. I am an artist.
I mean you no harm, My Lord.
Forgive me, but you looked a little sad standing over there.
-They want me to marry. -[Cazotte] Who?
My mother and father.
-Everyone. -No.
[Cazotte] No.
with all due respect, of course… have misunderstood something?
is actually liberating freedom.
Allow me to show you some sketches, My Lord.
[Cazotte] From my love life.
[Cazotte] You like that one. It's yours. Keep it.
what I told him during those days and nights.
[Cazotte] I recited passages from both "Decameron" and "The Canterbury Tales",
about silky rose petals, swelling hearts intoxicated with blood,
-An outing? -To the castle in Leuchenstein.
I'm painting a family portrait there. I'd like to bring the Prince,
introduce him to the daughters. Not without your permission, of course.
Apart from the youngest.
-Ludmilla. -But she's still a child.
Not any longer, Your Grace. She turns 18 next week.
So?
And you know the family well?
I painted their portraits, a long time ago, yes.
Only their portraits?
Your Grace, what do you think of me?
And dress like some peasant?
No. As my pupil. But yes, anonymity.
You can weigh up Ludmilla without the burden of your title.
She is like the rose whose rich fragrance innocently
lures the passer-by to pluck the bloom.
But no one has picked it so far.
the knees,
the ankles.
[Cazotte] We must however make one minor adjustment.
[Cazotte] Princess Ludmilla, you have bloomed with such swiftness.
Mama, Papa, may I?
Now, let's see.
-I'm blushing. -[Cazotte] Don't.
[Cazotte] And pardon me…
Isn't he handsome?
[Cazotte] Handsome and with a gifted soul. He finds beauty where no one else does.
That's talent.
In fact, it was his idea to refine your portrait.
[Cazotte] "You're not doing her justice.
She hides even greater beauty." He said that.
-He didn't say that. -He did.
And I had to agree.
-No. -Yes.
He's of noble extraction.
Like yourself.
-Mine? -[Cazotte] No, no. Well.
-No! -[Cazotte] Two frisky puppies!
[Ludmilla] Come.
They walked the castle garden.
[Lothar] Come.
You are a genius, Mr. Cazotte.
You have done our lineage a great service.
-[Cazotte] Please know that. -Yes.
Yes.
[Grand Duchess] Count yourself lucky I didn't mention your name. He was incensed.
-But the wedding ceremony. -Yes.
My son's wedding. You must accept the invitation. I insist.
[priest] Accept these blessed and consecrated rings.
which you have together made here today.
I claim you to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I claim you to be my lawfully wedded husband.
[priest] Amen.
[priest] All who are gathered here today
[priest] Amen.
[soldier] And… halt!
Mr. Cazotte. Pack your belongings and come with us.
You seem upset.
-[Cazotte] Yes? -Yes.
Pardon. I'm trying to say
that not one of your faithful subjects would fail to smile in their hearts
upon hearing of the matter that vexes you. For everyone loves a loving couple.
I already told you how difficult it's been to keep Babenhausen in our hands.
-Oh, because of cousin… -Marbod.
Living in sin may pass muster in your creative circles,
but in ours it's a death sentence.
Prince Lothar will be disinherited
-[Grand Duchess] In hiding? -[Cazotte] Yes. That should be possible.
In the dark?
[Cazotte] His eyes, nothing else.
I think I have found a plan to solve this.
[Court Marshal] …in September.
-You'll also see to the decor? -Yes.
-Oh. -Oh, less sure already?
No, Your Grace. It just dawned on me
that Princess Ludmilla will need a special lady-in-waiting.
-Someone we can trust. -[Grand Duchess] Of course.
that it would justify her selection.
-Agreed? -Yes, of course.
The Princess, in her isolation, will need an associate of a similar
age and temperament as herself.
You're doing it again. You talk and talk…
-Ehrengard. -My goodness. Yes.
You mean to seduce her.
No!
You are right.
who understands the artist.
Excuse me, but may I tell you what I'm thinking?
Yes.
I see her.
[Cazotte] I see her.
[Cazotte] And this is precisely why, like Michelangelo, I exclaim,
"Within that block of marble, is my greatest triumph buried."
Michelangelo, block of marble, warrior in a white frock aside,
practically Puritans. All military people.
You won't get near her.
-You have been too ambitious this time. -Maybe so.
Yet I do not fret.
Then a wager may be put into play.
A wager of?
Ehrengard won't surrender to you.
And if she does?
[Grand Duchess] If you win Ehrengard, I offer you lifelong employment at court.
If she doesn't?
Very well.
not even the Grand Duke.
[Schreckenstein] But please tell me,
Mr. Cazotte.
…young Valkyrie.
Brought up under the strictest military virtues.
…flaming sword to stand guard over the young lovers' paradise.
I get beside myself. I find Ehrengard's strength impressive.
-[grins] -Stop this stupidity.
[Schreckenstein] Ehrengard. Pack your things.
Of course, Father.
-Just one thing. -[Schreckenstein] Yes?
May I bid Kurt farewell?
Kurt?
My fiancé, Your Grace.
Yes, for certain. You may bid your fiancé farewell.
You are a good girl. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Cazotte?
-Yes. Absolutely. -Yes.
Yes, sleep very well, Ehrengard.
What a pompous charlatan.
-I have found a secluded place. -Yes?
Rosenbad.
-Rosenbad? -Yes.
-It's been unoccupied for generations. -Precisely.
[servant] Welcome.
He'll remain here to keep a constant check on the Princess' health.
[Grand Duchess] Our riding master, Mr. Podolski.
[Grand Duchess] And our excellent Chief Lady-in-waiting, Countess Poggendorf.
And Ehrengard.
Ehrengard you know.
[Cazotte] Onto the entrance hall. Do keep these doors shut to prevent a draft.
-[Poggendorf] Mr. Cazotte? -Yes?
-May I ask you something? -Naturally.
-Mr. Cazotte. -Yes.
-Yes? -At the grand ball.
You were standing by your portrait of the Grand Duchess.
Offend me?
And we smile.
I tried to create a place
-Are these for me? -Yes, they are.
-Thank you. -Pleasure.
[Lothar] Cazotte.
[Cazotte] Our little court has quickly settled into the romantic atmosphere.
That's what a soldier must do.
I have taught him fencing. Everyone in our family masters it.
[Ehrengard] Yes. Many times.
[Ehrengard] You are up early.
Yes. Well, I usually am.
Are you going riding?
-[Ehrengard] If you want to ride alone… -No.
No. No, it's fine, uhm… I think I…
I think I can.
-Good morning, Mr. Podolski. -Good morning, Mr. Cazotte.
Same horse?
Just any.
Yes, sir.
Just ride ahead. I'll catch up.
-[Ehrengard] Alpenglow? -Yes. Alpenglow.
It's already vanishing.
[Cazotte] Yes. Naturally.
[Cazotte] A clear day will follow. It's a miracle.
Your own horse?
Yes. Indeed. And yours isn't?
His name is Wohtan.
Only I can ride him.
I can imagine.
Mr. Cazotte.
-Someone's coming. -So turn them away.
We're visiting the Princess. I'm the Grand Duke's cousin.
You will have to come back another day.
The Princess' condition, as you can imagine, prevents her from seeing anyone.
Are you refusing me entry?
-I'm only a messenger. -I insist.
-[Cazotte] Listen… -Who do you think I am?
-[Cazotte] I'm just… -Move!
Marbod.
What a surprise.
It's but a short visit.
-But… -[Lothar] Goodbye.
[Marbod] Lothar. Dearest Lothar. It's just a very short visit.
-Did you see his lies? -Obviously.
We must remain close by.
Do you know anyone employed at the fine castle?
Perhaps you could reconsider your stance a little more carefully?
[Cazotte] I know that, given the nature of the situation, you cannot visit us,
[Cazotte] Let me begin by telling you some happy news.
[Cazotte] And it immediately hit me
[Cazotte] But it was something else.
and I beg Your Grace not to see this as explicit or think of me as a voyeur.
the entire magical atmosphere
simply cried out to be immortalized in art.
"Nymph Bathing in a Forest Lake."
[Cazotte] Or "Diana's Bath", would in itself be a wonder,
a glory, the crowning moment of my career as an artist.
fastening and fixing upon my canvas every line and hue of her young body,
[Cazotte] So I wait.
[Cazotte] Instead, I approach her in other ways.
[Ehrengard] Wohtan. Hi.
Hi.
…for my heart.
-Ehrengard. -Hi.
-[Kurt] I missed you… -But we can't meet this way.
But why?
Perhaps someday I can tell you everything.
Farewell, my friend.
[Ludmilla] Yes.
Ehrengard! The waters have broken.
Not quite yet.
Mr. Podolski, send for the Grand Duchess.
First, the castle trembled with fear,
Mr. Cazotte. Be honest.
Is he healthy?
Come.
[Lothar] Come.
[Grand Duchess] Congratulations.
Even I, Your Grace, someone not prone to sentimentality,
And Ehrengard. How is it going with her?
She has for the first time, unbeknownst to herself,
completely fallen in love.
-Already? -[Cazotte] Mm.
Not with me, Your Grace. With your grandchild.
-Oh! -Yes.
-Yes. -Oh… Oh no.
No, no, no. On the contrary. It serves my purpose perfectly.
I sense you are grasping at straws.
[Lothar] Mama.
-Your coach awaits. -Yes.
Leaving already?
-And you, Lothar? -Of course, Mother.
-And she is reliable? -[Cazotte] Yes. We made inquiries.
[man] Lisbeth, please come home sometimes. How am I to care for myself?
-Lisbeth? -Go!
Lisbeth? Can…
[man] Lisbeth. Lisbeth!
Lisbeth!
-You took your time. -I'm sorry.
I've made inquiries, but no news. Rosenbad has been completely quiet.
Then why send for us?
-[taverner] Brandy? -Go on.
Then let's hope it is good.
-The court has employed someone new. -Keep going.
A woman.
-And what else? -A woman with small children.
You should talk to him.
Excuse us.
What can you tell of Rosenbad?
It's all one big lie.
then…
My good man.
There's already a baby at the castle.
I have a job for you.
-Possession of? -[Marbod] Yes.
And as thanks for your heroic achievements,
once my wife and I take over the throne.
Good.
[Ehrengard] Mr. Cazotte.
[Cazotte] Yes.
Yes, last night was the shortest night.
And on this shortest night I'm in the fresh air.
-[Ehrengard] Ritual? -Yes.
in its most tremulous moment.
-Tremulous? -Where it is most fecund.
[Ehrengard] It sounds rather sad.
nettles with their burning embrace, the forest lake with its gentle caresses.
-I'm just thinking out loud. -Let me see it.
-[Cazotte] No, I'm just thinking out loud. -Yes.
[Podolski] Mr. Cazotte!
Mr. Cazotte.
Pardon me.
I made sure they won't enter Rosenbad, and hear the child.
-We'll have a picnic. -When?
-This Sunday? -There's no way out, no.
We must hide the child.
-And Ludmilla should be… -Six months pregnant. Sizeable.
Lisbeth must stay here with the child,
and everyone else must be carefully instructed.
[Cazotte] Yes.
[Cazotte] Well, as you know I have painted her every morning.
Why doesn't that silly fool just
seduce the girl the old-fashioned way and set his mind at rest?
…an artist.
I could seduce the girl the old-fashioned way, and it'd be less difficult.
I could seduce her at a given moment, where her soul is agitated, impulsive.
By no means. I still intend to seduce her, Your Grace.
And that is genuine seduction.
She will become the rose, its petals are shed
Once the passion has conquered the soul, the body follows after.
When she sees the painting, she will simply be astonished… and succumb.
She will succumb? Our Ehrengard?
Should I ready your horse, Miss Ehrengard?
Now I've… made a terrible mistake.
He promised me I would get my Lisbeth back if I helped him.
I've made a terrible mistake.
Now I have to help.
Tomorrow…
Listen.
Proceed as agreed.
Understand me?
-What? -[Ehrengard] Proceed as agreed.
And keep Lisbeth unaware.
It will work out if you listen to me.
Here I am.
You look pale. Are you feeling crestfallen?
We still need chairs.
[Ehrengard] Cazotte?
Ehrengard.
The lake?
I always knew you were there.
…you to complete the painting.
[Ehrengard] But I was thinking…
…we might do it in your chamber.
Because to be closer might help.
Directly facing.
Yes.
Naturally. Yes.
Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely.
Close your eyes.
And visualize it.
Yes…
[Ehrengard] Good.
-Arrange everything. -[Cazotte] Mm.
-Yes. -Yes.
Yes.
[whispers] Cheers.
Dear Marbod.
It is an immense pleasure to…
Yes, I think you just said that.
And I am delighted…
…that Princess Ludmilla is feeling well enough to be with us today.
-[Cazotte] It is wonderful. -And… the weather…
Cheers.
-Delightful wine. Very strong. -[Grand Duchess] Very. Pearly light.
-Crayfish? -No, thank you.
Snap, snap.
-Not too hot or cold. Just right. -[Cazotte] Lovely weather.
Matthias!
No. You…
Yes.
This comedy has gone on long enough.
Yes.
So full of life.
[Orsyla] So soft.
Come on my good man.
Yes, come, Matthias.
-[Marbod] Come. -[Lisbeth] Stop!
[Marbod] Matthias, come.
[Lisbeth] Matthias!
Excuse me.
[Lisbeth] Matthias!
[Lisbeth] Mat…
[Lisbeth] Matthias! Stop!
[Lisbeth] Matthias, stop it!
[Lisbeth] Matthias!
Come.
No!
No, no, no!
[Cazotte] Come on. Stop! Wait!
-Move! -I'm going as fast as I can.
Come on.
[Ehrengard] Giddy-up!
[Ehrengard] You there!
Stop! That's enough!
[Matthias] It is very unjust of this woman to attack me.
Well.
It was a good try otherwise, dear cousin.
[Ehrengard] I don't understand. This child here is mine.
That child is hers.
Say it again.
No. Yes.
-[Ehrengard] I can assure you it is. -Yes.
Ask Lisbeth. She will confirm.
That is not true.
-Yes. -Yep.
[Ehrengard] Cazotte.
Yes.
Well. You must prove it.
Should we wait for him to grow older,
so we can see if he takes after his father?
We are not fools!
Evidence! I demand evidence.
-Cazotte. -Yes?
Show them your notebook.
[Cazotte] Hm?
[Cazotte] It's necessary… Yes.
I don't have…
-[Ehrengard] Yes. -No.
[Cazotte] Yes.
Ehrengard.
Kurt?
-Not now. Not now! -What about…
No.
Is that enough?
Shh. Come. Come
[Ehrengard] Shh. Come.
Tomorrow at dawn.
[Ehrengard] Kurt!
-Would you like to choose first? -No. You go ahead.
Very well.
Help him.
Are you ready?
Pardon me, but I don't understand why we can't discuss this like adults.
Twenty steps. Or fewer perhaps?
Twenty steps.
One. Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve. Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
I've been hit. I've been hit!
[Ehrengard] Stop!
[Ehrengard] Wait!
[everyone] Amen.
[Cazotte] Here ends the story of Ehrengard.
an order given in recognition
[Cazotte] I was present, but received no order.
Yes.
[Grand Duchess] Yes! Yes!
[Cazotte] Here I received many prestigious assignments
where I could further develop my great artistic talent.
[Cazotte] They called me…
[Cazotte] …Casanova.
<i>which means Adventure City should get a good look at tonight's meteor shower.</i>
<i>You're listening to Adventure City radio.</i>
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Hank! Phone!
Okey-doke. (GRUNTS)
Yell-o. Hello?
Weird. There's nobody there.
Hello? Hello? (GRUNTS) What on earth?
The door's locked.
There's somebody outside.
What? Where? Look. Over there.
HANK: What are they doing?
Oh, my goodness. They're heading straight for the welding tanks!
Hello? PAW Patrol? This is Janet from J&H Scrap. (CRASHING)
The whole place is burning down!
You've got to come quick!
Skye, you are clear for takeoff.
Let's take to the sky!
And away we go!
The entrance is blocked. I'm gonna clear a way in.
Hot dog! It's the PAW Patrol! They're gonna save us!
They're cute little puppies who drive around in cars.
I know that sounds weird, but just go with it.
Arf! Water cannon!
Help! Help!
BOTH: Help us!
Marshall, the trailer's on fire!
I'm all out of water!
Oh, no. SKYE: Incoming!
ALL: Yeah, Skye!
You see that right there? That's why she's my favorite pup.
Let's get you out of there.
(GRUNTING) Whoa!
Oh!
Oops. Sorry.
We're just glad you're okay. Hopefully there's not too much damage.
These are the brave pups I was telling you about.
This is Bruce. He's a sensitive soul.
This is all a bit much for him.
Oh, great idea.
I'm fine down here. Come here, sweetie.
Everybody say, "Junk."
Ugh! I hate being the smallest pup.
That trailer was locked from the outside. How did that happen?
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but somebody locked us up
It's showtime.
I'm Sam Stringer here, reporting live from downtown Adventure City,
ALL: (CHANTING) Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!
Ah, I'm just so excited to see the meteor, Chickaletta.
and everyone is turning their eyes to the sky.
All I can see is your giant head.
Oops. Sorry.
Come on, Rubble. You're gonna miss the meteor.
I do?
You're all growing so fast.
All of us? Even me?
Not yet, Skye. You're still pretty much the same size.
But it's nothing to worry about. All pups grow at their own speed.
And some of us never grow at all.
Oh, great. They're here.
Nano. Hello!
Mini. Hi!
And Tot. What's up?
(GASPS) You're Chase.
Uh, yep.
You're on the case.
And you're Rubble! (YELPS)
Cool glasses. Thank you.
Wow, Skye, I'm almost as tall as you!
Whoa! My turn, my turn!
This thing is expensive.
Oops. Whoops.
Sorry.
Let's try that again.
I don't know about this whole "Junior Patrollers" thing.
I mean, when did the PAW Patrol become
Come on, Liberty.
Don't write them off just because they're small.
Whoa!
Look at all the stars.
There must be a billion of them.
We should count them all.
Okay.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Hello, world. Hello, universe. Hello, Internet!
My name is Victoria Vance,
that I'm the greatest scientist in history.
Oh, and don't believe the rumors.
I'm not a mad scientist.
and I am a scientist,
You got that? Good.
Now, I've been tracking meteor X-2805 for the past two years.
It contains some kind of power source
Which brings me to my latest invention, the Meteor Magnet!
This sweet little tractor beam
will pull that meteor out of the sky
Now, let's get ready to party.
I've locked on to the meteor and I'm reeling it in!
I did it. I did it!
Me. Victoria Vance.
To all the haters out there who laughed at me
No! No, no, no!
I don't have enough power!
That is not good.
NANO: ...3,034, 3,035,
3,036, 3,037, 3,038...
PUPS: Whoa.
It looks like it's headed straight for us.
Everybody out of the pup tower!
RYDER: Get those people inside! Go, go, go!
Everybody out of the street! You need to take cover right now!
Take shelter! The meteor's heading straight for us!
Everybody inside! Get inside!
Oh! Come on, buddy. Get up. Let's go.
Clear!
Street's clear!
Clear!
Good job, pups. Now take cover!
Get down!
Is everybody okay?
I'm okay.
I'm good.
I'm fine, but I'm gonna need a serious bath.
Oh, my goodness.
Wait. Where are the Junior Patrollers?
Nano? Mini? Tot?
BOTH: Whoa!
That was epic.
Oh, no. Look.
The pup tower. It's completely destroyed.
Our home. Our vehicles.
It's all gone.
RYDER: This meteor is giving off some kind of strange energy pulse.
I was there, people! I almost got squashed!
after taking credit for the disaster online.
<i>I did it! Me. Victoria Vance.</i>
Yikes. Ooh! That's an open and shut case.
You can't lock me up!
I heard that.
I am not a mad scientist!
Hello, roomie.
It looks like it stopped glowing.
Maybe that's a good thing. The glowing freaks me out.
Argh, come on.
Nope. No, I got it.
Good night, pups. If you need me, I'm just down the hall.
RUBBLE: Ryder? Yeah?
Rubble! (GASPS)
What is that?
Weird.
I didn't do it!
No way.
Whoa!
Looks like the smallest pup just became the strongest pup.
Whoa!
I think I've got superpowers.
No way.
This is the weirdest dream I've ever had.
Uh, Rubble, you're not dreaming.
Oh. Then this is the weirdest awake I've ever had.
(GASPS) Look at your paws.
Whoa.
Well, that makes sense. You're a fire pup.
I wonder what your power is.
Get over where? (YELPS)
shoots fireballs out of his paws.
Don't worry. I got it.
(LAUGHS) Dudes, I'm one with the water.
Awesome.
Huh?
Cool. I'm a wrecking ball.
Whoa, Rubble, are you okay?
Rock 'n' roll!
What's your power, Liberty?
Okay, come on. Here we go. Superpowers on three.
One, two, three.
Whoa! (GROANS)
That's because it's magnet paws!
Nope.
That's it. I'm a superpowered wrecking ball!
Yeah!
What's going on here? I've got no powers.
What a rip-off.
Zuma turns to water.
But I'm just Liberty.
What's my thing?
Now that we're super, we're gonna need a new name for ourselves.
Why do we need a new name? We're the PAW Patrol.
I know, but now we're more.
Ooh! I know.
How about we call ourselves
Ready for action, Ryder, sir!
ALL: Whoa!
Power paws!
<i>seven, six, five, four...</i>
(HOWLS) <i>...three, two, one,</i>
<i>go!</i>
Power paws!
<i>go!</i>
<i>Zuma, Rubble, ready for launch.</i>
(GRUMBLES) <i>Go!</i>
LIBERTY: Uh, Ryder?
I've been thinking about that, Liberty,
and I've got a very important mission for you.
Whatever you need, anything at all, I'm your pup.
Great. I need you to hang back and look after the Junior Patrollers.
I'm trying to be more flexible,
but I don't know the first thing about little kids.
Don't worry, Liberty. You'll be great at it.
Ryder, come back! I'm not built for babysitting!
Oh!
STRINGER: <i>When we hear the word "superpowers,"</i>
we usually think of big-budget Hollywood movies
But now we know superpowers are real.
Help!
That was my meteor.
Those should be my superpowers.
I can't stand the PAW Patrol either.
Yeah, well, don't get too attached.
As soon as I can find my way out of here,
Can you give us a minute?
with my colleagues.
Okay, here's the deal.
if you promise to share some of those superpowers with me.
It's only a deal if we shake on it.
Ugh.
We all shake on it.
Yeah. No, thanks. I'm good.
Don't be shy. Lift the lid.
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
<i>The Mighty Pups have incredible superpowers.</i>
<i>Skye can fly, Chase has super speed and Rubble is a real-life wrecking ball.</i>
Okay, no more messing around.
My superpower is fire paws!
Nope. Okay. Okay. That's okay.
It's super speed.
STRINGER: <i>Thanks to the superpowers contained in the mysterious meteor,</i>
<i>these pups are truly unstoppable.</i>
Come on, Liberty. Be flexible. Be flexible!
We're just sitting around watching.
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but are you three puffballs serious about joining the PAW Patrol one day?
Yes! Absolutely!
More than anything in the entire universe!
Then you guys are going to be my personal project.
ALL: Wicked!
...97, 98, 99, 100.
Your turn.
One... One...
Yeesh.
Let's do this!
<i>Go, go, go!</i>
Take it easy, Liberty.
Remember, the Junior Patroller program is just for fun.
Huh?
(SIGHS) You said that two miles ago.
Oh, stop complaining. Just be happy I broke you out of jail.
I'll be happy when I have something else to look at.
Is that Humdinger? What's he doing out of jail?
Stop campaigning. We're fugitives on the run.
Sorry. I forgot.
It's just so nice to be reunited with my adoring public.
Ha! I didn't vote for you.
Hmm! This is why I hate free and fair elections.
We just got to keep a low profile
And how do you propose we do that?
We give them the one thing they can't resist.
Air Humdinger. VICTORIA: It's perfect.
I had nightmares in jail about flying coach.
COMPUTER VOICE: <i>Autopilot activated.</i>
Now we just fly around until the PAW Patrol comes to rescue us.
And why would they do that? Because of this.
Are you out of your mind?
Whee!
What are you doing?
Now we're in trouble. They'll have to come rescue us!
That was your plan?
Uh-huh!
Now sit down and eat some cashews while I go yelp for help!
Did you see that?
They're getting it. These pups are legit.
I'm happy for you, Liberty, but maybe it's time for a break.
ALL: We don't need no stinking break!
Ha-ha! That's what I'm talking about, puffballs.
PAW Patrol. What's your emergency?
VICTORIA: <i>Mayday, mayday! This is flight HD9904.</i>
<i>We need immediate assistance.</i> Hang tight. We're on our way.
Skye, I need you to fly up there and carry that plane down safely.
I'm a Mighty Pup. I was made for this.
We'll provide ground support. Come on, pups.
Let's take to the sky!
Humdinger? (CACKLES)
Me. (CACKLING)
My crystal!
It's like taking candy from a baby.
Give that back.
(GRUNTING) Ooh!
No!
Ryder, come in. This is Skye.
It was a trap.
They stole my crystal, I've got no powers and this plane is going down.
I can't get a visual. Hang on.
Copy that. We'll have to improvise.
RYDER: Skye, we're clearing a runway.
I need you to set a course for Main Street.
That's the busiest street in Adventure City.
It's also the longest.
Arf! Flares! (TIRES SCREECHING)
I feel the need for super speed.
This intersection is closed!
I'm on final approach.
Oh, no.
I'm going under!
Whoa!
Oof! Okay, hard landing.
Now that's a nice parking job.
LIBERTY: They're back. Come on. They're back.
Awesome! Yeah!
How'd it go?
Not good.
How bad could it be? It was a trap.
Skye's crystal was stolen.
Oh.
So, really, really not good.
Hey, Skye. You doing okay?
I can't believe I lost my crystal.
It could have happened to any one of us.
But it didn't. It happened to me.
When I was born, I was the runt of the litter.
<i>And sometimes you're never picked at all.</i>
<i>I needed to take matters into my own hands.</i>
No! Come back!
I've got you. It's okay.
I had no idea.
When I had superpowers, for the first time in my life
Amazing. That's your best time yet!
I'm telling you, Ryder, these puffballs are the real deal.
Liberty, we've got to end the Junior Patroller program.
What? It's too dangerous.
Skye's superpowers have fallen into the wrong hands,
and we have no idea what's coming.
But the puffballs can help.
Sure, they're little, but I've heard you say,
"No pup's too small," like, a million times.
I know the Junior Patrollers mean the world to you,
Tell us what? (RYDER GASPS)
Nano, Mini, Tot, I've got some tough news.
I'm ending the Junior Patroller program.
What?
No. RYDER: I'm sorry.
When is that gonna be?
Ryder, I'm sorry I lost my crystal.
Don't be so hard on yourself. We're gonna get it back.
I've set the computer to scan the city sector by sector,
looking for the energy signature of the crystal.
Just say the word, I'm ready to go.
Skye, I'm gonna need you to stay behind on this mission.
What?
You don't have superpowers anymore.
But I have to do something.
Until we get that crystal back, I need you to stay here.
That's not fair.
I'm sorry, Skye. But my decision is final.
Try and get some rest.
Finally.
I wonder what my superpower will be.
Ooh!
Ow! Don't touch.
I have the power to control electricity.
For someone who hates being called a mad scientist,
I'm just gonna stand over here.
HUMDINGER: Stop that!
The static electricity is ruining my moustache.
And look what it's done to the kitties!
But now look at me.
I just need to make a few modifications,
Why on earth do you need more meteors?
Who knows what else is out there?
COMPUTER VOICE: <i>Energy signature detected.</i>
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>
(GASPS) My crystal.
If I'm gonna get my crystal back, I'm gonna need all the power I can get.
That's all of them.
I'll have these crystals back before anyone knows they're gone.
Gotcha. Switching engines to stealth mode.
VICTORIA: Oh, no, you don't!
Ta-ta.
Get back here!
Oh!
You're so predictable. Let me out of here!
Not so super inside a force field, are you?
Don't feel bad for losing.
Thanks for the crystals, though.
SKYE: No!
Ha!
This is incredible!
I can reach further into space than ever before.
Stop! What you're doing is dangerous.
People could get hurt.
And why should I care about other people? They never cared about me.
No matter how smart I was,
I promised myself I'd never let anyone
I'm sorry that happened to you.
Oh, what would you know about anything? You're just a dog.
I know what it's like to feel small and insignificant.
Like you have to work twice as hard as everyone else just to prove you belong.
Turns out I am too small to make a difference.
That was good. I know what you're trying to do.
We have a little bonding moment, I get all soft and blubbery,
Well, it's never gonna happen!
Who are you talking to? Ooh, is that Skye?
Humdinger.
Aren't they beautiful?
Ugh! Fine. A deal's a deal.
Oh! Oh! Ah!
I have so much to say!
HUMDINGER: Give me that crystal!
How do I turn this thing on? Come on, superpowers.
Wow!
Oh!
Those pups and I have got some unfinished business.
Oh, no.
Ryder! Ryder! Ryder!
Skye's gone. She took the crystals!
What?
The computer found the missing crystal.
Oh, no.
Looks like we're doing this the old-fashioned way.
Then I'm coming with you.
What was that?
MARSHALL: Earthquake!
I don't think that's an earthquake.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my old friends, the PAW Patrol.
Humdinger.
I'm stuck!
ROCKY: Gotcha. RYDER: Go!
ZUMA: Get out of the road!
What kind of heartless monster steps on an ice cream truck?
Ah, there's nothing better than a day at the salon.
LIBERTY: Arf! Sidecar!
Hey!
Hey, I know you. You're in the PAW Patrol.
I mean, not to do the rescues or anything, obviously,
Ew!
HUMDINGER: You're not getting away that easy.
Ugh!
Get back here!
Turn around!
I don't know. We're trapped!
Junior Patrol is on a roll!
It's the Junior Patrollers!
Ahhh!
NANO: Operation Allergies.
BOTH: Go!
He's gonna blow!
Marshall, the crystal's in his jacket pocket!
I'm on it.
Got it. HUMDINGER: Oh, no, you don't!
Marshall!
Ow!
Ooh, that's a hot one-liner.
Whoa! Whoa!
Humdinger, you're going back to jail.
Oh, not again.
Hop in, puffballs. You ride with me.
Nice work, Marshall. Let's take that crystal and go get Skye.
So many meteors, so little time.
Ooh!
Can't you read? The sign says "keep out"!
We're going door to door selling Pup Club cookies.
I'm listening. What do you got?
Vance is distracted at the door. Zuma, you're up.
Aye-aye, Ryder, sir.
NANO: We got plain, sprinkles, caramel...
VICTORIA: No. No. Pass. NANO: Spicy ginger...
VICTORIA: Ooh!
Surf's up.
We'll take your order now,
Skye? Skye? Where are you?
Zuma?
Power paws.
We're a team.
Fine. Have it your way.
Chase! Got it.
Marshall!
Rocky!
Look out!
Keep your hands off our vehicles.
(BOTH HOWLING) You tell her, Rocky!
Rubble!
Power paws!
Skye! On it.
Chase!
I'm... I'm stretchy!
CHASE: Uh, Liberty?
Can you please get us out of here? No problem.
Nice catch, Liberty!
Zuma!
You got to be faster than that.
You can't hide forever!
Huh?
These crystals belong to us, dude.
No!
It's time to shut down that Meteor Magnet once and for all.
No! No! Stop! What are you doing? Fire!
No!
Ooh!
You're in big trouble!
You'll have to catch me first!
Where do you think you're going?
You mangy mutts think you're so smart,
She's telling the truth.
There's hundreds of meteors heading straight for the city.
I guess I am a mad scientist.
Finally, she admits it.
Skye, I need you to fly up there
and destroy as many of those meteors as you can.
I've always believed in you, Skye.
You're the reason I started saying, "No pup's too small."
I'll give it everything I got, Ryder.
Wait.
If you're going up against those meteors,
We believe in you, Skye.
Let's take to the sky.
There you are.
Let's do this.
Fire!
Time to turn and burn.
I'm hit!
All right, space rocks, what do you got?
(ON BULLHORN) <i>There are meteors headed directly for Adventure City.</i>
<i>Evacuate the area immediately. I repeat, evacuate the area!</i> (PEOPLE SHOUTING)
Keep moving, everybody. Only bring what's absolutely necessary!
Come on, Skye.
Skye, there's a huge meteor incoming.
Wait a second.
Oh, no.
I can't do that, Ryder. I have to try.
RYDER: <i>Save yourself, Skye! That meteor's too big!</i>
No pup's too small.
No pup's too small!
No pup's too small!
ALL: Skye!
Skye!
Skye!
(MUFFLED) Skye!
Wait. What's that?
ALL: Whoa!
You see that right there?
Yeah, Skye!
Whoo-hoo! ALL: Yeah!
I'm so proud of you, Skye.
Way to go, PAW Patrol!
<i>and stop at nothing to keep the world safe.</i>
<i>Because even the smallest pup</i>
<i>can make the biggest difference.</i>
No pup's too small.

Perfect,

You can rinse off,
What's her name, the little blonde?
I guessed ?

Does she work for me?
Exactly,
So what ?
You suck!
Gaya,
I imagine the questions!
Anything !  Stop your delirium,
All these years, have you ever,,, Look at me!
It doesn't happen,
That's it !  Neither does getting drunk once a week,
That, too, should be avoided,
- Stopped, - Me, I like it,
We'll see at the bar if you're like that,
I have something to ask you,
What ?
If you can lend me some money,
In all, 3000, But even a part will be fine,
I'm sorry,
I wondered what it was,
of the two black keys,
The D is between the two black keys,
The notes are arranged from left to right,
What about Laura's boyfriend, then?
We will never see it,
No ?
She grilled,
What is this madness ?
Calm down,
Hold on,
Shut up !
Dad !
How are you, dad?
Yes,
Hi,
There is the sun,
Everything is fine ?
I'm a little nauseous,
Down,,,
There are already Laura and Ile,
She woke me up
You continued to sleep,
It'll be OK,
Some water ?
Some water,
Some water,
It's okay, water,
It's good,
So,
You'll be better off with that,
It's at my house,

Open wide,
a tingling lip,
Doctor,,,

What do you have ?
Have you ever had
memory lapses?
I mean,,,
leaving the bar,
You're worrying me here,
Of course yes,
That's what I'm asking you,
or is it true?
Have you seen her before?
And you ?
For the loan, don't worry, it's settled,
How so ?
I managed differently,
It's true ?
A heritage,
A heritage ?
put an apartment up for sale,
Great,
Stack at the right time,
Give me a coke,
How are you ?
Nickel,
Alright,
So,
How do you find it, Simone, lately?
Simone?
What kind of trouble?
That he tries
to make a quick buck,
Because,
when we leave here, we're drunk and we can barely stand,
He could have started dating someone
who may have offered him a plan
He never gave me the impression of being at this point,
So much the better,
If you notice anything weird,
warn me,
I do this for his good,
Simone is also my friend,
Sorry, you are right,
Someone who works at a dealership
For what ?
Stay calm,
I won't hurt you,
Stay calm,
What are you doing ?
It was me,
Excuse me,
What is happening ?
Who knows where we would have landed if I had continued,
Are you telling me what's going on?
wouldn't tell me you wanted to pay him to find out about me?
You're right,
I ask you one last time,
Tell me what's going on, please,

Didn't you go two weeks ago?
It's that,,,
I don't think he's doing very well,
you're the one who's not well when you see him,
It's Massimo, your son,
Did you do the scans?
Don't worry, I'm not wasting your money,
I see it,
We have to talk about something, you and me?
something that could
You spend your time caring for children's baby teeth,
You will never know real life,
Look at me, please,
Answer me,
Apart from having had you?
Raised you,
Are you aware that you only have me?
Have you thought about it?
I imagine you with your credit card
With,,,
And you, you will cry,,,
that I regret and leave you some money before leaving,
And don't talk to me about broken hips, pain,
Fuck it!
Frankly,
Garbage, that's what you are!
- What ? - You insult me, you attack me,
and you will call me to apologize crying,
Besides,
show me,
You have already started,
To cry,
Give me 200 euros,
My love,
I knew it,
I knew it,
It doesn't exist,
It doesn't exist,
Yes, because I knew it,
That way, I'll fall asleep thinking of them,
What is happening ?
What are you talking about ?
How so ?  It's cold,
When did you do this?
Want me to do it?
such as flooded and weakened roads and buildings
Let's move on to the various facts: family massacre near Latina,
The author is a father, an irreproachable watchman,
before pointing the service weapon at his 5 and 3 year old children,
both died instantly,
then tried to commit suicide without succeeding
by ingesting several tubes of medication,
But shit!
Why did you change?
Because,,,
What's the matter ?
So,
now it's over,
We're going to watch La Pimpa,
Tonight, we're not going out,
We stay here,
A half hour ?
Silly !
Pardon,
Hello dad,
What's the matter ?
What is happening ?
It's your birthday,
That's it, so,,,
It was a surprise,
THANKS,
THANKS,
We'll take your birthday
We are going through a bad patch,
obvious,
I would like us to protect everything we have,
That's why,,,
To help you during this time
difficult,
I'm crazy ?
How did you say?  A new start ?
Yes, you and me, we have to make a fresh start,
Dad !
What ?
You're the one who put it there, admit it,
Who ? What are you talking about ?
Massimo!
You want to get rid of me, right?
You have everything here: the house, the family, the money,
Calm down,
Look at me,
are you looking for the ideal husband?
How do you plan to do it?
Dad !
Mom !
We love you, dad,
It's her first composition, she wrote it for you,
Play harder, Ile,
Can you play harder?
You kill me playing like that,
Play harder,
Stronger,
Play harder, Ile,
You're creating a lot of problems for me,
It's not possible,
It's not possible,
GOOD,
What did you do ?
Did you have breakfast there together?
There were cakes?
There was everything,
I took them rollerblading in the mall,
Rollerblading?
After that ?
Afterwards,
we had lunch,
Still in the mall,
Then I searched
a new swimsuit for Ilenia,
I'm sorry,
You've said that often lately,
Have you ever hurt someone?
Have you ever fought with someone?
No,
You hit your daughters yesterday,
You hurt your daughters,
I know,
I only have you,
That's enough,
It's finish,
That's enough,
My family can't come with me?
We have finally freed a child locked in the cellar
no trace of other people was found,
Why are you so late!
<i>Happy birthday dear HWANG Phony</i>
Happy?
Nice!
Enjoy the cake.
Let’s go.
Saw her face?
SSONG!
Huh?
HAIL TO HELL
SCHOOL TRIP FORM
APOCALYPTIC PROPHECIES
<i>SONG Na-mi! Open up!</i>
Why you! Dying to kill yourself, huh?
Then die by my hands!
Ow! It hurts!
SONG Na-mi! Be strong and get over it!
No, I’m not! You never listen to me, Mom!
Think that’s being strong? That’s being damn insensitive!
SONG Na-mi! Come back!
Shit! I hope this damn world blows up!
Damn it!
Shit!
Holy mama!
What the?
ARE YOU ALIVE OR DEAD?
DUD
LOL
<i>Watch the fireworks light up the night skies!</i>
<i>Welcome everyone!</i>
- Damn slow. Hey! - Nice! $100!
It’s totally new!
Thanks Phony.
- Besides the cracked screen, it’s fine. - Thanks a lot.
I’m so happy.
- I’m so excited! - Look! Great camera, huh?
Hey, HWANG Phony! Thanks! I’ll make great memories with it.
Let’s get super drunk on Jeju soju.
You can’t even drink much. Don’t go overboard.
WAIKIKI LAND
Hey, HWANG Phony! What took you so long?
Sorry.
Come quick.
Cool, huh? No one can find us here.
Want some? Our last meal.
Not really.
I don’t like sweets.
Eat it all.
Let’s see.
Hey, Phony.
How can this work in a big place like this?
Set a fire with it?
No way!
I’m afraid of heights.
What’s this?
I was going to use that.
I’ll let you have it.
So classic!
What’s that smell?
You know what?
Okie, okie.
What the heck? Gross.
Right. I look damn ghastly, huh?
Come on, HWANG Phony. You’re a nice girl.
It’s a hateful person.
What?
The saying is “Give a cake to a hateful person.”
Here.
What’s this?
A will?
Yup.
Never.
Just put it in any mailbox.
Maybe it’ll reach someone like fate.
There’s gotta be someone in the world who’d understand me.
And my funeral...
You don’t have to come.
Fine. I’ll go right after you.
I’ll go first.
Yup.
You’re coming soon, right?
Okie, okie.
<i>You’re so damn weak!</i>
Hey, Phony! How dare you read that!
SONG Na-mi...
You haven’t heard about PARK Chae-lin?
PARK Chae-lin?
Yeah.
Seoul?
What are you saying?
Wait!
Sa... Save me.
Save you?
Really?
<i>What? Isn’t it cute?</i>
Didn’t her family run away overnight?
Look how well she’s living in Seoul.
She always dreamed about studying in Seoul.
She’s leaving? To where?
Chae-lin will probably soar in life.
So what? We’ll die soon.
Damn it!
It’s red.
Get up. Let’s go.
What?
Where?
Before we die, shouldn’t we leave a dent in Chae-lin’s life?
A dent? Like what?
Anything to bring her down!
First, we gotta find that evil bitch and see what she’s up to.
What the fuck!
I ended up like this because of her, but she started a fresh, new life?
Don’t you think it’s unfair?
She got the kids to bully you when you first transferred here.
They still take stuff from you, beat and treat you like shit!
Me too! Fuck!
Suddenly, they started to treat me like a loser and ignore me.
That bitch basically pushed me off a cliff one day!
I can’t just leave like this.
Before I die...
I swear I’ll leave a dent in Chae-lin’s life.
Then what?
Stick to our plan, right?
Of course.
Fine.
Let’s go.
Hey!
It’s damn far.
No way!
It’s not ours anymore. The bank owns it.
Wait here.
Hey.
Grab all the cash you can find.
Okie, okie.
HWANG Sun-woo!
Stop, you thief! Wanna die?
You’re giving my money to someone else again?
What?
You have a friend?
- Let’s go. - You’re an outcast!
Come back! I was alone all day.
Where are you going? I’m scared!
Daddy!
Sun-ju! Why are you out in the cold?
- She’s ignoring me since I can’t move. - Oh really?
If you needed money, why didn’t you ask me?
Daddy...
You’re fine, but she’s not...
I hate my life! That damn bitch!
Sun-ju! Daddy’s home!
Mom!
Let’s go.
Huh?
Okay.
We’ll go to Jongro and find Asia shopping plaza...
$2 bus fare each way...
Hey.
You said you don’t have parents.
Why’d you lie?
I never said that. You kids just thought that way.
They wouldn’t listen anyway.
And it’s sort of right.
Tell me everything. Why is your sister...
Forget it.
What good is knowing about me now?
You’re so cold, you know?
How’re you gonna make the dent?
Got a plan, right?
We have no money, gotta end everything in Seoul.
I’ll figure it out!
Just make sure you find the way there.
You said we need money!
JUNG-IL CHICKEN
Be careful. Let’s go back in.
Run your business properly!
That’s why you get bad ratings and comments.
What? You’re going to post bad comments too?
I’m not selling anything to you! Get lost, jerks!
Damn jerks.
Don’t mess with SONG Sung-hee! How dare you!
<i>Though it’s tough and lonely, it’s just a practice</i>
SONG NA-MI YOUR MOM’S FOOD SUCKS!
Damn bastards...
SUANBO TO SEOUL
Hey, kid! Come on!
I’m sorry.
<i>Welcome all passengers.</i>
Here. Will this do?
<i>For your safety, please wear your seatbelts.</i>
<i>Enjoy your trip, thank you.</i>
They must be sobbing by now.
Must be nice.
Why?
It’ll be campfire time now.
I’m done with this place.
Bye!
Hey, Phony! Wake up!
Let’s go!
Holy mama!
I’m afraid of heights.
Come on!
Look!
Sure it’s this way?
Yes, it is! Hurry up.
Low blood sugar.
ASIA SHOPPING PLAZA
It’s around here in Jongro.
What will you do when we find her?
They won’t know what an evil bitch she is.
That’s it?
It’s too abstract.
Wait and see.
I know that’s her weakness.
You don’t know her, just trust and follow me.
Let’s go!
- Everybody off. - Yes, Chae-lin!
Let’s go!
No running, please.
What is it?
Bingo.
What?
It’s PARK Chae-lin.
That bitch.
Where’d she go?
May I help you?
We’re just looking for a friend.
Friend?
No. It’s nothing. Bye.
It’s PARK Chae-lin. I saw her!
Oh, Chae-lin.
You came to meet Chae-lin?
Come in.
It’s okay. Come inside.
CHAPEL ENTRANCE
This way.
Wait a second.
What is this place?
Chae-lin? Where are you?
Sir! Did you call me?
Welcomed guests?
Come here.
SSONG!
You came!
You came to see me too, right?
Huh?
Thanks.
Chae-lin, they’re the ones, right?
Yes, they are!
Father sent them to me.
Thank you, Father.
- Father God showed us a miracle. - Thank you for coming.
It’s a miracle! Congratulations.
Thanks.
It’s so cool.
Amazing, huh? It’s a blessing.
Sorry about the mess.
Sun-woo... Na-mi...
Why do you keep smiling?
I am? I guess I’m happy to meet you.
Sure. You must have lots to talk about.
Have fun catching up.
Really.
What are you doing in a place like this?
Aren’t you going to study abroad?
Yes, I am.
It’s like an alternative school here. It’s different, huh?
You advertised it like crazy.
Give me the phone.
Shit, it’s turned off.
I posted them a long time ago.
I quit social media for good.
I’ll tell them everything you did!
They know already.
I want to apologize.
Back there and then...
I couldn’t bear the stress.
My mom was sick.
- And Dad... - You kidding me?
Because I had it so hard,
I think I wanted others to be more miserable.
Cut the bullshit! I don’t give a damn.
I had great darkness in here.
Like the devil.
Back then, I just did what it told me to...
Stop lying.
Sun-woo.
Please hear me out.
I’m born again now.
You came to punish me, right?
I can go to paradise now.
Do what I did to you two.
Hit me.
Do everything I did. Hit me.
You bitch!
Damn it!
What’s going on?
This isn’t right.
They’re in pain because of me. I’ll take the punishment.
<i>Amazing Father, how sweet the sound</i>
She’s so damn holy.
<i>I once was lost, but now am saved</i>
What’s wrong?
Where is she going?
<i>Was blind but now I see the light</i>
Dang. When will she...
She’s putting on an act.
I know she’s up to something.
Let’s just go.
What?
There’s no way to get her.
Of course there is! Just trust me.
How can I?
I’ll get abused again.
See this?
I’m gonna slit her throat.
Then she’ll die.
Then she’ll be comfortable.
Damn it.
Just slash her.
Make a mark on her face.
So she’ll suffer for life.
Hey, Phony!
You’re a genius!
Can you do it?
Damn bitch.
How dare she seek salvation!
Stop it!
Just keep practicing. It’s not that hard.
It’s okay. It must’ve hurt a lot.
Let it out. There, there.
It’s okay.
I’m not sure.
<i>Please answer our prayers. Amen.</i>
Don’t you have medicine?
We have a cure-all for everything.
What?
Amen.
If you pray with all your heart, he answers.
Faith is the ultimate cure.
Please hear our prayers and answer, Father God.
Sun-woo will be better in the morning.
You’re sleeping over, right?
What?
If she moves, she could get worse.
HYOCHUN MISSIONARIES
Come in.
I’m sorry.
NO CELL PHONES
If the kids see this, they’ll want to use it too.
Fine. Just give it back when I leave tomorrow.
Thanks.
Wait.
You’re not lying, are you?
Why can’t you trust me?
How can I trust a stranger?
Well...
What the...
I trust you, Na-mi.
The fact that you came here makes you very special.
You heard everything about how I was bullied.
I probably wouldn’t have lasted a day.
It must’ve been so hard on you all this time.
I hope I can be of help in anyway.
Chae-lin regrets it a lot.
What the hell!
So what if she regrets it? Damn it!
- Mind your own business. - But...
Na-mi.
Hey! SONG Na-mi.
Wake up!
Phony, you look totally fine.
What?
Why didn’t you slash her in her sleep?
It’s because...
Come out. We move together on schedule.
Okay.
It’s Offing.
What?
Why leave out the black beans?
I don’t like black beans.
So you should have it more.
Yes, ma’am. Thank you.
Yes, ma’am.
Oh, my! Thank you!
You came all this way! Good for you!
You look strong, why did you get sick, young lady?
Not me, she’s the one...
Eat up so you’ll get better.
God bless. I’ll pray for you too.
May it nourish not only our bodies but also our souls.
Fill us and lead us to paradise in the Apocalypse
Amen.
Right!
Why does he keep saying we’re friends?
Come on. Stand up.
She’s not my friend. My name is SONG Na-mi.
Welcome!
Shalom!
Good boy.
What’s this?
Vashianu.
Know it?
It’s paradise.
Paradise?
It’s in the South Pacific. That’s where I’m going.
Mom is already there.
It’s a great place.
You believe that?
Of course.
I’ll live by faith.
Things are really hard here.
I’m going to start over there.
Chae-lin.
Of course I’ll go.
Where?
There’s an important event tomorrow, so we’re going to prepare.
What’s the word? Field trip?
Wanna come along to get some fresh air?
Let’s go! Come with us!
Sure.
Let’s go.
You again?
No running.
Go that way. I’ll go there and corner her.
Keep going.
I can’t hear you.
Damn it.
Go. I’ll go around the other way.
What’s she up to now?
Holy mama!
Why are you so startled?
What? I am not!
This isn’t a field trip. It’s just hard labor.
It’s because it’s harvest day.
What?
What? No, I’m not.
SSONG. You haven’t changed a bit.
- She only gets hers. - Chae-lin helps us but she doesn’t.
She’s so selfish.
Come on. I’ll show you something.
Remember when we skipped school, but only you got caught?
The teacher made you run laps around the track and you fainted.
It was so funny.
So I bought some chocolate and candies for you.
That memory makes you laugh? It gives me the creeps.
Right.
You’re right.
I guess so...
Hold on.
You consoled me.
That you’d tell everyone about my family going bankrupt.
I did it to scare you, because I was scared...
Scared?
Found it!
We’re not allowed to eat this here...
Hey!
I...
I...
I understand.
I’m sorry, Na-mi.
Hey.
Can you help me? It’s a mess here.
Yes. What happened?
Chae-lin, you have stuff to do.
Can you help me?
JOO HAE-JIN
- Tomatoes! - Tomatoes!
Not again! Who did this?
I’ll take them all! They’re mine!
Stop it!
Don’t step on them! They’re mine!
Back off! They’re not yours!
YOU ARE INVITED THERE - PASTOR YOON
CHARCOAL
I was organizing these... They all fell and got scattered...
Was your town okay when the last typhoon came?
Yes, but nothing happened.
Everything got wiped away here.
We thought it was over.
But we planted again and they grew and bore fruit.
Isn’t it a great blessing?
Saying that’s because of praying?
Of course, it’s from praying!
Whatever.
They all had their struggles.
Me too.
With nothing but my own two feet, I failed at everything I did.
Living was...
like hell.
That’s why I came here.
But I don’t need it.
It looks dangerous.
Na-mi.
Don’t do it. You’re not that kind of girl.
I’ll help you. Trust me.
Do you like Offing?
You know Offing?
I only heard their first one.
I see.
I’ll lose points.
What?
Picking all this is no use. Repentance gets the highest points.
What are you talking about?
Everyone is saying that
you two will forgive Chae-lin and she will place first.
I’m really trying hard.
That’s why it’s so unfair.
Hae-jin. Calm down.
It can’t be the new girls here.
So you mean one of our brothers and sisters did it?
I’m not sure.
You go to hell!
Right.
But still...
I want an apology.
If someone committed a sin, Father God will punish them.
Demon, how dare you come into the human heart!
That’s not it...
Are you really Hae-jin?
I’m not a demon. Please trust me, sir!
Yes, it’s me.
Fine.
You’ll lose points this time, but next time you’ll be punished.
No, sir! Please!
What’s the punishment?
Pray for repentance for a week and write a confession.
There’s nothing much there.
Hae-jin!
Are you really Hae-jin?
Please, believe me! I’m not a demon, I’m sorry.
- Wait for me! Please! - Who’s first? Is Chan-ho last?
- Be careful! Don’t fall! - Damn, they got us.
They tricked us to work.
There’s someone like me here.
Really?
Who?
Her.
Girls!
Let’s go!
Not really...
But I think so.
Shouldn’t you be sure?
She was with me back then.
SONG Na-mi!
You believe her?
Of course not.
But honestly, she has changed a bit.
Come on!
Everyone, get off.
I wonder what gifts Mom brought for me!
Wait up!
Mommy’s here!
Good afternoon.
JOO Hae-jin! Doing well?
It’s okay. They’ll come tomorrow.
I’m not sure yet.
And you’re smiling?
We can prepare a surprise party for them.
A party?
We’ll blow balloons and put ribbons up.
- I’ll blow the balloons! - Really?
Yes!
They’re leaving. Go.
Kid!
Yes, thank you.
Good. I’m glad.
Go on.
Who are they? New recruits?
Not yet. They’re Chae-lin’s friends.
I see.
- Hello, brother Yeon-bok. - Sir Myung-ho!
Right.
It must’ve been a long trip.
What can we do? The offerings must be made.
Pastor YOON knows
how hard our brethren are working.
I was wondering...
What’s that article about?
What?
Did something happen in paradise?
Of course not!
You know Pastor YOON.
Those bastards are trying to harass us.
Of course.
Yes, of course.
Can I trust you?
Of course. Have faith.
Have faith!
Let’s go.
Okay.
I have to meet my mom.
Help me.
Still, I have to meet her.
I’m not asking you to lie.
Just look at who I am now.
In paradise,
Please...
Forgive me.
I’ll think about it.
If I didn’t, she’d keep sobbing.
What about our plan?
Gonna give up?
Why would I?
I didn’t give up.
I hate to see someone get bullied by her.
I just...
Same here.
Let’s just find another way to get her.
Just admit it.
That you’re too scared to do anything.
Hey, Phony!
Why do you keep doubting me?
Believe me.
But when I was about to strike, she apologized to me.
She said she was sorry.
Sincere?
Forget it.
You’re still her little underling.
Hey, Phony!
Get up!
Come on!
SONG Na-mi.
What?
Will you turn the lights off?
Sis! Come here!
Come on!
Why?
Tada! Look!
Wow! A cake!
It’s big, huh?
Wow!
- First time, huh? - Yes.
Let’s have it together tomorrow.
Strawberry cake is the best!
No, cheesecake is the best!
Wanna bet?
Na-mi? Come here please.
Me? Why?
Does strawberry cake taste better or cheesecake?
Yes!
I’m not sure.
Yes!
<i>Happy birthday dear HWANG Phony</i>
Enjoy the cake.
Wow! Eat it!
She looks prettier with it on.
Saw the look?
I know, right?
Let’s go.
SSONG!
Huh?
Come on.
Hurry up.
Coming!
RESTRICTED AREA
HWANG Phony!
Where’d she go?
Hey, Phony.
HWANG Phony.
Wait.
Get down from there.
Damn it.
Please don’t do this!
Aren’t you afraid of heights?
So come down from there!
Scared to death?
Let’s go back down and talk.
Phony... I mean, HWANG Sun-woo...
Let go.
I just wanted some fresh air.
Really?
You sure?
I’m sorry.
I totally suck.
I was like this before and I haven’t changed one bit.
Because I’m so damn weak,
I don’t need your apology.
I’m really sorry. Please!
Cancer causing chicken.
A waste of money garbage chicken.
The bad comments on your pub...
It was me.
Because just like the others, you laughed when I was crying.
I wanted the whole world to blow up.
So don’t apologize to me.
Stupid...
We can’t even die or live.
Shit.
Chae-lin, that tough girl, did it to send her mom to paradise.
Stop disappointing me!
It’s your last chance.
I’m struggling enough because of you!
Dad! No!
See? I’m fine! Just close your eyes and hit me!
<i>Daddy!</i>
<i>Mommy!</i>
SCORE BOARD
YOUTHS BOUND FOR PARADISE SERVICE POINTS
<i>deliver us from the fires of hell.</i>
- Amen! Father God! - I believe!
<i>We are weak and unprepared.</i>
<i>Happy birthday holy YOON Joong-wan</i>
<i>Happy birthday holy YOON Joong-wan</i>
Hallelujah! What a blessed day!
I will now announce the youth who will go to paradise.
What is it, Chae-lin?
I’d like to say something to our brothers and sisters.
Remember when I gave my testimony about all the sins I’ve committed?
The friends came to me like a miracle.
Our gracious God has answered my prayers.
Na-mi.
Will you testify?
I think she’s changed a bit.
Her apology seems sincere.
But so what?
I haven’t changed a bit.
I haven’t changed at all.
To be honest,
I’m not sure if I could be forgiven.
I know they’re just words to you.
But...
You know what?
I wanted to die less going around with you.
It’s weird, but I had fun with you.
I’ll follow whatever choice you make.
I’m not lying.
And PARK Chae-lin.
Thanks.
But why only apologize to me?
If you want a miracle, you should seek her forgiveness.
Stupid.
Ah... So, Na-mi...
Okay.
Is she repenting?
Hold on.
Now, I’ll announce the service points of our youths.
LEE Hyun-min, 56 points.
LEE Hyun-joo, 79 points.
RYU Chan-ho, 82 points.
JOO Hae-jin,
Hold on a second!
Yes?
Hae-jin! Come out!
What is he doing?
Hurry! Come!
- Brother Yeon-bok? - Just hit me once.
- Get up. What are you doing? - Hold on, please.
You can overturn the scores and go to paradise!
You need to repent to be saved!
- Wait, please. - Brother Yeon-bok.
Come on!
Get up. What’s with you?
Brother...
If you repent, you can win!
What?
- Sir Myung-ho, wait! - What are you doing?
Who’s she? Are you all in this together?
It’s okay.
Brother Yeon-bok!
Please stop.
What can we do if Hae-jin has less faith?
Jeez!
Now.
- Brother Yeon-bok? - Get lost!
Maybe next time.
Now, I’ll announce the youth who will go to paradise.
The youth going to paradise is...
Congratulations!
You have to come too!
Have some cake.
Chae-lin’s friend!
You were so brave.
We’re not friends.
You’ll stay here, right?
How about becoming my daughter?
Why would I? I have a mom.
For what?
She’s with our Father God there.
Sit down and eat.
I’ll bring you some cake.
HYOCHUN CHURCH DAY OF BLESSING
They look damn happy.
I can’t even breathe.
Thank you.
Wait.
I’ll let her hear their new album.
How can she get the points? They’re strangers!
Brother, please calm down.
Are you set on not sending Hae-jin?
Why can’t you believe me?
Father God... Please...
Sir Myung-ho. You know how we are!
I put everything I owned into this!
Why do I have to support others with that money!
Hey, Myung-ho.
Yes.
HAN Myung-ho!
Yes!
Why do you keep taking that bitch’s side?
What’s going on?
It’s nothing like that. You’re speaking out of bounds.
Whatever!
Just give me the money.
I’ll go to paradise and meet Pastor YOON to...
That’s enough! He has to be released to...
Father God!
This can’t be!
So that article... It was true?
I can’t tell you.
I... We have nowhere else left to go now!
I bet everything I have on paradise!
I’ll go this time and rebuild it.
Heard the Holy Spirit?
Yes!
I pitied you and took you in!
Brother. Please trust me.
I’ll go and rebuild it. Believe me.
Hallelujah!
What can a loser like you do?
Jeez.
How dare you mouth off like that? You’ll be thrown in hell!
The Holy Spirit came to you?
Fuckin’ Hallelujah!
- Believe... - Think you’re the Messiah?
What the hell?
You’re in this together, aren’t you!
I said believe!
I’ll rebuild it!
Sir...
Don’t cry.
It’s all over now.
It’s not over.
Get up.
Get your bank account and passport.
Now.
We can’t go to paradise. There’s nowhere to go now.
It’s all useless now.
Snap to it! Get up.
Wait up!
HAN Myung-ho... Where is that bastard?
Get her!
He’s bleeding!
That bitch... She did this with Myung-ho...
Brother Yeon-bok!
Go inside!
Catch that bitch.
I didn’t do anything!
Damn fools!
Ma’am, we didn’t do anything!
Shut up.
I can’t have you go and talk nonsense.
You’ll report us.
We didn’t see anything. Just let us go, please!
Ungrateful troublemakers. We were so nice to you.
You expect me to trust you?
Madam Mi-sook!
My dad is unconscious.
Go and pray harder.
Almighty Father God.
However, the devil is still at work. Father, save us from the devils.
It’s a potent demon all right.
Hurry up!
Let’s go.
Stay still!
Damn demons.
Let’s go!
Shut up!
Be quiet!
<i>Madam Mi-sook!</i>
Stay right here.
<i>Did you find HAN Myung-ho?</i>
<i>Not yet.</i>
<i>PARK Chae-lin, that bitch already confessed that</i>
<i>Right. He has nowhere to go. No one will welcome him.</i>
<i>What’s happening? There’s a strange new article...</i>
<i>Let’s go.</i>
Be quiet.
Get up. Let’s get out of here.
I’m staying.
Sir Myung-ho will come.
Snap to it, PARK Chae-lin!
It’s okay.
I’ll wait.
Father God...
Damn it.
Let’s just go.
We almost died for real, damn it!
The adults here are all crazy!
Who cares? Her life is on the line!
Be quiet!
Sir Myung-ho!
Sir Myung-ho!
Come out now!
HAN Myung-ho...
Sir Myung-ho! Let’s go home!
It’s over, Myung-ho! Let’s go home now!
Sir Myung-ho!
HAN MYUNG-HO
Sir...
Get up now.
Snap to it, stupid! That jerk won’t come.
He’ll come.
He will.
Stop being so stupid. He’s totally gone!
Leave me alone!
Hey! PARK Chae-lin!
Just go, will you?
He won’t come, ever!
He’ll come.
We promised to meet here.
We were going to receive salvation in paradise.
What damn salvation!
Pray all you want, but he won’t come!
Stop crying and let’s go!
He really left me?
He’s dead.
No matter how long you wait,
no one will help you.
Get up.
Let go!
Damn it!
Be quiet.
Wait.
Huh? Why?
Hey!
Where is she going?
Hey!
Hurry! Get on!
It’s too dark.
Look!
What’s that?
Fire!
There’s a fire!
It can’t end like this!
Father...
Oh, no!
Damn it...
Please don’t forsake us.
Father?
Dang!
What an awesome campfire!
Look!
Hear my prayer! Please, I beg you!
I’m sorry.
Look.
I told you it’s a ‘hateful person.’
It’s his will.
See to the rest.
And...
Just live on.
Right.
Don’t die.
What do we do now?
Not sure.
You’re good at planning.
I’m hungry.
Okie, okie.
I’m low on sugar.
Then what?
And then...
Let’s wash up. We’re a mess.
Okie, okie.
WHERE WE ARE IS PARADISE
What will you say?
The school trip.
Hey, HWANG Phony!
What? SONG Na-mi!
- You outcasts are together now? - So hilarious.
Must be!
HWANG Phony.
Come back here! You’re dead!
Let’s go!
She can’t run anyway.
See you at school! You’re dead!
Here.
Why do you still have this?
Take care.
Bye.
HWANG Sun-woo.
HWANG Sun-woo!
Why?
What’s wrong?
Welcome back to hell! Shit.
Okie, okie.
See ya.
I just love these old records.
Come on, sugar.
Who'd you get yourself off to in prison?
What?
Uh-huh.
Close your eyes.
Close.
Mm-hmm.
What got you sent away?
You a killer?
No.
Oh, I bet you are.
Show me how you did it.
Forget what a woman feels like?
I'm not...
I'm not like that.
I'm, um, thank you.
Sorry.
Lovey-dovey, my ass.
Ow, dammit.
The beach grass'll cut you to pieces,
but it holds the sea back.
Otherwise the lighthouse would be the only
dry land around here.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Permission to come aboard.
This is really your boat?
No.
I commandeered it.
Better.
Yeah...
I love the way you lie.
Bro.
You should make a film about my life.
See, in the Netherlands it's 'once a criminal, always a criminal'.
But in my country, we say:
Man or woman, doesn't matter.
Between madness...
Between danger... Between madness and genius...
danger and mercy.
That's how Abdi navigates his life.
No, no, no, this one:
Between mad... madness and danger...
mercy and packed with creativity.
Proop, proop. I shoot shapes: squares, diamonds.
Come have a look, Abdi.
- Does this color work for Mogadishu? - Definitely. That's some pretty sand.
Oh well, some Dutch people complain about everything.
I call this one 'Equilibration'.
Equilibration.
A small plant.
You prefer something more subtle?
Inside the box.
Outside the box.
Inside the box. Outside the box.
Master of creativity... Outside the box.
That's my fortune.
And I feel people's pain. I'm connected to many people.
All colours and religions, you know.
Because I was in the same situation.
It's like I'm helping me, but through someone else, you know?
Hello?
- Yes, my dear brother. - How's Mogadishu?
- Brother? - How are things in Mogadishu?
For real?
Explosions? How many people died?
May He have mercy.
Okay.
- Just the sky? - Yeah, just the sky.
Look. Can you see?
We built Mogadishu. Cool, huh?
That's my street. Yup, that's my street.
- Yes. - That dirt road.
- Let me know if they're any good. - Okay.
Yes, like that. One, two, three, action.
Just go like...
You understand? Word.
- Can you shave me? - Sure.
Whatever, I'm punched all day long.
Either that, or you're the one who punches.
Can you tell Sharif why you did that?
Get what I mean? You literally look and think: how did it happen?
You see?
No, you jump out, and where you emerge...
right here, you stay.
Then you face that way and shoot in the air once.
- Once, okay. - Yes.
I never knew you visited Somalia, Douwe.
So, I was walking right here.
You know, just minding my business.
It came down the road. And then, lemme see...
Some guys in a pickup just cornered that truck, like, bam.
I was right here, so we took cover behind this.
They started shooting.
Go away, assholes.
Go, go.
Make them go away.
Get out, get out.
Get out now.
With their AKs, shooting...
at other adults. They were shooting each other.
And we'd be right here, having our rock fights.
- Daddy? - Yes?
I will. Almost done here.
So...
One time, I think it was this one here.
Why is that funny? What's so funny?
- You don't? - No.
- Let's see it. - Douwe, show it on screen.
I was never traumatised.
About nothing, you see?
I never considered myself a victim.
How could I? I'm not.
I'm exploring, right? Discovering the world, you know.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Could you help me?
Good thing you're not a real soldier, right?
We fled from Kaaraan to El Dher and Masagaway.
- What year are we talking, 1995? - Yeah. No, 1994.
she got us a one-way ticket to here.
Look, that's me in the same year. 1997, right?
- Yeah. - We're both 13 here.
Already with the camera.
I'd been through nothing.
- This won't come off anymore. - No.
- Where'd you get that? - Went to the junkyard.
What, today?
- What's it about? - My workshop neighbour.
It's a guy from Somalia.
He made some bad decisions. Spent eight years in prison.
- Three years as a restricted patient. - Whoa.
Okay.
to save a single n-----.
- That went better, I think. - Yes, it did.
- But this is what he said? - Uh-huh.
It's a lesson you learn over and over: Trust no one.
So at some point you start to think: fuck you all.
You all jump into the gutter.
Look what you did to us.
- You blew it, you filthy dog. - I blew what?
Know what I mean?
Hand me that coat.
Your hand is almost at the knife. You look down...
An explosion of violence. Gimme that money.
Money. Gimme that money. See?
- Was that convincing, Douwe? - Yeah. Sure.
That was weird, huh? Be passionate no matter what, right?
Why won't you play this part?
Because I don't wanna relive that pain, you know.
It's fucked up that it happened at all...
This is tough.
I received these photos from the prison.
So look. This...
But I also have...
this, see?
- The kettle's still there. - Yes.
He's like, pay up. So I'm like, fuck you.
He's underestimating me, you see?
We're on fire on the inside, see?
We're no wimps, you know.
And in that moment, I'm alive. I live in that fight, you know.
It's just another thing I'm passionate about, you see?
You should. I'm passionate about my shelves, too, right?
I feel the same passion for fighting. I'm passionate.
- But that passion for fighting is gone. - Yeah, I create now.
I've had my share of fights.
Violence was all I had. It was my tool.
Total chaos, and then the past...
I used to explode.
You're fighting, but...
you're losing.
...police say the victim was stabbed...
- Three months? - Nah, it was longer.
It could have easily gone wrong.
My life after that moment would not have applied.
That's why I cherish the opportunity I've had.
I want others to have the same opportunity. Show them, look...
you have a chance to turn your life around.
Because you're on the edge.
- (...) is dead too. - (...) is dead.
They're gone. They're not the happy guys they used to be.
Just let him in.
See, that helicopter was right here.
I'm very happy with this.
I'm up here. So, right now...
Am I right?
Just throw me a rope here, and I'll go even higher.
But still it's not easy, you know.
Then again, life doesn't have to be easy.
That's what gives it its sauce, and scent and flavour.
It adds excitement.
And then at some point...
you become the chef, making the food instead of being eaten.
Your roles change, too. You become...
a master of suffering life itself.
You understand?
Were you filming me the whole time?
What's that?
Hello?
in two years since she started fighting.
She is such a fearsome rookie.
Yes, she's still a newcomer, but from what I've seen,
True.
They both are aggressive.
Tachibana's on the attack.
-Back off! -She's pretty good.
And another body blow!
This could be a pushover. There's another body blow.
Tachibana won all four matches by KO.
Well done.
-Great job. You did it. -She remains undefeated.
It would be a shame to let her just box.
I want her to be a better boxer first.
Today's main event is about to start.
Please return to your seat...
FIGHTING SPIRIT
Hey, Yuzuki!
Stop ignoring me.
I'll be the champ next.
I'll be the champion.
Right. Go harder.
Okay!
Go, go! Harder!
Thirty more seconds. Keep it up.
INVOICE
-Huh? -Here.
HIDETOSHI TABATA, MANAGER
The car was abandoned in a parking lot.
According to forensics, the car was filled with deodorizing spray.
All families say the same thing.
However, Ms. Tachibana...
We ran a DNA test too, and it was a match.
Wait a second!
This person doesn't. Look.
Handle this.
I'm terribly sorry.
Ran!
Yes, sir.
I thought they'd call us again.
-I was going to call after that. -You should have called me first.
If she'd died in a car accident, we'd have gotten the insurance money.
Left her behind? You have no right to say that.
I'm the one who fed her after you took off.
You just wanted the child welfare payments.
Shut up!
I overheard.
I was worried.
Not long ago,
It's all right. You focus on your fights.
It hurts?
Can I stay here tonight?
-If you don't mind the filth. -Really?
Deal with it.
FIRST AID KIT
You're really pretty, Ran.
What? Cut that out.
You should wear makeup.
-Don't you dare. -Just try it.
Yuzuki...
What if the body is really hers?
if you don't learn to pace yourself, you'll always be an amateur.
A real pro knows when to attack and when to retreat.
Forget everything for now and take a break.
Next, we have more on the incident involving the car that exploded and burned
BURNED BODY FOUND IN THE CAR
At 6:00 a.m. on the 21st,
a car in the parking lot suddenly exploded and caught fire.
-who attended high school in Kawasaki. -You haven't been eating much lately.
Forget about that stuff. Leave it there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
-Sorry. -I'm looking for my sister.
-Who's that woman? -She's nobody.
Come with us.
Hey!
I never said she died.
Yuzuki...
You're awake?
Antidote?
Have something to eat.
You're looking for Yuzuki, right?
Yuzuki must be very important to the Junin Group.
It's a very famous corporation.
SHIRAISHI, VP
The top executives are from old Japanese aristocratic families.
That club in Yokohama is
an exclusive club that only select people are allowed into.
So, how come you're telling me this?
The Garage?
They have rogues from Japan and abroad fight there.
He was once a Brazilian jiu-jitsu champion.
That's right.
-Shall we begin? -Yeah, why don't we?
how to smoke with style, haven't you?
Whenever I see that samurai painting, it reminds me.
They took up swords to defend the nobility.
Look at these.
Even if they weren't,
Even if I got it illegally, it'd be insane not to investigate such clear evidence.
Then bring the original files.
-Handa. -Yes?
Did anything fishy happen in forensics regarding this case?
-Handa. -Yes.
-Now, cross! -Yes!
-Right there! -Yes.
Darn her.
Kito!
Kito! Kito!
Certainly, sir.
There's too much blood.
Don't drop him.
Hey, you can leave now.
-Yes, sir. -We gotta go.
You're as invincible as ever.
You've still got energy.
Eight.
What'll happen then?
I appreciate it.
Nobody imagined it.
However, this repulsiveness is a problem.
Why have you come to this repulsive place?
No, it's fine.
Hey!
Huh?
Usually I'd pay 200,000 yen. But not for this one.
It's stolen, right?
Now, now. What's the hurry?
You bastard!
Hey, get out of my way.
There!
Hey, where you going? Clean this mess up!
Hey, listen up!
The body the police showed me didn't have it.
Good evening.
The shop's doing well?
Here.
I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN SOON
Don't even try it.
Here.
I see.
NARUSE
Azuma is inside.
I believe he's buying the drugs they give out to the VIPs at the club.
What a douche.
Wait. You can't just walk right in.
Let's tail Azuma after he finishes the drug deal.
I'm not waiting until then.
Yes.
You're kidding.
I'll go check it out. You stay here.
Over here.
Hey.
You're just a drug addict.
Beat it.
-Tell me... -It should be fun.
What's that girl like?
-Hey, tell me. -Shut up.
We could make a lot of money with them.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, don't just stand there.
-Go! -Get her!
Hey, this way.
He's above you!
I missed.
Huh?
Shut up, you bastard!
We've got to run.
Let's go, Ran.
We're almost there.
I'll be fine.
HAMA-KAWASAKI POLICE STATION
Mr. Suzuki.
Thanks.
I had my friend in forensics check it out secretly.
Either the sample was contaminated,
or the DNA sample was switched.
Actually,
It's called Rh-null. Only a few people in the world have it.
It's also known as "golden blood."
-"Golden blood"? -Yes.
Morning.
Are we really going to investigate this case again?
But if I don't do anything about this,
I'm more afraid for Yuzuki who's been kidnapped by those assholes.
Is this really something worth abandoning all that for?
then I'll get the chief of police to find someone else for me.
Huh?
Mr. Nikaido, I will handle everything.
I had all the records revised to make it look like a gang conflict.
What's with all this fat?
Pretty pathetic for a cop.
Naruse.
Ran.
Only on the condition that you hand over my phone and photos you took.
Fight Kito at the Garage.
Ran! Ran!
Wait! Yuzuki!
-Wait! -Ran!
Wait!
-Drive. -Hey! Wait!
-See you later. -Hey. Wait!
We've got plenty of evidence.
I'm telling you these things aren't easy.
there's no way I can let you go there.
at the Garage had records of all the spectators' names and bets.
If we can steal that data, we could use it to negotiate.
If she fights in an illegal match,
Without Yuzuki,
This is where Ran stayed.
Officer, she's got talent.
about the Yuzuki Tachibana's case.
You need a way to win.
In boxing, there are refs and rules.
Hang in there. Keep it up!
Give it all you've got!
One more.
Don't attack uselessly.
-That's still 26. -What?
If this happens, you'll get strangled to death.
they'll start thinking that they just might lose.
This will be plenty.
You must be Knuckle Girl. How cute!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Welcome. -It's Knuckle Girl.
-Coming through! -Excuse us!
Come on.
Ran.
Mr. Azuma. She's here.
It's ready.
Excuse me.
-Is everything ready? -Yes.
All means of communication have been blocked.
-Let's go. -Right.
Hey!
Who the hell are you?
What? Is it because Knuckle Girl is cute?
Mental.
Unbeaten during his eight years of fighting,
this invincible colossus is the undefeated champion.
Giant Kito!
He'll be facing the woman who's come to save her imprisoned sister,
the indomitable female boxer,
Knuckle Girl will be allowed to use knuckledusters.
and Giant Kito which we've all been waiting for.
Here we go!
Five, four, three, two, one.
Ran!
Tighten. That's it.
Yay!
Ran...
Kito! Kito!
Ran!
So naive.
I plan on having fun while I slowly kill you.
Kito! Kito!
Kito! Kito!
Knees! Use your knees!
Kito! Kito!
Ran!
Come on!
Just do it already!
Respond if you can hear me.
Is this it?
Useless piece of shit.
Move it!
How dare you?
Keep your promise!
Like I said,
Watching you fight...
-What's up? -Oishi.
I think we should leave now.
Kill the two in the Garage.
Yuzuki!
Hurry!
Get in the elevator!
Hurry up!
That's a cute name.
-leader of a low-level criminal gang. -Seriously?
In addition, a police sergeant
I'll give you that chance.
Hey, Azuma. Don't turn this into a bigger mess.
If this keeps up, I might have to do something you won't like.
-What should I do? -Call an ambulance.
I got rid of him.
Vice President.
but nothing has happened to the people who should be running.
It's me.
Okay. I'll be going.
that was in the president's account.
Why you...
Yes.
The cryptocurrency used at the Garage, Junin Coin,
-This should do the trick. -Thanks.
It's nothing! I'm fine!
-We gotta get outta here! -Okay.
-Shun! -Mr. Kamiya!
-Shun! -Wait! Wait!
Shun!
Shun, hang in there!
Ran.
I was...
Yuzuki is waiting.
Please!
Shun! Shun!
Stay with me!
We've come this far.
I've sold all the businesses for cash.
Could this be Ran Tachibana?
Very interesting.
If you do, I'll release your sister.
Release Yuzuki first or there's no deal.
Push the button.
Yuzuki.
Glad you came.
Let's fight, you and me.
If you defeat me,
That's repulsive.
Repulsive?
Yuzuki!
You stimulate me every time.
Stop, please!
Ran!
Ran! Ran!
No!
Ran!
Ran! No!
Ran!
Ran!
It's my everything.
I won't let anyone interfere.
Yuzuki...
End it.
No!
Ran!
Ran!
Police! Don't move!
-Go check the other rooms. -Yes.
Yuzuki.
6 MONTHS LATER
Hello.
-Yuzuki. -Thanks.
Tabata's rookie.
She won all four of her fights by KO.
All right!
Ran Tachibana!
The man was naked,
...he was running through the tall grasses.
A mulemba,
a very, very tall mulemba.
Charge!
Why? Why did you do it?
Baby's heart pulling me one side...
I'm baptising you so you won't ever forget...
mines are for blowing up.
If you put our mission at risk again...
I'll burn you alive.
Yara will forgive me.
I want the people to feel me.
I can't girl, my boss won't let me.
Come on, you're tiring me, just do it.
Cobelo, put everyone inside...
and get rid of this girl. We have to go. Move!
Ya sista, you can't imagine the shit it got me in.
Yesterday the cops busted me.
No way.
They beat me up and took all the money.
So sorry, bro. That wasn't my intention.
No sweat, sista.
They're scared of your music Yara.
<i>We live off irony</i> <i>And you all know what that is</i>
<i>Sex is a profession</i> <i>Little kids are criminals</i>
<i>We have to fight</i> <i>To overcome</i>
<i>I don't change my ideas</i> <i>To convince my parents.</i>
<i>The path lies ahead</i> <i>We shouldn't look back</i>
<i>Come rain or shine</i> <i>This shit has to end</i>
Bro bro bro, that was it, savage, man!
We have to make this demo now!
You're right Bola.
They could bust us.
But Ginga...
you just think think, you're never sure, are you?
Forget all that Ginga!
Yara, we're no good to anyone in prison.
Ginga I prefer that prison to being locked up...
But rap is guerrilla warfare. You sing and run.
Bro, Carnival is our best and only chance to spread our demo.
We go into all that confusion and spread the whole scene bro.
Because they're scared the people will rise up.
with the beat of our rap, Ginga.
But Yara, you're a rapper not Rambo.
You sing and run.
That way they never shut you up, get it?
Man, if you're into that, I'm out.
Bola, give us our beat.
<i>We live from begging</i> <i>Counting the cost</i>
<i>For a handful of coins</i> <i>Another kid is lost</i>
Yeah, we're gonna spread this, okay.
He's my husband.
They said he went missing in action.
Did anyone see him?
What's his war name?
And who told you he was here?
He did.
You should ask the Shooter.
He's had more war than all of us put together.
Spit it out, what's your problem?
Did you ever fight with a comrade...
I've fought with comrades with eyes of every colour.
They said he went missing in action.
Does this photo help?
If I remember anyone like that, I'll tell you.
If you wanted to find someone in this war...
and no one ever leaves.
You'd better untie it before it chokes you.
Han, yo... I don't conform to Living in a country
Where the ones who should protect us Become the agressors.
Han, and what about my rights?
My songs don't reach far They don't play them on the radio or television
NEW COUNTRY
Mulemba, Mulemba...
I find myself...
in the comfort of your shade,
and in the firmness of your roots,
Here time doesn't exist...
and we are happy,
the soul is still in shade,
the presence that sustains the earth...
That's pretty.
Who taught it you?
I learnt it from my mother.
She sang it a lot before my father died.
When the war's over, you'll be a singer.
No.
Writing what?
My stories, my dreams.
Those with beautiful dreams fight better.
Weapons also kill dreams.
...in the area of Soyo,
in the oil fields.
Our unit was surrounded,
after heavy fighting all through the night.
And there were some wounded.
The sun was coming up
There was a fighter called Venga.
He put down his weapon,
took off his uniform and smiled,
he looked like a crazy man,
He set off running into the jungle.
The enemy went after him and we managed to escape.
In my mind...
in my head...
I can still see that look...
This Venga, is it my Ekumbi?
Nayola...
If you want to find your husband
search with your heart.
But, how?!
That story, when did it happen?
Stay back!
Shooter!
Take the bazooka.
Go on!
Go on Nayola.
Point it at the front of the plane.
Shoot.
Shoot!
What a fury girl.
What time do you call this?
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
You have to pick the hours out...
And pick them before they suck the life out of you.
That's why I like this clock so much.
What happened to your T-shirt?
God help us!
God's had other things on his mind lately.
and I'll lock you in the house until you learn some sense.
That was a Kalashnikov!
- They're rockets, Mama. - It's Carnival.
But what are they celebrating?
They're celebrating life.
Life with gunshots?
the conditions of our people.
I was on his side.
Against my mother.
You don't clip the wings of a falcon.
You give it raw meat, to make it strong.
Raw meat didn't work for either of them,
else they'd be here with me now.
See you tomorrow, Mama.
See you tomorrow, granddaughter.
Mama...
The war ended 8 years and 12 days ago.
You know, sometimes I dream a lot...
I also dream a lot about your mother.
It's not my mother I dream about.
That jackal has been circling us since sundown.
My husband's war name is Venga.
Venga disappeared in Soyo.
People don't disappear like that...
They are alive or dead, but they are always somewhere.
Here people disappear very slowly.
Nephew?
Uncle?
What are you doing here?
I'm fighting for the people.
We are children of Angola.
You should be studying!
No, Uncle.
You're on the wrong side, Uncle.
What i know about the wrong side...
is that it's the side my father fought for...
and died for this country.
Your father was my brother...
...and died on the wrong side.
Wrong side for those who fought for independence...
This is also my fight!
Again the wrong side conversation?
You're coming home with me right now.
Just stay calm...
Let's talk...
Talk?!
Let's stop the music for a bit, we'll continue later.
But now a moment for our Lotte.
Who will honour us with a song.
Madame, if you please.
Give me that sac!
The war is over.
We killed so much and we died so much.
There aren't many left to tell how it was.
I suffered so much too.
the Portuguese killed my man.
I fled from the south to here.
Then...
in the Civil War...
I lost my son-in-law
and right after that...
my...
my daughter.
As you can see...
I only have war in my life.
Who is this joker, Mama?
I like your jackal mask!
This is us.
Ya, I get you.
I think everyone should wear a mask...
to show who we really are.
Me, for example...
I'd wear a Medusa mask.
Careful, with the glass.
- What happened to her mother? - She abandoned me.
No, she didn't.
She disappeared during the war.
She might still come back.
Please, just go.
You can't do that!
We'd like that.
He fell face down in the mud...
sunk, and disappeared.
It was raining...
I heard more shots...
then soldiers went by.
Then a tree began to grow...
A mulemba...
a very, very tall mulemba.
You know? It's good you're here listening.
It's almost like we were a family.
Hey girl...
...you can't stay there.
It's dangerous!
Do you work here, uncle?
I do...
my father worked here...
my grandfather worked here...
Where does this go?
The wind is changing.
Peace is coming for the others...
those who haven't been bitten by the war.
Peace.
Peace, peace, peace!
and no one ever leaves!
That doesn't go anywhere.
What a beautiful death...
a death full of life.
Be careful!
The war's over
Peace, peace, peace peace!
Yesterday I walked through the city,
People looked at me with pity.
I don't want anyone's sympathy.
Tell me...
would you leave your two year old daughter behind...
to go looking for your wife?
Can I see?
Don't, Yara...
he might kill us!
- Don't worry, Mama. - Trust me.
So you'd better escape through the window.
I'll show you.
Come on.
No way!
My mother's journal stays with me!
Wait Mama...
who is this man?
Are you...
Alright.
Take whatever you want, and go.
Stop, Yara.
Don't do anything stupid.
Oh, oh, no, no don't!
Let us go.
It's best for all of us.
Quiet! Or I'll break you into pieces!
Mama, open the door...
and shout to those cops to come quick.
Her?
Shut up!
I sang my songs, my truths.
Please Yara...
go to the hiding place.
You'll give the journal back, won't you?
take off your mask...
If anything happens...
I recognised you by your fingers.
Open up!
Good evening.
No.
Are you still angry with me?
And your mother?
Yara is strong.
Full of fight...
Just like her father.
That little girl has given me some grief.
that happened to be the only one I had.
That girl took a bottle of varnish...
She painted the lips, nose, two eyes, and also the eyebrows.
She said she wanted to make her mother beautiful.
She accidentally spilt the varnish on the photo
and everything was covered in red.
Why are you talking in Kimbundo?
Are you crazy?
Stay here with us.
Your daughter needs you.
Open up!
I advise you to open!
Police, open up!
Drop the weapon! Stop right there!
Don't move or i'll shoot!
Let's go.
Did you know that man, Mama?
And I've already warned you
She will stay here
and I will go
Evil people are after her
On a tide of misfortune
No death, no doom, no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair
How are you feeling?
All right?
All good?
This is the usual procedure just in case.
Give her 40. We need to increase the contractions.
Honey. We're going to try
and touch the baby's head. Just relax.
Bad position.
Everything will be fine.
Help us, okay?
When I tell you, breathe in
and push. Breathe in.
Okay, push, push, push!
Push hard, push hard!
Okay, got him.
Well done!
I can't get the shoulders out, Anna.
- McRoberts maneuver? - Please.
- Okay. Ready? - Let's do it.
Start pushing!
And some people want a home birth, huh?
Yeah, but on a gurney.
Don't take sick leave. I'd never forgive you.
Hello!
Hello, baby. Come here, furball.
What?
Come with me.
I should have married you, Tesla.
Gonna help me tidy up?
Come on, off the bed.
Come here.
They turned out awesome.
Looks like a new apartment, huh?
That's it.
I'll send it.
Done!
Come here.
Well, they seem nice.
What an awesome house!
And they speak Spanish.
So, you stay with Lucas.
Done!

Honey.
Sorry.
He wants a panic room in his house,
but he wants it so hidden it's impossible.
And there's a subway strike.
Jesus!
So,
a perfect day.
- Clients need taking care of. - Sure.
You could have called.
Ran out of battery.
From playing Pokémon.
I'm hungry.
No way.
Hey, did you make crème brûlée?
You're the best.
I said with alcohol.
In the Black Forest?
It's a home swap.
Nothing in life is free.
Like each one had a hostage.
"Don't break the washing machine, I won't pee in your undies."

Lovely...
When?
You already know when.
- Remember? - Sure, March 3rd.
February.
February 3rd, Marc.
February is impossible.
I have to finish the project for this pain.
We already discussed this.
Sorry, honey.
What's up?
I really mean it.
I'm fed up of doing absolutely everything by myself.
Tesla, this, everything.
You're not alone.
You didn't even read any of the books I gave you.
I won't be delivering my own baby.
I'm gonna need you there.
It's important to me.
I need it.
Morning.
Hi.
in three or four sessions.
Is that a yes?
It'll do us good to chill, right?
The kitchen is such a mess.
Honey.
Hey.
No sugar or chocolate for her.
Mix the feed with canned stuff.
How are you?
I'm great.
I'm about to finish my book.
You need to fix the door upstairs.
You didn't answer my messages.
Yeah?
I didn't find the ring. Sure you lost it at my place?
Yeah.
Strange.
Bye, sweetie.
chocolate biscuits.
Let us know if anything happens, Serafín.
You have our keys?
- Thanks for everything. - Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
How sweet.
You're talking with a couple

Lately I don't have much time,
but I like to look after myself.
Thanks... thanks.
Like it?
Yes, it's cool.
It monitors my movements.
measures my heart beat,
and it tells the time too.
No, please, no.
<i>Danke.</i>
I don't like having a watch that's smarter than me.
How's the pregnancy?
no alcohol, no smoking,
a healthy lifestyle.
<i>Danke schön.</i>
Honey.
This is a GT! It has 450 horsepower!
Hey, don't scratch it.

I'm Lili,

I'm Anna, and he's Marc.
You speak Spanish too?
I collect them.
Each language brings with it its own way of thinking.
German, for example,
has words that are both beautiful and terrible.
Know what it means?
The longing for new places.
The suffering that makes us travel.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
She's obviously adopted.
Think I'm sexy?
I didn't even notice.
Watch this.
One, two,
three, four and five.
Now here.
The walls don't match.
Like there's a secret room?
Amazing, huh?
But...
what would it measure?
I think it's a panic room.
There's no door, no window.
What about ventilation?
It's perfect.
Not that perfect, you found it.
Because I'm the Sherlock Holmes of architecture.
What was that you said?
- Got it? - Sure.
Marc?
Marc?
Honey?
Marc?

Hiya.
Honey?

Darling?
You're scaring me.
Marc!
Honey...
How are you?
You were so lucky.
You could have killed yourself.
It was a miracle.
Honey...
What are you doing?
Marc?
Won't you say anything?
Marc!
I'm going home tomorrow.
SETTLE IN TO THE NEW HOME
Thanks.
<i>It's a miracle that you're alive.</i>
You guys are the miracle.
Of course I will. Speak soon.
Morning.
Morning.
Come here.
What's that?
Iron supplement pills, like the ones you usually take and forgot to bring.
Here, freshly squeezed.
How's your leg?
Ready for the outing.
Aren't we here to do sightseeing?
The insurance will cover everything.
The important thing is that we're okay.
He calls you "partner" now?
He's odd.
But he's charming. I think he likes me.
Let's hope it doesn't conk out before we leave.
Here.
You'll drive better than me.
Okay, so where to?
He's navigating for us. Drive.

What happened?
Too many hormones, I guess.
Just tell me one thing.
The baby.
Is it mine?
Marc...
Really?
Of course it's yours.
Sure?
That was ages ago...
But I swear, I swear,
that since we decided to have a baby,
I cut off all ties.
I feel like I've been born again.
We have another chance...
...and I wouldn't like to lose you.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.
Super ugly, right?
What a horrible place.
Come here.
I'm sorry.
Marc.
The lights?
Ta-da!
<i>Welcome home, Hans and Olga.</i>
The chimney too.
Sure you're okay?
I'm fine.
How about Simón?
What if it's a girl?
It won't be.
How do you know?
That would be a pity.
Bruna,
we could call her Bruna.
It smells weird.
You're going out like that?
Yeah.
Sure you can drive?
These are working. Have one.
Need anything?
Strawberries.
Strawberries?
The first craving I've had.
All right. Strawberries, then.
"Your guests are a bit weird".
You're an asshole.
Why did you tell Marc everything?
DELETED
<i>Movement detected two nights ago.</i>
<i>Hi, Marc.</i>
<i>I found this ring when I was mopping the floor.</i>
<i>"Lucas and Marta, together forever."</i>
Excuse me...
You're next.
You need to run, now!
Don't wait a second longer.
I don't understand you.
You need to run, now!
Honey!
Look who I met in the village.
Sit down here.
Marc!
Marc...
Marc... Marc.
There's a strange woman in the bathroom.
Call the police.
<i>Majo!</i>
<i>Kontena!</i>
She escaped from a psychiatric hospital. Capgras syndrome.
Are you okay?
Tonight is <i>Fasnacht.</i>
The local carnival.
Witches come down from the forest and take over the village,
Don't know about you guys, but I need some distraction.
You're welcome to come.
All the local families
They're an heirloom
that goes back centuries.
Do we do anything?
Just go with the flow.
Those earrings suit you.
Honey.
We should talk about Hans' message.
No.
There's no need.
What happened?
No, leave them on.
They suit you.
You got dizzy.
The barman mustn't have understood me.
It's only one beer.
I can't feel it.
Don't worry.
You always said...
that stress can cause it not to move.
Maybe it's asleep.
Anyway...
There are ways to wake it up.
Tesla?
What's up?
Tesla?
You're really tense.
To have fun.
To rise from our ashes.
Come on.
Lie back.
That's it.
What's that?
It's a <i>freya.</i>
It means rebirth.
It's never too late to change.
I guess.
Better than "Mother's Love".
Yeah.
Hello, I'm the neighbor.
The dog snuck into the house.
May I come in?
Thank you.
Tesla?
Tesla?
Tesla? Hey!
What's up? Tesla?
Tesla?
Tesla, what...?
Meaning?
- Sure. - Sure, what?
We got them together.
When?
Last night when I was unconscious?
I'd never do anything like that.
No, no.
The hormones are confusing you.
Careful, don't cut yourself.
Knowing you, I should have refused.
But you were so keen...
Knowing me?
Who are you?
You've suddenly become someone
Who are you?
I know...
I made mistakes.
But now I'm not so sure.
I'm scared, Anna.
that our love was so real, we'd never die.
I want an ultrasound at my hospital.
Why not here?
Come on.
Take one.
It'll do you good.
Take it.
It's fine.
I'll call Hans and tell him.
Don't worry.
Hans?
What's up, partner?
Done. We're leaving tomorrow.
Thanks.
Come with me?
I'd rather stay and book the ticket.
Whatever you want.
I won't be long.
How's Tesla?
You said the neighbors were doing weird stuff.
Lucas?
<i>We can't find her anywhere.</i>
<i>To notify people, ma'am.</i>
<i>So sad.</i>
<i>You're next. You need to run, now!</i>
I got strawberries.
<i>Welcome home, Hans.</i>
What are you doing?
I wanted some fresh air.
Why the purse?
That way I can buy something in town.
You look tired.
Marc told me to stop by.
I've brought biscuits.
Freshly made.
I'll hold it for you.
Come on.
Get comfortable.
It's really great here.
And the tea?
Coming up.
Can I have my purse?
So cute.
No! No! No! No, please!
Please, don't!
Marc...
Marc wants to salvage the relationship.
He understood the sacrifice.
I'm not giving you my body.
Really?
Our guests left us a message that's... worrying.
<i>Worrying?</i>
Hello?
Yes?
Police?
I just found a dead body.
Of course I'm sure.
Did you call the police?
What about his wife?
Thank you. Thank you, Serafín.
She's still alive.
No one will believe her.
Come in.
The owners have been notified.
They'll be back when you finish investigating.
She must vanish completely.
LEAVE THE HOUSE JUST AS YOU FOUND IT
You shouldn't be here.
Mónica, right?
She adores you.
I'm standing in for someone.
There's an emergency in OR three.
They've run out of oxytocin, gauzes...
With all the cuts...
Let's see...
So?
What do you think of Klaus?
What if it's a girl?
Lilith,
like mom.
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
You still have cravings?
Olga!
Also called "The love hormone".
It's responsible for making us love one another,
It also helps to speed up labor.
Barely an inch...
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit...
It hurts, doesn't it?
Now you'll feel an intense pressure.
Especially without painkillers.
Then what, huh?
Anna?
Look at me!
All this pain...
you're hurting yourself, can't you see?
Don't you like what you see in the mirror?
You bitch!
Mirror, mirror,
Think about it.
When the baby is ten, you'll be 80.
Hello?
Please open up!
Right away, Marc...
Don't go, Serafín!
Anna... Anna, untie me.
All we need
is the baby's blood.
You old bitch!
Yes!
I love you.
Come in, please.
Geez.
What up, booboo?
- What are you doing? - Washing my hands.
Why can't she just thug it out?
Because I got work. I can't watch them.
I don't fucking know where you're gonna get $400.
- Ask her aunties. - Mom, her aunties don't even like me.
Your baby mama? Or me?
Yo.
Yeah, where you live at?
Alright.
Come on.
Come on.
She's pretty cool, huh?
Come on.
Hey, you good?
Man, dog, I'm fucking confused bro.
Fuck bro it's hot outside.
Hotter than Germ's math teacher.
Oh, score.
It's a bologna sandwich.
Hey. I'll give you 50 bucks for this couch.
Hey, Donny, look at these.
Alright, after I look I'll return it.
- Geez! - What?
- Fuck that. - Why?
Bruh.
Shit's bunk.
It's meth.
Meth is the best. I'm about it, walking around like that.
Like you tried it.
- Well, I did. - Oh. My. Gosh.
- But I did. - Geez.
And it tastes like shit.
it makes you skinny.
It makes you throw up all your food.
You stay up for 14 days.
Bro one single fucking hit.
One hit you're addicted.
Fucker.
Boy, you're like 10.
Chicken wing, no way.
Let's sell it.
I was talking to somebody about returning a dog.
Oh, yeah. She's mine. Let me see.
Come on.
- So, what's good? - Not much.
- You got a return fee? - For what?
Well, we were just thinking, since we brought it back
you could hook it up with a little something.
That's bad for business.
because you found her.
- She's expensive though. - Fuck.
Fuck, yeah. Shit.
Holy fuck, man.
We could've just ran off with it.
We're coming because we're bringing your dog back.
Shit. Could be tonight.
His donkey looks retarded.
100 bucks, bro.
Well, I'll tell you this. We'll take 40 and the hoots.
Alright, for sure, boys.
Pleasure doing business with you and your donkey.
Yeah, papered, but we have to pay tomorrow.
- What's he getting a poodle for? - Puppy soup.
- Well, hit me back. - Bro, what you getting a poodle for?
Bro, because when I breed her, that's like 10 Gs per litter.
Shit. How much?
I just said that. She's a rack, but I got a good deal.
- Damn, a rack for a poodle? - Yeah.
I've been saying, man.
- Hello? - Who's he gonna breed it with, bro?
He's gonna need two of them.
Yeah, if you want to split the litter you gotta come in on half.
- Who you talking to? - I'm talking to Tiberius, man. Chill out.
Man, fuck that motherfucker.
No, it's a legit poodle, bro.
Yeah, bro. If we get the brindled ones, it's 4K a dog.
Bro, tell him I said fuck him, bro.
This is business.
I'm trying to have him buy the dog with me.
I could care less, bro. Still, fuck him.
- Tell him I said that shit too. - Shit.
Hello? Who are you talking about?
No, man. We ain't fucking talking about you.
We are fucking talking about you.
Man, shut up.
- Did he call Popcorn? - Shit.
Yeah bro. But remember Popcorn is breeding with Sissy Sanchez now.
Pop this bitch…
Hey, bro. This ain't enough.
- I got you. - Alright, thank you, Auntie.
I got him.
Shit…
No?
Echo!
- Echo! - What?
You. Where you been at?
Home.
I got you this.
- I gotta go. - Why?
- Why? - Because I'm mad at you.
- Shit. - Yep.
I'm a changed man.
I gotta go.
Fuck.
You haven't showered in four weeks.
Chee four.
- Alright, alright. - Nay this guy laughed.
Fuck it, out.
Stealing from your own dad now?
Hello?
No.
I did.
- I need the bed tonight. - Okay.
Oh, and a GPS system.
What's the best you can do today?
- It's $250, man. - Fuck.
I'll take that rice cooker for $20, though.
$20? Alright then.
It's like a two-for-one deal.
Well, how about $22 for both?
Yeah. That sounds good.
Bro, you know anybody looking for any PS4s?
No, we don't buy PS4s, bro.
You might have to try Prairie's Edge.
Fuck, alright.
100 equals 10 to the second power.
10 times 10.
1,000 equals 10 to the third power.
10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10
Now, we can do it with another number like two
which is pretty straightforward.
Two to the first power equals itself.
Two.
Two to the second power equals four.
Now…
Two to the fifth power?
Good. Two to the fifth power.
20?
Two times eight is 16.
Two times 16 is 32.
Any questions on this so far?
So, see you tomorrow.
<i>Carly.</i>
.<i>… an inmate at the County Correctional Facility.</i>
<i>- and to accept this call --</i> - Accept.
<i>What are you doing? Come bail me.</i>
<i>For a traffic violation, Bill. I don't know.</i>

Nah, I'm gonna breed her,
but I gotta pay this girl tomorrow.
<i>How much?</i>
<i>Alright. No problem.</i>
- What's up, man? - Howdy.
You need some help?
I could help you like,
take you to Rush or something.
Well, where do you live?
About two miles out of Scottsbluff.
Yeah? How much?
Shit.
Scottsbluff is pretty far. Plus, I need some gas.

Nothing.

Tight. Tight.
Well, you wanna play some video games?
Nah, I gotta work.
Why, you still got that one job?
No, those fuckers fired me over some dumb shit.
I'm going to get a job soon.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
So I can get a phone and talk to my girl.
I know you smoke.
Alright, Snoop.
That's what you get.
What'd you eat?
Oh, shit. My bad.
Alright.
What's that?
A book to learn magic.
'Cause it's not real magic.
What's real magic?
Like when you can change things with your mind.
I'll show you a magic trick.
I'll make this food disappear.
Alright, man. I'm out.
Alright.
Wait here for a second.
Say, Bill.
How'd you like to make another $100?
Shit, how so?
and I was hoping that you'd do me a favor
and head out to the truck, and swap out that tire for me.
Is it all yours?
Yep. It's all mine.
- I could do it for $200. - Okay.
Here's the thing, Bill.
Could you do that for me?
Somewhere on the rez, I think.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna need a little bit more than $200.
- How much more? - $400.
- $400? - And a job.
And a job?
What makes you think I got a job for you?
I mean…
You got two big houses, big 'ol land.
I'll tell you what.
but we can see about the job.
Yeah, well, I appreciate all that
I'mma have to pass.
I'll do $300
Yeah. Yeah.
Alrighty.
Check this out.
That's pretty cool.
I waited six fucking months for this little bastard, man.
They sent it to two or three P.O. boxes
before they finally got us.
Yeah.
Alright, little man.
See you later.
Alright. See you, Dad.
Yeah.
- My bad. - Fuck this guy.
Scared you shitless?
Here you go, bro. Check it out.
This here, my boy, is Epsom salt.

What the fuck?!
Yeah, that's my fucking son! What's good, bitch?!
You want some?
Right here then, WWE style.
Where were you?
I think I found a job.
Doing what?
Working for some white guy.
I made like 300 taking some people home.
I guess. But I'll be doing more stuff, too.
Well, good.
You could bail Carly. The kid would be happy.
- He already looks happy. - That's 'cause he's sleeping.
I saw you dance before.
You're a really good dancer.
Thanks.
Does it hurt?
I'll be gentle.
I wasn't talking about that.
What were you talking about?
Okay.
Come here.
Man, you're really goofy?
You still love me.
What makes you think I stole it?
The most goofiest shit I've ever heard.
I'm gonna tell everybody that she's yours
so I don't look like a pussy.
Fuck no, you better not tell nobody that's my dog.
- Why not? - Why would you even buy it?
'Cuz, you know, it's not just mine. It's yours too.
That's alright. She's hell a great, though.
She could make us rich.
Buy you that car. Buy you some new clothes.
I'mma get us a trailer and give you more baby boys.
Oh, you're a fucking rat.
- And you're beautiful. - Yeah?
You know.
So, what's up?
She wants you to come outside.
I want you to come outside. Please?
You're fucking crazy.
- You need some help? - No, I'm good.
All right.
Oh, shit.

Because you're gonna stay with me.
Oh, my God.
Fuck you! Look at me!

Fight back!
Fight back, bitch! Fight back!
You're a bitch! Fight me!
Fight back. Come on, son.
Hey, Bill!
Come on up!
Okay.
is sipping it slowly so you can enjoy it.
Oh, shit. Thank you.
Not really.
Probably just try to hang out with my kids.
- That's amazing. - So listen, Bill.
We own Fall River Farms
and I was thinking we could get you started over there
- because I know - So adorable.
You could do with more work.
Thanksgiving is obviously our busiest time of year
and we're providing to three new suppliers this year
- which is huge for us. - Huge.
- Yeah. - Yeah, Bill.
Yeah, because last year,
and, well, one of the employees pooped on our lawn.
Okay, honey. It wasn't a Mexican thing.
It was just a bad manners thing.
- No, he was Mexican. - He just happened to be Mexican.
That's not why-- I mean, come on.
Like I'm laughing, but at the time, it really wasn't that funny.
Look, someone shat on our lawn,
who happened to be Mexican, okay?
but we don't need to get into all that today.
Oh, my gosh. Who's this little doggie?
Oh, that's Beast. I'm breeding her,
trying to start my own business.
- You're just, you're so different. - He's smart, honey.
Unlike most of the other guys around here.
Oh, who is this?
Someone that's dead to me.
When did she die?
We just broke up.
I thought she died.
- Nothing. - Come on.
You must have done something.
Nothing at all, huh?
See, this is my new girlfriend. We also got a kid together.
Well, you want to hang onto that one, buy her lots of presents.
Tell her she's always right. Trust me with this.
Let me tell you something.
and give him something you don't wear anymore so he can give it to…
- What's her name, Bill? - Echo.
- Ethyl? - Echo.
- Echo? - Echo.
These I got from Alaska.
Cool.
- Why? - They have bad juju.
Me and Tim, we almost got divorced that trip.
We almost get divorced a lot, but…
Dreamcatchers.
These?
Thank you.
So, anything else?
- No, I'm alright. - Okay, great.
I got you this.
Okay.
No fighting in the house…
Go ahead and get comfortable. Pick a shelf.
Don't bring no drama into my tipi, okay?
Okay.
Thanks.
- Coffee time. - Thanks.
It ain't him.
Close.
I'm still mad at you.
I know.
But you love me.
Everything's gonna be different this time.
No, keep it.
Keep it.
You alright?
Yeah.
So how'd you get the job? Tim?
Yeah.
This is one turkey shed over here
- so beware. - Alright.
They're crazy, too. Rowdy.
Really rowdy. Been locked up 24/7.
- You got asthma? - No.
This is the layout.
The snipping.
The weighing.
Yeah.
Hello?
<i>Carly. Pick up the phone, bitch.</i>
Sit.
Come on, girl. Sit.
Beast. Please!
Sit.
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
She's not feeling great.
Like how? Is she okay?
That's not good.
Well, fuck.
Um, it's up to her.
Whatever she wants.
I think this is it.
Matho.
What?
Bro, I'm sorry to tell you this.
They found your dad in the creek.
I'm sorry.
I'm finally home.
I gazed upon the Lord's sweet, smiling face
I knew and felt His grace.
Can I have a cigarette?
Hey, I'm gonna head out.
Hey, Bill.
Come here. Share this glass with me.
Goddamn.
What's up?
Who the fuck let you out?
Long time, no see, bitch.
Shit.
What you mean, "Ugh?"
You're fucking weird, man.
What's that?
trying to act all brand new and shit.
I just got some acquired taste.
Oh, I gotta fucking throw up.
Man, I want my fucking money.
Come on, Bill. Get up.
- What? - Nothing.
Hurry up. I gotta go.
Who gave you all those hickeys?
Fuck!
Where's Beast?
Well, what about Carly?
Oh, my God.
Fucking idiot.
No.
Hello?
Yeah, I could do that.
Stop doing that.
Watch the fuck out!
What's up?
Hey, Matho.
Matho!
Boy, go on! Get out of here!
Don't run, now. Don't run. Relax, now.
Relax, now.
Let's find out what the trouble is.
Relax, now. Okay?
<i>It's Carly. Leave me a message.</i>
You want some turkey jerky?
No.
How short?
- Where's Carly at? - Jail.
- No. - No--
Motherfucker, my motherfucking dog!

You left me in jail to go buy a fucking dog,
Fuck you.
Come on.
I have to go find Beast real quick.
I'll be real quick. It'll take an hour.
You're such a butthead.
Shit, bro. You ever get tased?
Hello?
Hey, yo.
Yo!
What?
I don't fucking know, man.
I'm just looking for my dog.
there's nothing I can do for you.
Oh, all right.
Chill, bro. I'm gone, alright?
She had her babies? Yes!
Go. Go get the boys.
Goddamn.
Look what you did.
One, two, three, four, five…
six, seven, eight, nine.
Be quiet.
That's $18,000.
She's cute.
Look, it gots waves.
Where'd you go?
Hello?
The Bible tells us
to rejoice in hope
to be patient in tribulation.
God knows that, and so do we.
Fuck, I told them.
and they'll just put them on for free.
Let me have some.
Alright, man. I didn't have none.
It'll save all of us.
What's up?
Well, why have you been leaving me on seen?
Is it true you got suspended for meth?
- Who said that? - Thelma.
What'd you get suspended for?
Why do you care?
- Why? - Because she don't trust you.
Well, she don't even know me.
Tell her to invite me over.
Well, fuck you, bitch.
Why are you home from school?
What are my rules?
Don't lie.
Speak up.
Don't lie, don't fight, and go to school.
They called my house phone.
I'll work for you for free.
Excuse me?
But they didn't find anything. I hid it.
<i>I hope you guys enjoyed that.</i>
- Get out. <i>- You're listening to KILI radio…</i>
Can I eat first?
Fuck.
Fuck.
No, you're too fucking stupid to get mad at.
You're fucking boring.
or your fucking stupid stolen dog.
She's not stupid. You're stupid.
Alright. Well, text Tim. Tell him I'm gonna be late.
What do you mean, text Tim? Why don't you just text him
if y'all are so close?
I never said we was close.
- What's the deal? - That's not your business.
We just fucking kick it.
You just kick it? Okay.
So? That's not my place.
- Fuck. - What's wrong?
- She's about to trip. - What?
Fuck. Fuck. I don't like that kinda energy, bro.
- What? - What the fuck?
- Don't trip. - What?
What do you mean, don't trip?
Let's go. I'll explain.
- Explain what? - Beast got stolen.
What?
Come on, Beast got stolen.
- Who's in your car? - It's a girl from work.
- Come here. - I gotta fucking go!
Look at your fucking neck!
Man, you're fucking tripping.
- What? - What? What?
Let's fucking go!
What, with your other fucking bitch?
- Shut up! - Bitch, fucking…
- You fucking go! - Go!
This sacrifice, this ancient spell…
I hope the land receives it well.
And so beneath the moon's descent,
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
What happened right here?
Matho!
Yo, bro, I could ask my grandma if you can spend the night.
Bro, I'm good.
But bro, it's boarded up.
and go decorate it or something.
But where are you gonna get furniture, and all that stuff?
I only need some blankets and a TV.
you could get some plants, too.
Yeah, maybe from the dollar store or somewhere.
You shocked me…
Oh, motherfucker.
Damn.
Echo!
You locking me out now?
Beast had her puppies.
that I'm getting promoted at work too
so I'll have more money to help you.
Anything else?
So I could watch Mason?
- No. - I have a fucking kid, Bill.
What else would I be doing?
Well, let me watch him.
Yeah, let me watch him. It's Halloween.
Go out and have some fun.
Okay. That will help.
Thanks.
Yeah, you're welcome.
- Okay? - Yeah.
Love you.
You guys look great.
- Spooky. - Thank you. You too.
I'm Allison. Bill, you know me.
- Nice to meet you. - Alright, yep.
So, you could help these guys out.
- Yeah, man. - Alright then.
we have all these Halloween decorations…
Let's go.
Bro, let's go.
Man, you gotta have a mixer.
Oh, damn.
Just leftover back there.
Should I just sip or drink it?
Drink it.
Give me it.
Scared me.
What'cha doing?
Nothing.
Just looking for some bottles for upstairs.
Oh, okay. Well, don't let me interrupt you.
It's okay. It's not like…
We don't need to talk about it or anything.
Okay.
Because he has you, who lives at the rez and…
I don't know nothing about that.
Well, I do. I read his messages.
Like I said, I don't know anything about that.
But technically…
and you could go to jail for that.
You're not any different from them.
Let's go. Nobody saw.
What are we doing?
Where is she?
Okay.
Look for the blue bag.
She keeps all her guns and meth in there.
Wait, what are we getting?
Just find the blue bag.
Yes, yes, yes.
Hustle.
- This one. - Yeah! Let's go.
Holy fuck. Fucking fruit.
- I know. - Weirdo.
Fruits these days.
Swing it!
When you gonna pass it?
- Pass it back-- - Little Worm.
Where are we going?
Bro, let's go to Denver and sell all of this.
Where is Denver?
Holy shit!
Come on. Talk back there or something bro.
- It's pretty quiet. - I'm trying to roll.
I already know.
I already know.
You want some, huh?
Fuck.
Oh, bro. There's something to my arm.
My fucking head…
Bro, we gotta go.
- Then fucking leave! - Let's go. We gotta go.
Bro, we ain't taking responsibility for that.
Let's go.
Someone grab that blue bag.
Thanks, Bill.
This one's for me, and this one's for you guys.
- What about that guy? - What guy?
Well, I know Luis here doesn't…
It's a poodle.
Absolutely not.
Cynthia, devil woman, you want a poodle?
- No. - No?
No, man. I already got a dog.
All right.
Well…
I guess nobody wants a poodle, Bill.
Where did that kid get a poodle?
Oh, shit.
Yo, what the fuck, bro?
Shit, I'm sorry.
Where's my dog?
Are you okay?
What's going on, bud? Quit crying.
Aw, little guy.
Fuck, man. It's cold as fuck.
Beast!
- Beast! - Beast!
What was that?
Bill!
Yo, he shot my homie's dog.
Man, that's some fucking bullshit.
or I'll call the police.
You killed my homie's dog
Why are you in my face?
Go home, Bill.
Shay.
…and like maybe you should keep them.
And I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?
A sandwich?
I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
I'll make it for you.
Do you like coffee?
Well, you will whenever you grow up.
Who's calling, please?
- What's up? - What's up?
Sit down.
Okay.
Your dog killed one of the turkeys
and you punched my cousin in the face.
Okay. You get me 45 turkeys,
How's that? She didn't even do shit to 45 turkeys.
She killed one, but it was on accident
I don't know. You could always try getting a job.
Or you could steal them.
Or you could do a fucking rain dance.
You fucking killed my dog.
I worked them days, I chopped your wood
I cleaned your fucking closet,
Alright, are you done?
And we'll leave it at that.
Over here.
Ooh, yeah.
Let's go! Hurry up!
Oh, my God!
The Cleveland Browns host the Miami Dolphins.
That's my dad, Bobby Coleman.
Not how anyone expected his career to start.
Might have been his first fumble,
but it wasn't his last.
I turned six in Indianapolis.
Eight was in Chicago.
Bobby Coleman coughs up the ball
Then we were on to Jacksonville for my tenth,
but you can probably guess what happened.
And then the football comes loose.
The big 1-3 was in Minneapolis.
I wasn't there long enough to make friends,
Twelve years after that first fumble,
we ended up in Atlanta.
Keisha, why are you watching that?
Come on. Don't listen to 'em.
Listen to me.
because we've already moved so many times,
Look, I don't like picking up
and shuffling to a new city either.
I know one thing...
If Anderson Fisher wasn't on the team,
I'd definitely make the roster.
and maybe start thinking about what life might look like
Come on, baby.
But I can't take another trade.
So that better be look at this house,
- Okay. - Okay.
And back to the Lions.
Whoa!
Girl, that's my move.
I saw you in the reflection.
- You did? - Mm-hmm.
You really gotta step up your game.
If you wanna make the roster,
you gotta be at peak physical condition.
Uh-uh, no buts.
Look, we've been down this road before.
First it's cinnamon rolls.
Then I find you hoarding Oreos under the bathroom sink.
It's not very hygienic.
Everybody got their vices.
I'm just saying!
Am I wrong?
No, that's why I have a high OBR in Madden.
go outside.
and make a few friends. You know?
I know it hasn't been easy, all this moving around.
You mean it's not every girl's dream
- A fair hit. - Mm-hmm.
But I feel different about Atlanta, baby girl.
Yeah, I've heard that one before.
But it would be nice
to finally call a city home for once.
- Guess what? - Hmm?
I couldn't agree more.
I don't wanna keep being the reason we move.
Good.
- Oh, can I show you something? - Of course.
Okay, so I've been working on some predictive analytics
to help prepare you for your first game.
- Okay. - I catalogued
all the Falcons styles from the past season.
and coded an algorithm in Python that can predict...
What?
- Yes, Daughter, I'm listening. - Okay, so...

an ideal locker room guy for us.
I mean, wow.
you speak about was being used on the field, right?
Out there, not... in there. You know?

So, we were talking, and we were wondering, um,
- We're on a robotics team. - Yeah.
Robotics?
Like, you guys build robots?
Yep! I'm team captain.

I should warn you, Callie, she's mean on that Madden.
- Takes no prisoners. - Oh yeah?
She must be playing as me.
You know I got the overall 100 rating, right?
- You know, AF keep it 100! - Yeah.
Except nobody's got a perfect 100 rating in Madden.
Uh, Dad, he actually does.
Yeah, they're saying I'm the first one.
You know, pioneer and all of that.
Uh, what about you?
What's, uh... What's your rating?
Dang!
I mean, that's tough.

No, just messing with you, man.
I actually thought this rushing record
was gonna be yours the year you won the Heisman.

- You were my favorite player. - Yeah?
Yeah, don't doubt, man. We all loved you.
The whole fifth grade.
Yo, let me get those deconstructed cotton candies!
Whoo!
I warned you I was an expert in that.
Did this girl invent the game? How did you get this good?
I think the real question is how did you get so bad?

Hey, Dad. You gotta admit.
It's kind of funny that you lost by 86 points.
I mean, I've never seen it.
Well, look, I-I don't find the humor.
That was a direct attack on my entire person.
- Oh! Your entire person? - Yes, Keisha.

- He gave you what? - He signed it.
And he signed it?

Well, on the opening drive, Jim,
look for the Falcons to establish the run early today,
especially with Anderson Fisher,
who had a sensational rookie season last year.
Anderson Fisher, the young star,
looking to duplicate his success from last year.
And Taylor will start out in the gun, here,
and quickly some pressure off the edge,
and down he goes!
Taylor, oh my gosh!
Fisher, that's your assignment.
Mistakes are gonna happen.
Twenty, hut!
And they give it to Fisher.
what a tough start for Anderson Fisher.
I agree with Coach Evans here.
To miss pass protection on the first play
Here we go with the veteran Bobby Coleman.
A bold move, no doubt, Ton.
A surprising move.
So from the young buck to the veteran, Coleman here.
Third down for the Falcons.
Bobby's gotta move over, Jim.
Yeah, there ya go, Bobby.
Ready in motion, motion!
He's looking.
He has nobody down field open.
Coleman with a nice little sidestep.
Bobby Coleman is making some moves...
Ah! Oh, excuse me.
College, he was the guy.
He's got great in... stincts.
Runs into the wall!
No way!
He was so amped up.
I was right!
I can't believe it worked.
Bobby Coleman, his glory days being reclaimed
for a moment, here.
Yeah!
He's been the story so far today, Tony.
What is happening here?
Another sidestep, and there he goes!
One more time, folks!
Bobby Coleman, fourth touchdown of the day.
Even blowing a kiss to his wife, Keisha, in the crowd.
Bobby Coleman one more time.
But Bobby and the Falcons are playing better.
It's off the charts!
This time, Coleman splits out wide.
They throw it to him.
He's got three Panthers ahead of him.
What's he doing?
He's going backwards.
What a move!
He went backwards to go forwards.
And with touchdown number six,
He scored six touchdowns...
You were right, but... This wasn't part of the plan.
Look at this.
But after all that he's done in this game,
It's inspirational, Jim.
I mean, truly, this guy was on
the practice squad three days ago.
Whoo!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Yeah! Yeah!
That's how we play! That's how we play!
Listen up! Listen up.
Execution, determination, everything we talk about
Let me see that game ball.
Speaking of that, today,
a certain someone showed he still got some wheels.
And, and, and, and!
Some questionable dance moves.
Thank you.
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!
Those six touchdowns gave me life.
- Six! - Six!
I still can't believe it!
Oh, well you gotta believe it, baby.
See, 'cause Bobby Coleman is turning back the clock, baby.
Like you were possessed out there or something.
It did.
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

Yo, can I help?
No, just keep shooting pool.
Don't move at all.
You gotta fertilize yourself.
Nasty.
I'm coming back there.
Why? Why?
That's how he should look.
That's exactly how he should look.
What are you doing? That's my dad!
Whoa, relax.
Well, it's not!
I got my butt back!
What?
Oh, it's a Gen-Z thing.
I got my butt back!
What else did you change?
Wait, Nate, Nate, look. Um...
- Well, I... - You know what?
That's great.
But don't move. I made brownies to eat.
Hey, what's up?
Wanna tell me what happened to me today?
It was my friend.
All right, look, Anderson was real suspicious of me today.
All right.
But also, I was thinking...
Maybe we should chill on the whole Madden thing.
What are you talking about?
And with nationals and everything, I...
Callie, robotics? I got a shot at the Super Bowl.
A nice pool. A shed.
Hey, check it out. Look.
Your dad's on TV again!
You tell 'em, Bobby Coleman. That's what I told them.
That's my secret.
You know your mother.
- What's the problem? - I'm starting to feel guilty.
And for once, hey, baby girl, for once,
So let's not go rock the boat now.
No, no, no, Just keep doing what you're doing,
and you're doing it great.
Everything will be just fine, okay?
Okay.
Easy for you. I'm the one doing it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, Callie,
You're just pressing some buttons a little.
Just pressing some buttons? A little?
Babe!
I just hit a million followers! Ha!
to take on the Atlanta Falcons
in a game that is pivotal for each side
and just huge for the Falcons' playoff chances.
Well, they're going up against
one of the teams that people recognize around football
as one of the toughest teams in the league.
Taylor hands off to Coleman, who... whoa!
What is he doing?
We're all actually asking that because
Coleman is just running around in circles.
Stop messing around!
He's just lost.
And still running in circles, going absolutely nowhere.
Hold on a second.
It looks like he's changed course.
What is he doing now, Jim?
Tony, he's lost his mind. He's just jumping around.
Coleman is completely out of it.
He passes the ball.
Come on...
Oh!
Right in the face!
Coach Evans!
Exactly.
This isn't funny. He's out of...
Right now he's doing the Worm.
But you don't do the Worm.
To be precise, it's on the 46th yard line.
He's being ridiculous.
Hey, Fish time, baby!
I don't know what's happened.
This is not the same guy we've seen all season long.
on a football field.
which has been downright memorable
Callie, what are you doing?
You're the one doing everything!
I'm pressing some buttons to help out a little, right?
Okay, okay, you made your point.
so Anderson don't replace me. Please.
Coleman! Come on.
Coming, Coach! Get my helmet.
Lesson learned, all right? Okay, thanks, bye.
Okay.
Uh oh.
Hi.
Callie...
We've been talking.
Screw lead-ins.
You promised us a new robot arm.
You called it SpongeBot 2.0,
Everything is coming together, though.
I'm just working on it at home.
Nate knows! Right, Nate?
Actually, I don't.
Um...
Okay, well...
Callie, we were counting on you.
Look, look, stop with this dad stuff.
And what happened to wanting to be Callie Coleman
and not Bobby Coleman's daughter?
You might not need these scholarships
that money could actually make a huge difference!
I'm gonna need that iPhone case back.
And the T-shirt too.
Fine.
But maybe, if anyone actually knew
what they were doing on this team,
this wouldn't be a problem!
There is no better story in the NFC
He ain't all that.
With a record-tying six touchdown game.
Yeah... I did it first.
I mean, you just wanna root for this guy, right?
Especially when you see him with his daughter.
Those two make quite the couple.
Oh, it's adorable.
playing a whole lot of Madden.
Man, I love that they play Madden together.
The way Bobby's been playing,
it seems he's leveled up in real life.
It does seem like that, doesn't it?
But he might be getting
It's like Anderson who, right?
That's her exact same schedule.
Hold up.
Those are the exact same plays.
That's crazy, no.
Thank you.
Callie!
- I'll check on her. - Okay.
All right.
Put the controller down now.
I finally felt like I belonged somewhere
and now all my friends hate me.
What are you talking about?
Callie, we're dominating! You're kidding me?
I'm having the best season of my career!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
No. No.
Gotta go to Best Buy, right?
They... they... they can recover the data.
Come on, leave it alone!
Don't... Dad, what are you doing? It's over! It's over!
- Dad, look, stop! - Hey!
No, Callie, I'm taking it! Give me the game!
Callie, Callie!
No!
Mom, whatever I do in the game, it happens in real life.
That's the reason Dad's been playing so well!
Callie Amber Coleman, is that what you think?
It's true. It's true, Keish.
I know it does sound insane,
but the game has some sort of power over me.
But we'll come back to that.
is that whatever Callie does in a video game,
Bobby mirrors on the field move for move.
How could you two keep something like this a secret?
but Dad said not to...
Wait, wait, wait, you're sorry about that?
How 'bout the fact that you just made all of my skills disappear?
Gone, poof, just like that!
That's literally all you care about!
Callie... Baby girl...
This was a win/win for both of us.
And all our dreams were finally coming true.
Your dreams!
But what about me?
Not everything is just about you!
You told our daughter to lie to me?
- Listen, Keisha... - No.
What happened to us being a unit?
I mean, I get it. You're Mr. Bigshot on the field.
But in this house? We're partners.
And right now... it sure doesn't feel that way.
- I mean, Keisha... - No.
Callie!
♪ Yeah, well you the GOAT
Coleman!
Where's Bobby?
I know your secret.
Check it out, Joe.
When his daughter plays Madden,
it makes him good at actual football.
Yo, no offense, but what?
Look, I don't know how you're doing it,
but I got proof. I got proof!
His daughter recorded her Madden gameplay,
a few months back.
- Hey, I just leveled up! - Scoot over.
- Come on, now! - What you doin'?
Give the controller back.
What's wrong, man?
What you doin'?
What?
She recorded it.
Right? It was the same on Madden, too!
Admit it, Bobby!
Boom! Busted!
Wake up, fam!
In, like, one day he went from rickety old man
to some kind of superhero overnight?
What do you think caused that? Multivitamins?
It's a Gen Z thing.
Hey, hey.
Right, AF?
Just play ball.
- I'm not crazy, y'all. - You sound crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not going insane.
It was on the game!
Man, shut up! I'm with Bobby.
That boy crazy, man.
Yeeeaahhh!
It's starting, if you wanna watch!
I'm good!
Taylor, the quarterback.
And they'll hand it off to Coleman.
But the Falcons do keep possession.
Now they throw it to Coleman.
And it goes directly through his hands.
Bobby!
Jim, as I suspected, Bobby Coleman's going out
and Anderson Fisher's coming in.
You can't blame him.
Yeah, well, technically, Jim,
he hasn't looked like himself all season.
I mean, he started off on fire.
that we've seen throughout most of his NFL career.
Isn't this the worst?
What?
And he can test me...
I never wanna see him struggle.
And we both know he's had his struggles.
You never stop rooting for them.
Thanks to Anderson Fisher,
Looks like his so-called resurgence
was just a fluke.
Pathetic!
I say just retire.
Keisha? Look, I apologize...
Not now. I can't find Callie.
for two hours.
Has she mentioned any plans?
Okay.
Excuse me? Hi. We're Callie's parents.
Wait, he was at our house? When was this?
Not now, not now. We're looking for Callie.
Yeah, see, she was supposed to figure out
this big element of our robot, but...
No offense to Mr. Coleman...
that she didn't really have much time left for us.
we even made it to the nationals.
we are completely screwed.
Uh, sorry for the language.
It's just I don't think we're gonna find another Callie
And sorry.
Callie! Callie!
I'm trying to fix this!
- Baby girl, no! - Baby, this is insane.
I mean, everything was great until I ruined it.
No, you said it... we're a team.
You've already given me so much. You have!
- all for me again. - But football is your life!
No, baby. No! You're my life.
You led your team to nationals!
No, no, no, that's no me too, okay?
I didn't think about how it affected you.
I'm sorry.
So I'm here, present.
No, hey, come here, come here. Come here.
We really need to get out of this rain
because we're going to get pneumonia.
Please come over.
Mom, pneumonia's a little extreme.
Worst-case scenario, it's probably just the sniffles.
Please, just trust me. I am a medical professional.
- Good morning! - Whoa!
What?
Yeah. This isn't about me. Today is not about me.
- Come on! - Dad, Dad, stop.
We gotta go. Hey, hey!
You drivin', Miss Thing.
Breakfast on the table. Let's rock!
Yeah, I do.
You get this thing done,

Nope.

But we don't have to do that.
- Way better. - Okay.
- Win-win. - Yeah.

You were relying on me, and I didn't deliver.
But y'all mean everything to me.

Right.

Jim, the energy here at Mercedes-Benz
is electric. A sold-out crowd

That's right, partner.
And all eyes are on Bobby Coleman,
who's had the Cinderella season.
But he came out last game looking like Sleeping Beauty.
Yes, but even after that performance,
But the big question is, will Coach Evans
give him the minutes he needs to do it?
- These seats are incredible! - Okay.
This season's been a little different.
Yo, I'll take a dog! Oh, dog, you want a dog?
Make that double dog! With kraut.
Everybody gets a sign.
I should've brought you one too.
It's okay, honey.

Coach Evans going with Bobby Coleman.
And Coleman, right off the bat,
is hit hard for a loss.
Well, the Saints are not gonna
make this easy for Bobby Coleman.
Get it together, Bobby! They're crushing you out there!
- Your mom is a little... - Passionate?
And now the Saints head to the end zone on a quick strike.
And it's caught. Touchdown, Falcons.
Taylor with a perfect throw.
That's how you gotta score against this defense.
Handoff, Coleman. And he fumbles it.
And the Saints recover.
All of last week's troubles not quite behind him.
Saints are feeling comfortable in enemy territory.
And oh, Coleman once again coughs it up.
That's it. Coach Evans says you're done.
I'm going to Anderson Fisher.
And Fisher looking like he did last year.
Into the end zone for sixth.
You gotta let it out, man.
Come on, scream with me.

They're trying to get lined up.
Look at this.
42!

Well, Comeback Coleman has had
an unbelievable season.
But Anderson Fisher, he seems to be more reliable right now.
42!
Time out!
Zeros and ones.
Yeah, yeah, I'm not following.
The patterns are finite. So if you gather enough data,
are more or less efficient against others.

May, let's say "hi" to everybody!
Tell everyone how exciting
Oh my god, it's so wonderful when I think about it.
Why?
Gucci, Prada, Chanel. Wait for us!
Alright, we're not here for that.
The trip started with a car crash.
What does he want? Money? Go give him some!
Go talk with them.
Hurry up!
Oh my, you understand?
That's an insult.
Sorry for that.
It's special!
Tay?
There's only one guy, I'll handle it.
Just enjoy it!
Hold on!
Two people.
Three.
Hello, Miss,
everything for your trip has been arranged.
Please send back the money they paid us.
Don't look at Park's photos so much.
That's right. It's unbelievable.
Because Park hasn't had dinner with anyone like that.
But don't worry.
No matter how hard it is,
We have three days left to prepare.
What?
Everything's ready.
How?
I want to,
how could we do it?
You have to accept the truth.
But we can't buy feelings with money.
That's right,
I'll make Park really want to celebrate my birthday
with his real feelings.
Like that?
Are you ready to follow the call of love?
Ready.
But I have to wear these clothes?
Oh, they are all expensive!
It's okay to wear casual clothes.
Get me something else.
Where do we buy things in Bangkok?
Well, you mean you want to wear Platinum's hi-end fashion?
That's easy.
Hey, how do we deter those guards?
We can handle normal people.
But Dong is difficult to run away from.
I guess Nanny told them to come.
Dua Hau! Why don't you say something?
Dua Hau…
Nanny…
Why are you here?
Why can't I be here?
Because four bodyguards might not be enough.
Four people are not enough?
Didn't you want me to come?
It's not that.
Problems?
Sure.
Yes.
You've been like a mother to me since I was little.
It's great to have you with us.
Cheer, cheer.
This outfit is good.
What is it?
Today we are on a nine-temple tour.
Ladies and gentlemen,
when Thai people come to temple,
they pray for peace,
health for their families.
The two back doors are for monks and nuns.
Back door.
May,
your birthday is soon, right?
No, for what?
You must do it.
Well, the light in this sanctuary will lead you to happiness.
Your wishes will become real.
So, please, allow me to have a little blessing.
Great, come on.
Mom.
People say that the blessings should not be disturbed.
So let May go alone.
No one's bothering you.
Well,
So if too many people go inside
See, so everybody please wait outside.
I'm going with May by myself.
Crashed?
Anything broken?
No.
Broken?
I'm okay.
Just kidding, good to see you're fine.
Did he take responsibility?
One million Thai baht.
Are you stupid?
Calm down.
Must be really calm.
There's a monk. Calm down, go in.
Look.
Buddha loves us. Park is not far from here.
Who's that?
The motorcycle guy from yesterday.
He said he's very busy.
Let me talk to him.
This number?
Yes.
You don't know the drill.
Hey… That's not okay.
It's okay.
Act like you can understand.
Just for fun, no biggie.
Hello.
Where's May?
The monk is focusing on the blessing.
Okay.
Where's the mistress?
Oh my god, let me tell you something.
The monk is unbelievable.
When May and I went in.
Then he said May was having bad luck.
It takes about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes.
But during the ceremony, no one can interrupt.
Because if we do, it will be broken.
It's very bad luck.
You are just so full of bullshit.
It's really here.
There must be a mistake.
Hello, what's up?
But I'm not in Saigon.
You guys go first.
Okay.
Hello.
Really?
Okay, go.
It's been 17 minutes since Dua Hau came out.
I'm going inside to see how the monk works.
You can't. I told you, the monk is doing the ceremony.
Don't you remember,
the tour guide told us,
Just the slightest breath can startle the monk.
Right?
I'm your subordinate?
Obsessive star follower.
Found it.
Here.
I'm confused or she is?
Ayuthaya is very far.
What now?
This way, please.
Wait, I'm going to call the mistress.
Don't go, please.
we can't interrupt.
Alright, it's okay.
Well, excuse me.
The tour rule is not to overstay for more than five minutes.
Park is very handsome, isn't he?
I didn't meet him.
Why?
You feel better, don't you?
Great.
He's waiting outside, it's 500 dollars.
500 dollars?
What's up?
I want to pee.
I bought this for you.
Okay.
Chris!
Haven't got any guys lately?
Yong! Call me Christy.
Understood?
This can be a guarantee, food from a guy.
Really? Boy?
Yes.
Better to go to find something free to eat.
I'm going P'Christy… Sak.
Crazy asshole.
Grandma, I'm back.
Grandma, I'm back too.
Hello, Uncle and Aunty.
Can I have dinner with you today?
Hello, ancestors.
Boy.
Grandma…
Was that Pim?
Yes, she is coming.
Grandma, you have dinner first. Just ignore him.
Boy?
Grandma, let's go to eat.
Sit here, be careful.
500.
500?
I think this is two or three times that already.
Dollars.
500 dollars.
Dollars?
One dollar equals 30…
Oh, Boy, you've got 20,000 Thai baht?
Yes, almost.
<i>Hoi jo</i> is Yong's favorite.
Go wash your hands first.
Go wash your hands before eating.
Grandma, can I get one bit, please?
Okay, wash hands first.
She is fine.
I bought your favorite.
You berated her.
But she still gave you that much?
that she came to Thailand to meet her idol?
What?
Spoiled fangirl.
Is she beautiful?
I think she is very much a kid.
How can I meet this kind of girl?
You have to learn English first.
It's fine.
Okay?
Okay.
When will you tell Grandma the truth about your mom?
If your parents were still alive,
and then become a photographer.
When everything settles down.
I hope you can soon.
Damn it.
May, I'm sorry.
I have something for you.
See? Finally we have a chance.
Hello?
What ring?
I didn't have cash.
Who wants you?
Hello.
Are you ready?
Are you okay?
Robber! That guy!
Robber!
- Oh, my! Robbery! - What!
Robber! Oh my god!
Where is May?
May!
Find her, now!
Just a lousy bag.
Excuse me, make way!
Arrest me?
Jail.
Damn it.
Bro…
Snatch her bag.
Who hired you?
Done?
Mine too?
I almost died…
I've been working for this family for 20 years.
Why do those people have to follow?
No need to tail her everywhere.
But is that called trust?
Please don't use me as your purpose.
You just do it for yourself.
You want to live in a rich family.
An easy job with high pay.
Having parents that are only good at making money.
But I did all that because I love you.
I care for you.
All right!
You disobeyed me today. But we'll leave it for now.
More on that later.
But now…
You want everyone not to follow May, right?
Pack your things and fly back to Vietnam.
Hello, this is free gift.
Park.
Welcome.
Sorry, you cannot enter.
It's only for those who have a ticket.
is playing the game over there.
There.
We know that the tickets sold out unexpectedly.
Come this way.
Many fans are waiting to get inside.
But we have a special game for special winners
to get a ticket to go inside.
Our game is 'Ring throwing to find Park'.
Only one chance to throw.
But we only have three tickets left.
Three tickets.
Please stand in a row.
Good luck, everybody.
Also welcome to our old fans.
Hello.
Grandma,
I already ate.
That was lunch.
I bought Kuoy Jab for dinner, your favorite food.
Pim.
Are you tired?
Grandma.
Boy, take a photo for me and your mom.
Can you, Grandma?
Beautiful.
Well, you're probably tired today.
We have a sightseeing tour tomorrow.
Because if not,
Sis! I'm sorry.
You're in trouble because of me.
Every time something happens,
you're the one who protects me.
Luckily, May is safe.
I find it getting worse and worse.
But what was Dua Hau thinking?
Maybe of a special birthday for May.
So much that he forgot the important mission?
Well… Cheers.
No more work chit chat, please. Cheers!
Do you know what's most important?
What?
Yes, sir. Exactly.
But you should remember one thing.
Being human,
everyone has the urge to "pursue happiness."
Dua Hau is just helping her.
to support May to that extent
is reckless.
Don't forget who we are.
We're just bodyguards.
Now I want to ask. You…
If May was in danger,
Yes, sir!
the top.
You're right, Bac.
we'll never get what we want.

So we're going to have a substitute.
But he can't speak Vietnamese.

God, let's get some Thai massage.

Sorry. Did you see this lady?
No?
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Nanny! I can't find her.
Did you see her?
She's gone.
Oh, my god!
That's our tour guide.
Okay.

Let's go home, Grandma.
Boy.
How's your grandma?
Boy, where are you going?
Hello.
Where are you going, handsome guys?
Speak English.
Boy.
Yong.
Do you know these three guys?
They still can't find May.
I booked a car to the airport.
Thank you.
Tell me.
Nothing.
How come Boy was with that girl?
Well…
Can you tell them, if we can contact Boy
You're sure?
I'm sure.
But why me?
Hurry up, they're looking at us.
Nam's just called. Nanny wants us back at the hotel.
But, we haven't found the mistress.
We have to do like she said.
Tell him we'll be back when we find her.
Yes.
Hello.
I think you should tell your guy
that he's doing it wrong.
You taught me…
happiness is simply doing what you like
and seeing the one you love.
<i>Right, mom?</i>
Right there.
Hello!
Hello!
Stupid person.
Stupid person.
Stupid person.
You're adorable!
You're adorable!
I like you.
I like you.
May, I like you.
I covered my face, good.
Ma'am.
We have to buy new tickets
because the previous flight has just taken off.
As soon as we find May,
I have just started work here.
Nanny.
Dua Hau…
Mistress.
He gave this to you.
Stick your eyes on her.
Why blame me?
You're the one who forget a crucial thing on the first day of school.
Here.
Thanks.
I will pay for your dinner.
You promise?
Wait.
Hello.
Boy.
What?
Look.
Yong, may I borrow your motorbike?
Okay.
Boy.
Boy.
My motorbike is parked at the back.
You can go and take it.
Boy, you left me again, bad friend.
I like you.
Hi.
No.
You can speak Thai?
Surprise…
Cut?
Yes.
Congratulations.
Grown up into a girl.
Oh gosh!
Cheers!
Cheers!
This time…
across West, Central and Southern Africa,
Over the centuries, there has been many assumptions about MAMI WATA.
Until now.
Zinwe!
Zinwe!
I’ve been hearing that since I was little.
You're the Intermediary in Iyi.
What can't you do?
How do you refuse to help that woman?
Mother...
If it was me...
When I become the Intermediary,
I will abolish all this foolishness from Iyi.
You're a marine child, too, Zinwe.
I was infertile...
That's when MAMI WATA gave you to me.
That's the way things are.
I can't believe...
that you would lie...
just because you want to remain Intermediary.
Aja!
"Zinwe, let's go home."
There's fewer people coming...
They come to say "Ndenk" (Thank you).
So they can leave with blessings.
I didn't start it.
Zinwe,
let's go home.
Our people need you.
You know you'll be the Intermediary.
Iyi...
I can't take Zinwe anymore.
That child doesn't listen.
Iyi no longer believes in Mother.
What do you want, Prisca?
What you want, it counts.
The people of Iyi are my people.
I don't know anything beyond this place.
That's all I want.
Let's dance.
Can I enter?
You know that I scream...
- No, Mother is sleeping... - Okay...
"She no longer has any power."
Where are you going?
You say you have powers...
Show us!
Where is MAMI WATA's power? Where is it?
And you give everything. But when you need help...
Listen, other villages have progressed!
They have electricity...
They have schools...
They have running water...
They have hospitals that would have been able to save Agbo's son!
And what do we have?
We have Mama Efe.
Mama Efe!
Is it true that Zinwe stole your totem and ran away?
"Maybe she has answered us."
I am Mama Efe.
She is Prisca.
She is the one who saved you.
You are in Iyi.
administering these vaccines...
And your daughter invited us to administer them to your people...
We received an unfortunate report, involving a young boy...
God rest his soul...
There is no virus in my village.
- Yes, but you see... - No "But" Mister Doctor!
Protected, you say? How so?
All you men of Western science...
What do you know beyond your books?
You know nothing about the worlds beyond what you can see with your eyes!
Mother...
This man is a doctor who wants to save our children...
...so they won't die.
Doctor...
I know you allowed him to give his medicine to our people.
Don't worry.
Maybe she has answered us.
This food is delicious.
Prisca prepared it.
Since I've been here, there's something that I have noticed in your village
...and no army, or police, as far as I can see.
when we have MAMI WATA?
It's MAMI WATA who gives us food, and everything we need.
They've forgotten who they are.
But here in Iyi, we know who we are.
But you still haven't told us who you are.
Mother...
I will speak...
My name is Jasper.
We are the ones they call "rebel".
How you saved me and brought me to this beautiful place...
And the Princess...
...gave me this delicious meal to eat.
I... I wanted to thank you...
Or, as you say... "Ndenk". (Thank you)
Still, I appreciate it.
Don't be offended. It's a compliment.
There is something I didn't tell you two...
The rebels, they...
killed my wife
...after they had raped her.
- Prisca! - Hello!
Your people really love you...
It's really beautiful...
You're lucky to live here...
I wish I could live here...
My body is all healed up.
If they hadn’t sent me away, I would be dead.
Mama Efe adopted me and brought me to Iyi.
Some say that MAMI WATA gave Zinwe to Mama Efe...
And, no one knows who Zinwe's father is.
You know how these things go...
What do you believe?
Maybe Zinwe's father has a wife...
Better not say I told you that.
If Zinwe is truly MAMI WATA's...
I'm just surprised that you don't believe the things your Mother believes.
I don't know what I believe...
All I know is my mother and my people...
Anything else, doesn't concern me.
"No prayer can change it."
You are Jasper?
Fancy a drink?
Enjoy.
Look at them.
And give it all to Mama Efe
So she can enjoy it with her daughter, in their big house.
Mother!
[mumbles incoherently]
Where are you going?
Mother...
Zinwe's destiny...
lies beyond here...
No prayer...
No prayer can stop it.
No prayer... No prayer can change it.
As it is...
My time is up.
I was dreaming...
And in my dream...
It's Prisca, who annoys me the most...
She drives her motorcycle like she poops gold from her ass.
What annoys me the most, is her devotion to MAMI WATA.
In a war...
They will speak...
...willingly go into battle.
They are the worst.
What I know is, their time will soon come!
The time has passed where they use MAMI WATA to blind people's eyes.
Me... I see...
I see... very clearly...
There's someone there!
Run...
There's someone there!
Help Zinwe to see.
Run! Run! Run!
I told you that their time has come.
Get the children out of here.
Get out!
You don't know what you're doing.
You say you're the Intermediary...
She doesn't know!
MAMI WATA didn't tell her!
Jasper...
Is this how you treat...
the person who saved you, and took you into their home...
You join those who want to kill her.
I follow no one... I only follow myself.
- Everything you're saying... - Mama Efe!
Your time has come.
We want progress.
- Your time has come! - Yes!
Jasper, are you coming?
Lots of good stuff inside!
We own this place now.
In short, we own this village now!
But since I'm not a wicked man,
I'll allow you all to continue living here.
We've counted them.
So, you two can choose who you like.
But Mama Efe's room belongs to me and you.
I'm the boss here.
If anyone has a problem with that, they should speak now.
Zinwe is back!
- Please... run away... - Please don't go...
Zinwe...
Welcome back... Oh Queen.
Mama Efe is no more.
Wait!
Mama Efe and all the Intermediaries before her
have bamboozled you with stories of MAMI WATA.
But have you seen her?
Has anyone here seen her?
When sickness comes, she can't save you...
And I hear she takes your food, your money...
Is that fair?
Jabi told me that you want electricity, running water, roads, schools, hospitals.
You know that Mama Efe could never give you all that.
Mama Efe is dead...
Prisca has run away, abandoning you all, right?
But Zinwe is here.
Now, if she's going to be the Intermediary,
and if truly MAMI WATA exists
as you've been told by Mama Efe
If that happens, then truly Zinwe is the Intermediary...
But if we throw her into the water, and she doesn't come out...
There's a reason why I'm here.
I'll be here... But not like Mama Efe.
I killed your mother.
MAMI WATA foolishness!
Whatever! Is that MAMI WATA?
It is all nonsense!
- What's inside? - Bullshit!
Bring your money, and goods...
...and your goods!
Bring your money...
...and your goods!
Bring your money, and goods!
Ndenk
We will use this to purchase better weapons.
What kind of weapons?
Where is Jasper's house?
Johnny Boy!
Big man Jasper!
Seems like you're doing well.
Hey, careful, big man.
There you go again.
That man killed our mother... and would have killed you...
I know that.
While those who claim to be my people stood and watched.
You are not afraid, Prisca.
What I know is that...
We will fight and win against Jasper and his men.
And you, Zinwe...
...will be the Intermediary in Iyi.
"Blessings have died in Iyi."
What? Did I ask you to enter?
Why is the food rotten?
Blessings have died in Iyi.
Boss Jasper!
"They deceived everyone in Iyi."
- Prisca! - Ero...
I thought you ran away from Iyi.
We buried your mother.
But Jasper cast it away.
I know you're mad at me...
...for being with him.
Please...
...forgive me.
They deceived everyone in Iyi.
...build hospitals...
...bring electricity.
So the people gave them their money and their goods...
But Jasper used them to buy many guns.
I saw that.
...all this would not have happened.
My mother would still be alive.
They killed Zinwe.
Please, don't be mad at me...
I wanted to fight...
It's like when a person dies, and resurrects...
So truly, MAMI WATA saved her.
- Prisca! - I choose Prisca!
Go Zinwe!
Isn't that Prisca's bike?
That's Prisca's bike!
Is Prisca here?
Prisca is here? You! Upright!
Where is Prisca? Speak!
Hello, Prisca.
What is this foolishness?
I will admit...
And with you.
Where is the electricity, schools and hospitals
he promised he would bring?
Put down your weapons...
Go down.
Jasper is a woman!
Jabi... you were afraid of him. He is a woman!
Jasper, show us your pussy!
Prisca...
It belongs to you...
What belongs to me?
The totem...
You're supposed to wear it...
Mum always knew it would be you...
...that would be the Intermediary.
And not me...
You think I'll fear you, because you wear that thing?
I'm not afraid of women!
Ask the other woman who is in the ground.
Jabi...
It's damn hot outside.
Tomy, my boy!
Okay... Good morning...
Move please, Spu!
Oh... everything goes wrong if it's an emergency!
Let's ring the bell.
Open the door for him.
Come, fast!
Okay... Thank you.
He is early today.
Hey, stop. Tomy!
Stop.. No... Let me go. He is not at all obedient now.
Tomy, I'll take you. Roy sir...
Can't sniff when you need it badly.
What a relief!
Tomy, are you done?
Come here.
Yes.. Yes.
Come here... come here.
Daddy can't play today, dear. My back is cramped.
You gave the same excuse yesterday too!
Ganesh, give me the tick spray.
Tomy's body is full of ticks.
I don't need any spray.
Look, did you see this one?
I brought her just for our Tomy.
Oh, not again.
To cross with my Tomy, I want the best breed around.
Right, Tomy?
Of course!
I need not teach you about dogs.
Not really, Shafi.
What are you staring at?
I'm Julie.
What?
Hey, no.
Forget it.
What's her lineage?
Her mom is south zone champion. Scored a hat-trick.
Really?
What?
Hey, not him. He is her master, Tippu.
Very well.
Dude, I want to know who her current owners are.
All that can be managed, sir.
Tipu sir, come here.
His head, beard and dirty spitting...
See, sir... He doesnt care about money.
What were you thinking?
That I would make my Tomy cross with dogs from such lousy households?
Mukesh sirâ¦ Sorryâ¦ Tipu sir.
Doesn't look like it'll work. Let's leave.
Shut the gate when you leave.
Didn't get you.
I don't care about body or coat.
I'll get you bitten.
Cheap fellow!
No treat for me?
Oh, thanks.
Come, dude.
This is not for you. It's for Roy.
Don't stare. Didn't you eat dry food just now?
I'll give you food when it's time.
Please...
Go... play.
Roy Pa...
Don't mind what she says.
You eat.
Have it.
Good boy.
Wanted some more onion.
Stray dog menace in the city again.
Industrialist and Street Dog Action Committee president Mr. Narendar Das told this channel.
These street dogs, my goodness. To ruin the peace!
Due to the street dog menace, common people are afraid to go out on the roads these days.
Yesterday, a 4-year old child was badly hurt in their attack.
If the authorities don't take appropriate action swiftlyâ¦
we may have to find a solution in our own way.
Not a good way to start the day.
Needed one more step here.
Hey Tomy, look here man.
Didn't hear your wake-up call this morning.
Not sure why, dude. My throat is not alright since last two days.
Ah, forget that. Saw a female dog here in the morning.
What's cooking?
True that.
I've been noticing it.
What?
That your precious life can't be shared with a random female dog.
Amalu..? You brat!
Damn. How did the rooster notice all these?
Amalu...
What?
Wow. My Amalu. She is only mine.
Gorgeous!
Of course, she is.
Amalu...
Hey, turn this side. It's me, Tomy.
Oh, she is coming to me.
Shucks, should've carried a flower for her.
What's up, Tomy?
Yeah... Amalu...
Oh, that?
Saraswathi Sis bathed me with a new shampoo today.
Didn't you bath today, Tomy?
My shampoo is strawberry flavoured. Itis imported.
Tomy was smelling bad when he came near me.
His shampoo is over, sir.
Take the Radhika soap from the cupboard.
Bathe him with that for now.
It got over just this morning.
Wanna see the new tricks that Roy Pa taught me?
Jesus!
Amazing, Tomy!
Good, but how will this help?
That.. I don't really know what's the use.
Roy Pa taught me this.
I'll leave now, Tomy. Ta ta!
I should've learned to say proper goodbye.
I really love the fragrance of Radhika soap.
What?
Amalu loves Tomy bro!
Thank you.
Âa Close... closer to me as a companion âa
âa You, in all my seven lives âa
âa Inside... Deep inside my heart âa
âa As you come like shyness that blinks its eyes âa

âa You alone, transforming to music âa
âa I yearn to caress you as moonlight âa
âa Close... closer to me as a companion âa

It's daybreak..!
Oh god!
I looked after Amalu like my own baby.
The Christian guy's dog meets her every night!
Yes, they do. She is not just Amalu but Amalu lyer!
What?
Not sure how you brought her up, Granny. But I'm bringing her up as a normal dog.
If you don't teach your daughters discipline. Youâ'l have to bear all these
Why did you mingle with that fish-eating Christian dog.
Granny, please leave at least Amalu out of such things.
Amma, what you want now?
That dog should not enter the compound. Is that all, right?
I'll discuss it with Roy!
Amalu, you come here.
Come on. Tomy, come... open...
Yes, open.. Open.. handle. Yes... Very good!
Yes, got it. Very good!
So easy!
Very good.
Isn't it Swamy uncle?
What happened, sir?
Tomy doesn't go out of this gate without us.
No, Roy. I verified CCTV.
Even the grandma saw him.
I'm dead!
After all, they are neighbours.
Take it easy.
Roy, the thing is...
We've planned a crossing for Amalu with a dog of the same breed.
What?
I hope you understood.
Swami sir...
Yeah.
Exactly.
Well said, Roy Pa.
Well, that's up to you.
This dog should not enter my compound.
Lock him up.
What? Lock him?
He's the kind that will escape even if you lock him up.
See Swami...
If your dog enters the compound again or goes near Amaluâ¦
Then, I can't tell you what would happen.
Stop threatening and leave, Swamy.
I'll look after Tomy.
Swami, you can leave.
Roy Pa said it in rage. Don't take it seriously.
He was speaking about you. Go to him.
Get inside, idiot.
Is what he said true?
Err... No... Roy Pa... That is...
Dad... Dad...
This is the first time we're locking her up for a whole night.
I feel sad.
Amalu...
Amalu...
Amalu...
What? What happened to her?
She seems unwell.
Amalu...
Tomy... Tomy, look here. Tomy!
Tomy
Tomy
No... I meant Amalu is pregnant.
We don't want his puppies in this house.
I don't think we can do all that now.
If we do it, we'll be risking Amalu's life
I can see a growth of at least two to three weeks.
What is this, son?
Amalu...
Amalu...
Tomy
You..!
Come here, now!
Amalu...
Come, dammit!
Come with me!
I'll come and take Amalu home tomorrow.
We'll think about the rest in due course.
You decide.
Don't let her in today.
Come here!
People laugh at me now.
Come, dammit.
Sir!
Come, you!
Roy Pa!
Come dammit.
You brought us shameâ¦ Lie there for a few days.
Feed him just once a day, don't let him out.
If he comes out of this room, I'll throw you out of this house.
Amalu
I don't see any way to get you out of this.
Dad will be very angry.
What mischief have you done after all?
Let me request Dad and try to release you tomorrow.
You take rest now.
Tomy... Tomy.
Dude, look here.
Come.
Rooster bro...
You did it, naughty boy!
Congratulations!
They locked her up yesterday. Today it's my turn.
Did we commit such a grave sin?
These humans are like that, man.
Yesterday, Ammini was telling...
Hubby is coming from abroad.
So, should we fry him or make curry? Bloody old hag!
Honestly, I felt like running away from here.
Rooster bro, did you see Amalu?
Yes, man.
She is lying in that cage.
She looks weak. Not eating at all, I guess.
But they've locked you up in this.
I know how to open this.
But how can I do it without Roy Pa's permission?
Dude, open the door and go to her.
Don't think too much.
Go, dude. Go.
Run away somewhere far with her.
Come back after a few days when you have kids.
They will accept you. That's how it is among humans.
I'll open it then.
Jesus!
Sorry, Roy Pa.
Oh, more stairs!
Can't see a thing.
My God!
Will Ganeshan wake up?
I should move carefully.
Sorry, Roy Pa.
Shit.
This is locked.
This guy always forgets to lock his door.
Jesus!
It shouldn't be dawn soon.
Okay...
Hey, Tomy... Dude...
What?
Be careful.
Dude, don't make me more sad.
See you soon.
Amalu...
Yeah?
Tomy?
Tomy, where were you?
Roy Pa locked me up, Amalu.
He was furious at me.
Even Saraswathi Sis is not setting me free.
No, Tomy. I haven't gone anywhere without Saraswathi Sis.
Same here.
Even I haven't stayed away from Roy Pa till now.
We'll come back.
But I'm locked up, Tomy.
Come.
Yeah.
Amalu...
Hurry up.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll protect you from whatever comes in our way.
Hmm? Answer me!
- Bro, listen. - What?
If you irritate us with such nasty talk...
I'll bite, scratch and tear you into pieces.
Sister, don't misunderstand me.
You guys carry on.
What a bad impression that girl must've got about me?
I need to undergo a cultural refinement.
Chunku...
Sleep this side.
Amalu..! Tomy..!
Ganesh...
Sir, I had checked on him before going to bed.
He was right there.
Shut up!
See what happened now.
Sir, I...
He knows you well.
Man, No excuses.
Sir, but...
Where will I find him now?
I couldn't find my wife who left me.
You expect me to find a dog?
Okay...
Come, let's go.
Tomy, watch your step.
Oh, no.
God!
Amalu... Amalu, stop. Let me come with you.
Come...
Come, let's go.
Amalu...
Let me check.
Go away!
Come, let's leave from here.
- Amalu. Come this side. - Yes.
Come...
I don't feel well.
Very hungry.
Wait right here.
Al faham!
Let me grab some quickly.
Shit!
It was close!
- Amalu, if Mr. - Tomy promises something...
Uff.. what's this Tomy?
Don't you know that I don't eat all these?
At home, Grandma would have made awesome curd rice for me.
Shit, how did I come out trusing you?
Oh, I forgot Amalu. Sorry.
Who is that?
I'm too old.
But we'll find a way, son.
You see that bowl?
Take it and follow me.
What?
Follow me, son.
Sir... It's safe, right?
Don't you want some food that she likes?
Wait here, Amalu.
Let me search once again.
Were you both abandoned?
She has our babies in her tummy.
Oh?
It happened by mistake.
Come with me, dude. Let's see.
Sure.
See, I'm famous over here.
These are our folks.
Boring rice and veg curry.
Amalu will surely like it.
Veg food is tasty, right?
Amalu, have this drumstick.
I'm used to this condition.
Kids, I didn't mean to upset you.
You may wash your hands now. I'll make tea for you.
Okay, sis.
Haridas is too hungry these days.
Sumathi sister, be careful.
Sis, you should be very careful.
Oh, our Kari Das.
One black tea here.
Hmm... It's getting dark, son.
Looks like nobody will turn up.
Humans care only that much for us.
I didnât know they were abandoning me, son.
After days of searching, when I reached home...
I didn't wait there anymore.
I just walked away from there.
Son, he is dangerous.
but also to protect humans when they are in trouble.
It doesn't matter who I am. Leave this sister alone.
Who are you to order me? Shove your tail and get lost.
Bruno my boy, leave him alone.
Don't create problems.
Shut up, you oldie.
Hey, stranger... You go now.
You go, sis.
Yeah, go without fear.
Kids, you follow her.
You'll get something to eat.
Yes, go with her.
What?
Go!
Go.
Leave me.
I got only this dosa.
It's barely enough for me and Hari Das to eat.
Let us all share what I have.
When I take you both there, Kari will be very upset.
Come.
It worked, Amalu.
Come, let's go.
If I dig deep... dig deep...
Nothing? I had kept it here.
What if I get a bone..? Tired of digging. No bone in sight.
Let's not do it anymore. It's hot.
How about lying down and cooling myself?
Yeah.. Yeah.. there it is.
I dug dirt without any reason.
What will madam bring today to eat?
Wish she gets porotta and chicken.
Oh, sister is here. Sister is here.
She is here! She is here!
She is here!
I'm here!
Amalu, walk slow.
Who are they? What are they doing in my home?
- Son, Kari... - Yeah?
Why are you getting worried?
They're poor souls, kid.
As if I am scary.
Listen...
On that street, a dog came to attack me.
They saved me.
When did all this happen?
That's why I told you... to take me along.
Hello...
Did they really save you? They don't look all that much.
The female dog looks pregnant.
My darling!
And your names?
I'm Tomy and this is Amalu.
Looks like you both have eloped.
Brother... That is...
Under certain circumstances...
We have a neighbour who looks like you.
Must be a crow.
Oh, Blacky is the name they call anything that is black.
Then.. Hari Das was the name of that woman's son.
Even if someone calls me Blacky, I automatically turn back.
That has become a habit.
Yuck, it's itching too much.
I was getting nicely emotional.
Then, you will obey me as long as you live here.
Sure.
Then the food... that's not sufficient even for me.
Lie down anywhere. No problem.
See the sack there?
That's my place.
You dare not come near that place.
Then every morning, a stray cat comes.
Only I have the right to chase and bite that cat.
Oh, silly cat.
Who, him? Try going near that. He is no less than a porcupine.
I'm hungry, sister... Very hungry.
What the..? What's this? Cold rice?
Chechi... What are you feeding them?
Eat it, Kari...
Oh, as if you've served me biriyani.
Greedy fools.
Don't break that bowl.
What are you staring at?
You eat...
I like rice porridge. Need a change once in a while.
Yeah, right.
Leave some of it if you can't finish.
No, this is over.
Sister loves us a lot, doesn't she?
True...
If Roy Pa had brought another dog home, I too would've created a sceneâ¦
Hope Roy Pa hasn't forgotten me.
No way.
After a few days, when we return with the kids, they will forget everything.
If they don't, you should somehow make them.
- I don't eat fish and meat. - You don't get them here either.
It's been ages since I had a bulls-eye with pepper, you know.
Those were the times!
Unnecessarily remembered bulls-eye. Go sleep quietly, dearsâ¦
- Not even a mosquito to snack on. - Good night, Kari bro.
Oh, good night.
How can one scratch like that!
Hope nobody has seen.
Anyone will get angry, right?
Go, run away! Don't come near me again...
Yeah, right.
Who are they?
Ok, good for me that you came.
Stop grinning. Not brushing your teeth?
You're really smart!
Sumathi...
Yeah?
That female dog is pregnant tooâ¦
- How's their food? - You know that, Aishaâ¦
We manage with what we haveâ¦
This morning, she was barking at the fishmongerâ¦
Can you keep one of them with you, Aishu?
It's forbidden in our religion, you knowâ¦
How cute they lookâ¦
Let them grow up hereâ¦
For what exactly? You take them. They are forbidden for you, no?
Kari, what is meant by "forbidden"?
That...
Aishumma brings it to me once in a whileâ¦
Give it to them. It's homemade.
You don't worry about their foodâ¦
See, these are good breeds which have to be fed well.
Not like our Kari...
You should see her hubby. He's darker than me.
Oh my, yummy chicken!
Sister, how's brother? I'll come with the plate.
Here...
This plate still stinks of leftover rice. Argh!
Here here... Have it.
For me?
Killed the mood...
Won't talk to any of you.
Kari...
You finished it so fast?
It was agreed when we came here, we'll only have your leftovers.
Don't make me emotional. I was just kidding!
Eat.
I'll eat after you.
âa In the blue night that blooms âa
âa Making a palette of colours âa
What's this now?
Amalu...
Yeah, beautiful!
Come on, guys. Yeah!
Âa Won't our hearts heal with time? âa
âa Let's continue our tricks on the streets âa
With Tomy's blessings... Jesus!
Hold that pose.
A li'l comedy!
What's this? Give me one more.
Look who is here.
They're from a well-off household.
Here, take it.
Kari!
Oh, no! Where is the fish?
- Run! - She saw us, man. Run!
Âa Memories of your touches pain my fingertips âa
âa Longing to feed you milk, I extend my hands âa
Âa Won't our hearts heal with time? âa
âa Let's continue our tricks on the streets âa
Look at his pose.
Is your name too Rooster?
Yeah, come... I want only a little.
Âa In the blue night that blooms âa
You have been doing this for long, not done yet?
- Wait there. - Come fast, Kari.
Run!
No no, you can't give black to all of us.
Ohâ¦ I can't wait to see them.
Then come. Let's sleep.
You need proper rest now.
A lot of night trips, these days, eh?
Good night, Kari.
Amalu...
Amalu...
Amalu!
Amalu...
Amalu...
Kari!
Kari...
Yeah
Dude!
What?
I looked around everywhere. She's missing.
Missing?
Come, let's check. Come on...
Amalu...
Amalu!
Amalu...
Tomy, come here...
Amalu...
Amalu!
Come.
Kari, come on quick!
Tomy, come.
Kari, hey...
Tomy...
Hurry up!
Tomy...
Kari...
Kari... bro...
Dad...
Bhasi is here.
Settle his remaining payment.
He wants additional 5000 rupees for good breeds.
Let's just give it to him.
Why?
Let him bring.
The same ones we turned crazy with our injections and let out.
Look at what they've given us back.
Prime slots in news channels.
The political mileage it gave...
What awaits me is next year's Padmasree award.
Three. Seems like one of them is pregnant.
Move that pregnant dog to the special room.
Where is that female dog?
But I heard about someone who had escaped from dog catchers.
Sir, it has been two months since we lost two dogs.
I too have a dog at home.
Around 50-60 dog missing cases have been reported in the last couple of months.
Thank you, sir.
We aren't able to deal with real problems. Who is going to bother about dogs?
Sir.
Or, give them a loving glance and a touch.
In return, a dog will dedicate its life for us.
What privilege does a man deserve over them?
It's clear that I won't get any justice from you.
Now let the dogs take care of themselves.
Thank you, sir.
So, Aleena. Where is she?
Yes?
From what you have told me, this doesn't seem like the ABC guys.
- Means? - No big deal.
What, bro?
The guys who took me were very caring.
Oh... She is carrying our babies.
Amalu has to be rescued, no matter how dangerous the place is.
We dogs can smell 40 times better than a human being.
I'm sure you guys will find her. Now go!
Use your power and bring her back.
Hey...
Buddies!
Looking for the hideout where they took the female dog?
Yeah. Do you have any idea?
There is no place in this territory that I have not peed on and marked.
You come. Come on...
I've been running since yesterday.
Where did he go? Bro...
Hey...
Tomy, I'd warned you, right? We needlessly followed the idiot.
Are you both tired of running?
What's that thing on top?
Who is he?
Bruno.
What's his problem now?
Let him come close.
We will scare him.
He's a bit dangerous.
Hey, you!
Kari...
Bruno, don't pick a fight. We are already in trouble.
I know. You will never be able to find her.
She is now among the thankless creatures called humans.
Bruno, we can't waste time with you. We have to go.
Kari, come.
Oh my God!
Come on, run fast!
Climb up here!
Wait for me...
Oh my God... Dude...
Tomy, shall I close the shutter?
Put the shutter.
Stop there!
- There are pits everywhere. Careful. - Ya, saw it.
Careful, Tomy!
God is there, see.
Told you...
You brought this on. Now suffer...
You die here. Let's go, Tomy.
Tomy, what are you thinking?
Tomy, listen to me.
Why are you doing this, Tomy?
If we leave him here, he'll die.
Bruno, move!
Come up, dear.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, guys.
- I'm not as cruel as you think. - Ya, of course!
Life was good till that villain came to my life.
No problem. We'll take care of him.
Good that Bhasi is there.
Even though the underground dog fight is new here, the sardars from Ludhiana...
Victor...
Ten days...
He is Black Jack. Bruno will fight him.
What a tragedy...
There are people who know how to love, like my Roy Pa and Sumathi Sis...
Don't worry.
Let's go, it's getting dark.
Need to run some more.
You are carrying, right?
Yes.
My delivery was just a month ago.
Where are your babies, then?
This moron brought only me here.
They take us to a room often...
and inject something above our haunch.
For some time after that, we can't do anything but lie down...
Such a shooting pain.
Wish we could escape from here soon.
Will someone come and save us, dear?
That way, we are lucky.
Don't you think so?
Who's that?
What's the matter, Bruno?
What's the scene?
Won't you talk?
To save Amalu...
Whatever it takes...
we will find her.
That's great!
Ha, can anyone dare to beat us now?
Yes.
Shift it to the test room.
We got Evil 420 test dose, right?
Prepare that too.
Okay, sir.
Sedate her for now, I will check again after two hours.
- Wait! - Yes, sir.
Where's dad?
He is outside.
You can go.
cannot scare me!
I will kill street dogs again.
Whatever be the consequence...
I am ready to go to any extent to face it.
Not only for animals...
Trying to intimidate me with a silly notice!
He is coming again.
Oh, no...
Dear...
What's it, Kari?
Smell of stale beef fry!
Bloody Indian street dog!
You're also on the street for long.
Forgot to pee in the middle of this search.
Badly want to pee now!
Take a leak and come back fast.
Could there be any itchy bugs here?
Amalu...
Bruno.
They took Amalu away in this van.
I know him.
He made me like this.
No matter how far he goes...
I'll stiff and find him.
Damn it!
Tomy, move!
Move... aah!
Kari!
Kari...
Tomy...
Hey, Kari.
Aah... Can't get up.
Dude, try to get up.
Kari...
Hey, Tomy...
You follow Bruno.
Go!
Dear son... Kari...
Bruno...
Bruno...
Come.
Kari...
What happened to Kari?
He's hit by a vehicle.
Come...
Let's look for Amalu first.
Come on!
Bruno...
You search around here.
I will go, check inside.
Who's this guy?
Who let him out?
Amalu...
Oh, God...
Amalu!
Yeah...
Has nobody seen him?
Are you looking for that female dog?
Yes.
They've taken her to that room, where they give injections.
How did he untie it?
Amalu...
Go, catch him!
Oh, no... sir!
Sir, save me!
Oh... oh, no!
Sir... sir, save me!
Oh, no... Don't bite me there.
Sir...
Sir...
Amalu.
Get up, let's leave.
Amalu... Amalu...
Tomy...
Tomy.
Don't stand here.
Amalu, come.
Okay... Okay.
Hang up, man. Enough!
Okay then.
Why are you staring, pup?
Oh... no!
Oh no, don't bite me!
Oh no... save me!
Anybody here? Oh, don't bite me!
Ah... stay away!
Go away, you dog...
Amalu, come fast.
Tomy...
Amalu...
Come.
Amalu...
Amalu...
Amalu...
âa A colourful dawn, once again comes this way... âa
âa Times that filled the eyes with darkness, is now afar âa
âa The shade I've been searching for all these years âa
âa Is close now, closer âa
âa This journey will continue âa
âa And the memories that come in this journey âa
âa One day, with love âa
âa To come closer to you âa
âa A colourful dawn, once again comes this way... âa
âa The shade I've been searching for all these years âa
âa Is close now, closer âa
Sir, is he William?
The new member?
Sir, too many dogs are roaming on the streets.
But to detect bombs and catch criminals...
we have to import these fellows from Germany.
You are wrong, man.
Last year, our squad rescued one of them.
Today...
He is good, sir. What's his name?
But I call him...
Kari.
Industrialist Narendradas Karanavar and son Roshan were arrested.
Dog Rescue Group announced that they will give shelter to disabled dogs.
Tomy!
Hey, Tomy! You're not even looking at me.
Hey, Rooster bro!
You haven't become curry yet?
No dear.
she left before me.
Oh, really?
Forget it.
I knew that you both would come back one day.
I'm happy now. It was so boring here without you.
Your idea worked in the end.
Hey, there is a happy news!
Finally, I also got a hen as girlfriend.
A hot chick!
You, naughty Rooster!
My pups will take care of all that.
No way, Roy will cook me if I come there.
Okay.
Where were you?
Sir, though I had to struggle a lot, we got our Tomy and Amalu back.
Sir, they were starving there on streets.
Don't worry, we will feed them well and get them back to shape.
Sir!
Amalu, come. I'll show you something.
Which Tomy and Amalu are these then?
You..!
Go and drop them wherever you picked them from.
Come dears, uncle will take care of you.
I can see now.
My sweet son, death is only a veil of smoke.
And you will find, the ones you love.
This, is where I found her.
Hi. I'm Stellan, your advisor.
I'll show you around.
And this is for the museum. It gives you access 24/7.
The Renaissance.
Actually, my research will focus on 18th century medicine.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I just wanted to show you the baby.
And I'm really sorry I don't have the time to, show you the 18th century,
Oh!
Eva! What are you doing?!
Where are you going?! Sit down! We haven't finished talking!
What are you doing?! Answer me!
Answer me! Look at me!
Dont touch me!
You took a big risk by moving here, you know.
- I'm here now. - Indeed you are.
Hey, come.
I'm, really sorry about yesterday. I was stressed, I was in a hurry.
Well, lets see.
with top marks.
Well, you have to say your, profile is quite unusual.
Can I ask you something? Why Dr. Anmuth?
Hey, I wanna show you something. Come on.
Hundreds of personal accounts from Anmuth's patients,
There is no book on the doctor/patient relationship like this.
show up in the correspondence he kept with dignitaries and other people.
This is Tina.
It's okay.
She's close. She's about to find me.
She's a few pages away from where we all come from.
18 of April 1729.
All right.
This isn't a child.
Maria...
not like other women who have nothing to eat.
Go.
Arise.
I felt my heart beating,
...than a woman with a fever.
I don't think that's possible.
My husband's a man full of ambition, a sense of duty.
An officer has to think of his Kingdome's future first,
"But for me... there is no season when love lies quiet."
Ever since then, a part of me still dwells in her rooms.
Put it down! There.
You requested to see me, Mr. Langwer?
I thank you with all my heart for coming, madam.
Well...
I have been wanting to tell you this for some time.
Valentin... what do you think?
A worthy young man who would take over of some of his cases.
But, Johan saw me through the birth of our two sons.
do not question my decision.
My baby is fine.
It's blood no longer, it's sap.
Mario, listen to me...
you give credence to everything they say about you?
They talk to me, those they call dead.
Maria, they are called dead, because they cease to live.
I don't know what they are then. But they talk to me.
Valentin?
- Who brought you here? - Maria.
Did she?
Well it's nice to see you.
Thank goodness, I thought it was me!
Gunter, wait their.
General von Ouerbach.
Unfortunately, there has been some unrest at Tecklenburg.
Some of the more senseless gossips are asserting that the
and that it was somewhat to your advantage to get rid of it.
Maria is like a daughter to me.
and I have complete faith in your integrity.
Oh well, I'm sorry to say,
I have no doubt, about my decision.
Would you mind, asking your boy, not to meddle with my instruments?
Gunter!
and His Majesty King Fredrik Vilhelm.
These rumors must be uprooted.
Superstition gnaws into the mind of the people.
Nils Lindgren, a brilliant young man from Sweden,
whom the court holds in high esteem.
There is no further need for you to visit our residence.
Everything is normal. No need to worry.
Good day, madame.
Yes I know. But this time it's not necessary.
Sir.
Please.
Done.
Maria is among them.
She speaks of the dead, as if they were seeds to plant.
Should such thoughts be given credence?
I couldn't stop reading this.
- Thanks for letting me take these letters home. - That's good.
Yeah.
Look. We're finally scanning the book. And the letters.
They shine a completely new light on Anmuth's work.
It's like studying anatomy through a poem.
You don't know what your getting yourself into.
I wasn't sure that I should come.
I understand there's a new physician who will work by your side.
A month has passed since my last menses.
- I can't. - Johan...
I must go.
How is Valentin?
Well... his heads always in the clouds.
Valentin!
Be silent witch, or I'll deal with you myself!
If you are not capable of looking after your own servant, I will.
That witch is leading Valentin astray. Do you understand?
Spending time with her is the last thing my son needs.
and you will see, that it takes form, and becomes clear.
See Valentin, is looking there, far ahead.
Learn to look through a spyglass, Heinrich von Ouerbach,
and then, you will see your son clearly.
Ever since then, a part of me still dwells in her rooms.
But I need to understand, why was Anmuth replaced by a younger doctor.
And why did Ouerbach, who was his sponsor,
It reveals the transition between ancient and modern medicine.
The young doctor In England,
who studied in Halle in Prussia,
And he didn't even believe in touching his patient's bodys.
Let's study the letters some more.
Something must be here.
Why don't we talk about it more over a drink?
Mmm hmm.
Thanks.
We finally reached our jam session moment!
Anyone?
I want to sing.
Do you know "Candy Says"?
Of course yeah. You sing, we'll follow.
"Candy Says".
* I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly *
* over my shoulder *
* What do you think I'd see *
Thank you.
Here.
Come in.
You're not the first woman to faint in my arms you know.
No flowers?
I brought something else.
Look... I know I shouldn't... give this to you.
But I just have to.
See you later.
Thank you.
Bye.
Maria.
Maria, is there something troubling you?
Why so sad?
My mother is dying.
Let me be clear, I don't believe any of this nonsense,
But I will go to your mother.
She may be irresponsible, but she is truly an unfortunate.
To hell with Lindgren.
Maria, I'm sorry, but your mother has died.
In times like these, it is more important to talk about the dead than about the living.
- Talk about the living and the dead! - Maria please calm down.
Nobody listens to me!
Tell my story, and the story of the dead.
Give us the soul that we deserve.
Maria, I forbid you to leave the house!
Well you did.
Well, this is a first.
So, Eva...
I gather you have a research scholarship at our university.
What is your chosen field?
Interesting.
Really?
I just think, Eva wanted to express her own...
You should be thinking of the future
and how to deal, with the very real problems, we are face.
Well I like to question the present, the past and the future,
I know exactly what I'm doing. But I think it's really my own business.
- Why? - You two,
You were sparkling today.
not get into arguments too early in the game.
I like to watch the back and forth.
But why would you hold back at all?
know how to deal with things... on the surface.
It's like surfing.
It's the only way I can be myself with somebody I care about.
With somebody who's worth it.
Like you.
Stop it.
Very good, Stellan.
Yeah. You have too many lucky days.
I need to tell you something.
The point is, Eva is my patient.
And she's also pregnant. Did you know that?
She has to terminate the pregnancy,
otherwise both her, and the baby, could die.
Stellan! Stellan!
I'm not conscious of my motives in writing this volume.
Yet another might be a martyr burned in fire, because his nature
is to defy and to dissolve into the flames.
When can we know that our motives are sincere?
Only when our actions are not part of our nature.
And how can we be sure that our actions are not within our nature?
Maria, why don't you speak?
I need you to talk to me, please.
I tell her to stop.
She doesn't listen.
She whispers in my ear.
She tells me of a tragedy...
of a child...
a little boy.
Valentin.
Burn it all!
Over there too!
Valentin! No!
"The deep waters of the lake swallowed his body."
Stellan!
What's wrong?
I looked for you all day yesterday. And your phone was turned off.
You've been studying this book for months.
What's going on?
You have bigger problems.
Morgan told me.
You're pregnant.
No, not if you risking your life.
My baby won't hurt me. I know that.
We'll be fine.
You're crazy.
Valentin...
My son's death described in every detail.
How could he have written something like this?
I think he's he's losing his mind sir.
He gave credence to that evil woman. He started writing down her visions.
How did you come by these?
Pay it no mind, madam. There the words of a madman.
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!
My sweet...
What's happened, mother?
Nothing's happened.
Valentin is not to leave the residence.
And you... You're old enough to look after your brother now.
Try to love him...
Don't worry, mother.
Elizabeth come here.
Elizabeth?
Servants. Servants!
Please, breathe slowly.
All those things we never said to each other, they're not lost.
I can not live... without your love.
He's a beautiful boy. Just the way you imagined him.
No, you can't go in there!
and by will of General Heinrich von Ouerbach,
No, you can't do this! No, let go of me!
No!
Please don't hurt him!
No one must see your behavior.
No no...
The soldiers will say she died of fever.
People who hate her will be glad, but no one ever truly dies.
In any case, they've taken him away by now.
The tree where you meet, is no longer there.
That's not true!
Keep your eyes open. Wide open.
So wide that you hold your breath.
Just a glimmer of understanding, as you walk down a new path.
The baby's fine.
And before we get to that point, we have to do something about your heart.
And the sooner, the better.
Robot surgery will be less traumatic for you, but...
I'm not afraid...
not any more.
That's what happened between you and me.
The things we never said to each other.
They're not lost.
Every step, every error, every secret brought me here.
This is an intolerable situation for you.
You shouldn't be alone.
And you belong to me.
What do you know about love?
Alright. I'm going back to the hospital now.
I'm gonna sit behind that machine, and do whatever I can for her.
I don't know what's gonna happen, but what I do know,
is that what I'm doing, I will do, with love.
or you can play your part and share in the kind of love
My dear Johan, I never could have imagined
Nothing will ever be the same.
I do not know how you were able to predict these events.
Where are your words now?
My lord.
Master Gunter.
Forgive me.
For you, mother.
Mr. Morgan, we're ready for you when you are.
can elevate his mind, to such a degree, as to perceive the world of the angels.
The ability to put our head in the clouds
reaching for a new vision.
And here I am.
Good luck, little boy.
who sacrificed her life while protecting Gujarat.
Non-violence is the real principle.
Don't forget that the kingdom remains united with the fear of sword
heavy to me.
Alright.
Ajaypal?
Lilukumari.
Ajaypal Singh has all the rights over Patan's throne.
Aren't son and daughter's rights same in your principle?
And the same time can also countercoup.
What's worrying you?
Sometimes even the internal factors,
come to you before it's too dark.
AJAYLPAL SOLANKI
Now, see.
This chapter is still incomplete.
the glorious King Mulraj Singh Solanki established the Solanki era.
King, I'm the same Trilochan Shresthi
Come to the point.
Trilochan.
The prince must get married immediately.
King,
if you allow me, can I suggest something?
was married to princess Minaldevi
Princess Nayika Devi,
-Praise be to Sati! -Mother Sati!
Princess!
What tradition is this?
How will the widow attain salvation
Henceforth, your name is Kalyani.
Real love happens at first sight.
Then you will forget your friend too.
And from Bhuj to Malwa no princely state can dare insult Patan.
-Insult. -That…
War is not the solution to every problem.
The queen is right.
How can a mother like me tolerate this?
I feel like going to the battlefield right away
No, Shresthi.
Not all wars are won with the fights.
Queen,
Kadumb will face the deadly outcome.
She's also very stubborn, King.
How can we be in danger when we are with Shiva?
I'm sure this was Patan's conspiracy.
Impossible.
Is it so?
Kumar Ajaypal Singh?
We've reached Patan, Princess.
Daughter-in-law Nayika Devi pays respect to…
Modesty and manners.
Insult?
The greatest warrior named Mulraj Singh Solanki
This Patan is my pride, Devi.
a part of our court of ministers…
Queen Nayika Devi,
-May Solanki rule… -Always triumph!
Kingdom of Kashi,
How are you, Sahastrakala?
You have to guide Ghori towards Patan.
And if she fails,
Forgive me for my mistake, His Highness.
Gulfan has always served Ghoris his whole life.
That Gulfam has to serve
Never.
Have mercy on me.
Sultan!
Sultan, you grabbed my palace.
I've nothing left to give you, Sultan.
I've nothing to give you. Spare my son.
No, Sultan. No.
No, Sultan.
Butcher.
No…
Have mercy on me, Sultan…
She's a little sharp.
Bring her to me.
Sure, His Highness.
Where were you going, girl?
Greetings, Trilochan Shresthi.
Welcome, Malva's king Vijjaldev.
How can I avoid your order Trilochan Shresthi?
Order?
You have to order me.
It's suffocating to live like this.
After Pratapmal's coronation ceremony,
Lion looked at Ghori.
Ghori looked at the lion.
Lion jumped towards Ghori.
Listen to this, His Highness.
The moment tiger took a leap towards Ghori,
Thank you.
They are just…
buttering you up.
Forget about defeating it,
it was impossible to enter
Win over Patan.
I was very young,
One day Queen Bhopalde's convoy was passing from the city.
I was so happy watching all that.
The moment…
I wish to be a queen one day.
For the first time in my life I felt insulted.
For such a small thing,
I will rule Patan one day.
Ghori will win Patan.
you give it's charge to your slave and move ahead.
To make you my slave,
Time hasn't passed.
At the same Shiva temple.
Don't you think,
Friend!
Make sure that the subjects should know
Before Patan loses its self-confidence
Queen!
King Ajayapal Singh always ignored your behavior and your conspiracies.
Leave for King Kumarpal's ashram right now.
he doesn't need any enemy for his own destruction.
Greetings.
No.
But I met the commander-in-chief.
Will you not?
Queen mother. She's Sahastrakala.
Alright.
That you belong to Ghori.
Does Patan treat it's guest like this?
Guest?
I don't need them anymore.
Give it back.
-King, return it to me. -Kalyani.
This is a dancing horse.
Riding this horse, when a king goes to fight,
And the king…
Shahabuddin Ghori has already left from Multan.
I had come to Patan to create conflicts in your administration.
I wanted…
Should I laugh on your foolishness or have mercy?
Queen Mother.
And it will always be.
May Goddess protect Patan.
Sahastrakal has been killed.
His words will sharpen our swords.
Listen to him.
we will meet.
Before the war…
It is against Ghori's nature.
Wear these bangles that I've sent.
Because a woman manages the house.
My dagger is enough to win Patan.
Enough.
but every woman of this world.
I will not step on the Land of Patan,
They will take four to six days to encamp from there.
Ghori's camp is in Arbuda.
And the war is already prohibited…
Ghori will create havoc in Patan.
together will also be less.
because we always waited for them to attack first.
Before they unsheathe their swords, we would have made our first attack.
That I live in the salty region.
One day a man saw his death before him.
Death told him.
He stopped at an isolated and deserted place.
But when he opened his eyes.
Even death said…
whereas you were destined to die here.
Almighty has decided this place for Nayika Devi's death.
And gave me the responsibility
that anybody would shiver with the sight of it.
I will bury Solanki's in Arbuda.
Shamsher.
And I will face her directly on the battle field.
I want Nayika Devi alive.
Such pride?!
Queen Mother,
is heading through the valley.
If Gazanavi and Solanki had a war,
It's our chance to erase the stigma on the Solanki dynasty's administration.
Hey, children of Patan's.
Because Ghori has come here for his ambition.
Whereas we've come here to protect our motherland.
Hail Lord Shiva!
Attack!
Attack!
Hail Lord Shiva!
Hail Lord Shiva!
Nor a woman's honor.
End my life.
I pardon you life.
That neither you will live…

I know I'm working a lot lately.
You're a big cheese. He doesn't even have a job.

Outside? Yeah, son.
You gonna talk about your plan? You moving forward?
Are we, are we-we done exercising?
Now we are. Step off that thing. Get off that thing.

I guess.
I don't know. Why not?
I'm just saying, son, there's more to life
Sow your royal oats?

Yeah? Where do you usually meet girls?
I, actually, just got out of prison.
For what? Jay-walking?
No, I, I hacked the Department of Defense.
Seriously?
I'm not even technically supposed to be online right now.
That's why I was so surprised that you messaged me.
What can I say? I'm a girl who knows what she wants.
Hello!
Back door open.
...- What's that about?
My, my mom has this crazy security system.
Well, it's not that bad.
You're smoking that now.
Now you are, too..
Smoked weed or kissed a girl?
Neither.
Seriously?
...No, no, no, no!
What's the problem? - System armed.
Come on, guys. We talked about this.
Go to...
...in my office.
The files will be...
at the corner.
Shawn? Hey!
Wow.
What's wrong? - Huh?
Nothing. I'm fine. - We were having fun.
It was five minutes. - Five minutes?
Yeah, I-I forgot. Right. Right, right.
Everybody gets five minutes, even me.
For Billy's college, if he ever goes.
Every time there's a situation, you always throw it in my face.
Okay, I get it, you're a big deal.
Is this some sort of man thing? - Maybe it is. Maybe it is.
I mean, yeah, why not, why-why should it be
any different from any other times?
Yeah.
Were you gonna check it?
Billy tripped the alarm again.
Can you call the hotline and tell them to cancel it?
Hey, Angela, um, I hope you're enjoying your date...
Hi, this is, Shawn Davidson on 1623 Ridgeview Drive...
Yes, again.
When you get a chance, can you stop by and check on Billy?
Nakatomi Tower. - That'll be great.
Goodnight. -
Done. - Love you.
Well, everything okay?
Yeah. Um, Billy still has that girl over.
Okay, well, maybe we should stop watching
Is she drinking our tequila?
I don't even like tequila.
It's still our tequila.
What about our weekend?
What? - I... No, no. I'll get the car.
Let me get the car.
Shawn.
Sh-Shawn? - What?
Look!
Shit!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, we-we gotta call the police.
No, no, no. - No, babe!
911. What's your emergency?
Hi, there's some men, in my house.
My God. My God. My God!
Everything's fine. Thank you.
My God!
I don't, I don't know, babe.
My God!
Okay, they're on the move.
Let's go! - Okay, spread out.
Give me your hand. Just... Come here.
Sit down!
Okay, so now what?
We shouldn't have called the police.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - What if I can't see Billy?
What if we can't... - No, girl.
Okay? All right. - Yeah.
It's gonna work out somehow. We'll figure something out.
Excuse me? Are you the Davidsons?
Are you in on this? - No, no, no, no.
This is Josh. I'm at Pershing and Vanderbilt.
Sorry. Listen.
All I know is I'm supposed to deliver a message to you.
That-that's it. - What's the message?
He-he said that this was part of a scavenger hunt.
I'm not saying nothing else to him.
M-ma'am, I-I'm part of the neighborhood watch crew.
I mean, I don't know what the walkie-talkie's gonna do.
No, no, no. Just take it. I'll tell them I lost it, okay?
Do-do you need me to call someone for you?
Yeah. -
What are you doing?
It's more than likely just a simple RF transmitter.
So if I can just switch this...
Okay. - Okay, James Bond.
Lift up your arms.
Babe, I-I really don't think
Well, they managed to break into our house
I'm not taking any chances.
Or maybe...
it's just not that advanced.
What? - I'm just saying, babe.
Do you?
I don't know. I...
Are you involved in anything?
Is it?
Wow! - I'm just asking a question.
Is that too far off base? - Babe!
Hey.
There. You have one hour.
Hey, who the hell are you? - All-all right!
What are you doing? - Checking for booby traps. An...
Need a registration check on Massechuttes, reg,
four, whiskey, echo, Nancy, 4-9.
Like, babe, it's one small key, so it's gotta be a lockbox.
Damn!
How I get?
Good evening, officer. - Hi.
You tell me. - I'm sorry?
You out for a stroll?
Folks like you walking around in a place like this.
Folks like us? What does that mean?
Nah, he's just talking about... - I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sure the officer can tell me exactly what he means.
Can I see some ID? - For what?
Babe, you gotta chill out. All right? You need to calm down.
You need to stop laying down.
Okay? We gotta think about Billy.
It's the last thing we need is this dude.
Thank you, folks. Stay out of trouble.
Yeah. - No more joyriding.
...What does that mean?
His conviction.
Sorry. It's just a joke.
Y'all have a good night. - Yeah, you, too. Thanks.
Have fun destroying the Fourth Amendment.
Really?
This sucks. Come on. - Get anything, babe?
Everything these guys have is crap. Goddammit.
So, so are you guys just thieves?
Is that what this is? You-you-you, you're robbing us?
I wouldn't get too close to this one.
Yeah. Hey...
What did he mean about your conviction?
What? - The officer.
When he said, "No more joyriding."
Why would you lie about that?
And, and I just, I panicked, I guess.
So this whole time? - My bad, I'm sorry.
It, it's fine. I'm just, you know, surprised.
It's fine.
Okay.
Baby, well, why don't you stand back, just in case?
Right? - Yeah.
God.
Hey, check this out. It's one of ours.
Someone gotta be in there to see 'em. Is anyone in here?
Hello? Hello? - Hello? Is anybody here?
We need help, please. - Hey, hey! Sir, sir!
We're closed. Open at 7 a.m..
This is an emergency. - Then call the police.
We can't. We need to see the footage on your cameras.
Yeah. - What, are you crazy?
I know it's weird, but it's really important.
but Citadel prides itself on your privacy.
It's extremely important. Please.
Tomorrow morning. Goodnight.
...Whoa! No.
Nah, man. Okay, we-we're going. Come on, babe.
Shit! - Shit.
Dammit! - Shit.
Why would anyone want us to kill Larry?
We have to at least look like
I'm not killing Larry.
God. It's Angela. My God. Thank God that you called.
Hello? I need better reception. - Hey, honey, I heard your m...
Hello? Yes. - Angela? Angela. Okay.
Just listen. There are men at our house, and they have Billy.
Ange! - Shh! Angela!
Hello? - Shit.
We gotta keep this moving. - Pick up the phone, baby.
Please.
She's not answering.
The fact that we're depending on Angela
to help us is scary, babe.
She just now got a dolphin tattoo on her ankle!
Come on! - Yeah. Wait.
Someone's opening up the side door.
No, no, no, no! I told them not to go in there!
Damn it!
You never said anything about hurting anybody.
Patrolman face the music.
Screw you! -
Everyone's on the same side here.
What's your problem, girl?
...We need a knife.
...Yeah!
She's not really with these guys.
Yeah.
Hey, help! Over here! - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hurry up! What are you doing? Come on!
Hey! Let's go now!
Get her on! - Okay, okay, okay. All right!
...Move it! Let's go!
Baby, no! - Stay strong, son.
Ba... No!
Fuck. -
No! No, no, no, no.
Fuck. God!
That girl. That girl got shot. Right?
Who are these people? - I don't, I don't know.
I never should have called her. It's my fault.
No, baby. Don't you dare say that.
Okay? It's not your fault.
Wait, babe.
H-how did they know we were stopped?
H-how-how did he know we were stopped?
Hey, hey, babe, babe, get your security detector thing.
Anything? - No! No.
Damn. - N-nothing.
No! - When did they put this here?
How long have they been planning this?
Obviously, long enough to stay two steps ahead of us.
Hello. - What?
I see.
This, too.
Keep the change.
Here.
Are you okay? - Yeah. Look.
Is-is that...
What are you doing?
Okay. All right.
Come on, babe. You got this.
I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think about you!
I have a masters from MIT, a bachelors from Yale,
You know, if women had dicks, we'd look like Popeye, too!
I am a strong, capable woman.
I'm about to be CEO of a company.
You, my dear, are an ex-con who can't even get a job!
Don't get me started on our sex life 'cause,
honey, it's just non-existent.
Get out the car! - No! What the hell, man?
Hey-hey-hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on! Come on!
Why do you want us to kill Larry Tench?
Is that gun even real?
Mad at me one more time, and I swear to God,
I will fill you with hot lead.
Who has our son? Who?
...Bruh.
I'm just a actor! - Wait, what? You're an actor?
They said you were in on it! - Who? Who said we were in on it?
I don't know! They booked me through my website!
Trickjames.com! I'm a, I'm a white Rick James impersonator.
I do parties and shit, man! I'm just like, you know...
No offense.
♪ The-they never let you down ♪
What the hell was that? - I-I don't know.
Ain't nothing to see here.
Come on, come on. We gotta go.
Huh? - That stuff you were saying.
I was just talking. - You was just talking?
Get in the car.
All right. Come get him.
My God!.
My God!
Step one.
Cologne.
Yeah. That's Larry. - This?
Like-like, that's what this is about maybe.
What? Are you crazy? I work here. What's wrong with you?
Hey, I-I-I did not mean any of that.
those thoughts rattle around.
After 18 years of marriage, stuff builds up.
I'm sure there are things about me you don't like.
Tell you what? - What don't you like about me?
It's not a game. Tell me what you feel.
I'm-I'm not going to get upset. I promise.
You know, they got caveman paintings
Okay, I just feel that there's some secrets
that just aren't meant to be shared.
Are you having an affair?
You've been distant, angry.
you don't tell me where.
I don't know.
Don't know what?
I don't know if I can trust you.
Like, when, when have I ever lied to you?
Yeah. - Coding class.
Why wouldn't you tell me that? - See, that's...
That's why I didn't wanna tell you. You think it's funny.
Who?
Well, apparently, nobody is hiring a convicted felon.
Not even for contracting.
What do you mean by "Finish this?"
and figure out what is going on!
What makes you think that Larry knows anything?
We're not killing Larry.
Yeah. Yeah, well...
You've been here. - No, honey, I haven't.
Hey, get off me. I wanna find out what's going on.
I'm just gonna talk to him. - We talked...
No, don't grab me with the gun.
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
That was an accident! - Was it?
Larry, do you know anybody who wants you dead?
I just want a glass of damn water!
Okay. Step two.
Constant physical contact.
Everything okay?
No, actually. How does this thing even turn on?
It can be frustrating.
You see?
Magic touch.
What are you doing? - Just...
Just trying to get to know the real you.
Are you seriously trying to seduce me right now?
No.
Is this what you want?
The real me?
My God!
Amateur.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Hey, have a drink, man.
I'm good.
Well, then put the gun away, 'cause you're making me nervous.
I, I'm making you nervous?
Larry, do you have any idea
What you've been through? You came here to kill me!
Because, Larry, all of this
Larry... - Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Can I talk to Larry by myself, please?
What? - I just need a minute. Please.
Yeah, okay. - Thank you.
Well, he wasn't that hostile at the Christmas party.
You, you want one?
Thank you.
You have no idea why someone would do this?
Do we really know which one of us they're mad at?
I feel awful because I thought
Shawn was involved with someone or something.
So he lied about being in jail? Okay.
If we can't call the cops, then,
So...
Not bad, Mrs. Davidson, not bad.
Okay.
Okay. Hey.
Some good news. Your friend and her date, they're still alive.
My God! That's great news.
Hey, do you recognize anyone?
Nah, they're all wearing those masks.
Hey.
Maybe they slipped up somewhere.
Gonna take a while to load that.
Kat. Okay. Okay.
Martinez, come here.
What happened? - I was right about Kat.
She's-she's not really with these guys.
She's actually really great.
Dude, she knocked on us. - Okay.
But she didn't have a choice.
They have footage of her dad stealing a car on camera, stupid
thing to do, she knows it, but he's sorry now, so it's...
My hands aren't clean. Are yours?
I'm in the Chamber of Commerce. - Whatever, man.
Listen, they sent the footage to the state police
So all we have to do is hack the state police
You want to hack the state police?
Hold myself back so he doesn't feel uncomfortable?
Hell, no. You're an eagle. You fly as high as you want to.
which isn't the case at all.
laying next to him has been the only time
He makes me feel safe.
You let work come between you.
No. How long?
Long enough that I should have figured it out.
That's on me. - Is it over?
Larry, I'm so, so sorry.
Look, my-my point with that is that work is not everything.
Well, maybe I don't wanna become CEO.
...All right.
All right.
Okay.
How come? What are you guys looking at?
See if we can recognize a face. - Yeah, no luck so far.
How are you accessing that video?
Um, yeah, he's right. How are we able to see this?
It-it, it's just a new feature.
So having our personal, security footage
No, anyone can't see it.
Well... Yeah.
that the only people able to see them are the homeowners!
You two, shut up! Damn!
Babe! The gun. Remember?
AAA Postal, in mid-city.
My God! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Please pull that up.
Okay.
I could kiss that old bastard.
Wait a minute. - What?
Let me... Wait a minute. - If you know something, Larry...
Wait a minute. Would you just be quiet, please?
Shit.
What?
No.
Okay, can-can somebody fill me in?
He deserves to know.
Four years ago we launched Citadel Ultimate Protection,
Full package, the works.
You guys got an office in Moosup?
A, a subcontractor? That means...
It was my call.
I thought I could walk him through it.
What happened? - It's just...
The worst-case scenario.
He left on a business trip and
his wife stayed with the two-year-old.
It was just a malfunction, the, alarm went off
so she was trapped inside with these, two criminals
and no help coming.
They shot at her four times.
Judge had to haul him out of the room.
Ultimately, we weren't found liable, the subcontractor was.
What happened to them?
Chapter 11. He vanished into the night.
So-so they, they got nothing.
No justice? - No.
You kill me, he kills your son.
It's two birds with one stone.
J-Janet, I-I-I know this dude.
You know him?
That guy is in my coding class.
He, like, talks my ear off every night.
You were talking about our family with a total stranger?
Babe, I ain't giving the guy PIN numbers.
Shawn, you didn't. - Don't blame him.
It's my fault. We gotta call the police.
No, no, no. They still have Billy.
You really think they're gonna let him go, even if you kill me?
I, I don't know. - It's either this.
Or you let him shoot me. And I may be having a rough month.
But I ain't ready to go there just yet.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, babe, babe, babe, look at, look at this.
Look at this.
Did you lock the doors?
But it can't be good. - Shut up!
Stand up! Hands behind you.
We know you're in there.
I said, everyone out! Hands up!
I'm not screwing around. I mean it.
I don't understand what you're trying to say to me, Larry.
Back stairwell. Other side of the office.
No, no. I'll do the distracting.
Maybe we should just talk to him.
Gonna count to ten!
They don't wanna talk.
One, two...
We just can't sit here.
I'm not screwing around! Eight!
We're coming out! -
Mr. Tench, you remember me?
I do.
Okay, then. - No, stop!
Babe! - No, please.
I know I don't have to.
I want to. - No, you don't!
Believe me, you don't.
Truly, it did.
that I failed you so terribly, it...
That violence, anger, revenge, it will just consume you.
It's not gonna bring back anyone.
Larry!
Come on! Go, go, go!
Larry, please, stay with me.
...Damn!
Larry, please, Larry.
Larry, get up.
You gonna point the gun at my wife?
Shawn, look out now!
Hey! Look! -
Get him off me. Let's go!
Get him up! - Shawn.
I've got everything in the world that matters to you.
Okay.
...Get down there!
Dad! - Son!
Hey, it's okay. - Give me a hand with this.
I'm shot. Jesus.
You...
Both of you, you okay?
Yeah. - Like, who are these guys?
Long story. - Everybody shut up!
We're not going anywhere.
Hell, we can go back there tonight
and clean out the whole place.
I hired you for a job. We're gonna finish it.
Okay. -
Hey. Call your wife. - What?
Dad! - It's okay.
It's okay, son.
Hey, in ten minutes I'm gonna execute your family
I hope you're watching.
Isn't that a rookie mistake?
Kat!
What's up with this light?
Doesn't work. Been meaning to fix that.
Three minutes. Got it. Okay.
You was inside, huh?
What? - That's a jailhouse tat.
I did 15 months in Cheshire.
We ain't gotta talk, man.
The worst 15 months of my life. Can still taste the food.
What did I say to you? - I'm just saying.
be able to trace that? Not to mention this asshole...
Shut the hell up now! - Dad, seriously, stop.
What's goin' on? - Someone's messing with us.
Dad!
Son!
Damn, no more bullets.
Okay. It's all right..
Now you two go and hide.
Please. All right? Be careful.
Go, go, go!
Stay away from me.
Please?
Hey!!
You punch like a girl. Hey!
You're gonna have to type for me.
python 2 dot 7.

What happened? - They got away.
Three minutes. Here we go.
We gotta get out of here!
No, it's her! She's screwing with us!
This place is gonna be crawling with firemen and cops! Come on!
Screw you, man! -
Hey, what's going on?
You guys good in there?
Shawn, he's coming! Move!
Hey! -
Ooh!
Stop this! Please!
Billy. -
Now you want mercy?
Leave him alone, you psycho!
Hey! -
File dot 4 dot 6 dot 1.
Delete. Execute.
You sure?
Like smoke in the wind.
Billy, get out of the house!
Come on.
Hurry, Billy!
Kat, come on.
Hey!!.
...No, no! Son!
Billy! Janet, I can't get to him.
A life for a life.
Hey! -
Mom! - Billy!
My God! My God!...
Are you okay?
My God.
I'm so worried about you.
Dad! - Okay.

18 YEARS AGO
and remained in the possession of master cartographer Mercator until 1594,
And for this lot, we start at 30,000 euros,
The atlas!
Captain,
Is that the atlas?
Come on!
Are you okay, Captain? - Eyes on the road,
Hold on!
ZEPPOS THE MERCATOR TRAIL
PRESENT DAY
Hey, Benji, - Good morning,
Hi, Benji,
Thanks, - Bye,
And why did my mum refuse it?
It killed her,
I know, - And now you're eighteen,,,
so you are authorised to sign,
Right,,,
What did you expect, Benji?
Just some old junk,
No junk,
Beautiful authentic book,
Shit,
Sorry,
Come on,
Thanks,
And erm,,, what class you got now?
Severijns,
Oh, Fancy that, Me too,
Yes, I'm a free student,
So you're free to go, aren't you?
Slien?
Look at it this way, You're free too now,
Yes, free to go to the library,
The library? - Yes, I need to work on my paper,
Hold on, Are you writing a paper about old books?
No, this is one of my sources,
You can do research online, Wikipedia has sources, too,
At an outdoor café, My shout, - No, Benji,
Anyone can grab that photo off the internet, - Whatever,
Shit, Er,,, Sorry, don't mind the mess, I'm still settling in,
Is he famous then?
Famous? He's the man who mapped the whole world,
Do you want it? I have no use for it,
Awesome dude,
I didn't know about that, - No worries,
Don't get any crazy ideas, Kurrel,
Leaving already? Can I offer you a drink? I've got,,,
Milk,
Good for the bones,
Maybe some other time,
All right,
<i>No, it will need a completely new lock,</i>
<i>Can you get here asap, please?</i>
Thank you,
Hello,
Right,
Did you call for a locksmith? - Wow, you're fast,
Yes,
I wish, I was burgled,
Yes,,, They turned the place inside out,
Did anything get stolen?
I mean,,, Anything of value?
They are of v,,,
Sorry, - Sure,
Yo,
<i>This is the locksmith, You called earlier about an emergency?</i>
<i>Mr Kurrel? Can we meet you in half an hour?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
I hear that nowadays burglars have an interest,,,
books,
Who are you and what do you want?
Young man, what you are holding there rather awkwardly, is a kirpan,
So by no means sharp,
Don't,
I said,,,
don't,
Sharp after all,
I'm calling the police, - Let me introduce myself,
Did they take it? - I lent it to someone,
To whom?
Slien,
Come on,
Pick up,
Slien!
Slien!
Slien!
Kurrel? - Oh, thank God,
What are you doing here?
I was reading,
Do they know I have it?
What was that?
They do now,
Sorry,
What the fuck,
This way, - My monowheel,
Leave it, - Oh, shit,
Sorry,
Benji,
Fuck,
Excuse us,
Faster,
Oh no,
Faster,
Faster, faster,
This way,
Jump in,
No way, Come,
Who was that? - No, no, no,
There's no door, - In the back,
Slien, - Benji, who is he?
Who is he?
Come on, Push it up, Turn it, - How does this thing work?
Look,,,
Not only did Mercator create that atlas, He kept it his whole life,
Mercator left small comments in some of his books,
Annotations, Crumb trails, - A crumb trail to what?
May I?
No, The Golden Fleece,
This is from a Greek myth, right?
Geez, How long have you been working on this? - He mentions a solar eclipse,
That's insignificant, He talks about the Golden Fleece,
Excuse me,
Alchemy? No way, - What?
If this Mercator was able to make gold, then why can't we do that anymore today?
Because the emperor wanted to keep it secret,
so Charles VI had to silence him, he,,,
He even sent the Inquisition after him, - The what?
The Inquisition? A kind of Catholic faith police,
Thank you, - They sound like fun,
The Inquisition even locked Mercator up, but he didn't keep quiet,
That's why Mercator hid small clues about the Fleece in his work,
In his maps, - His books,
Yes,
The Golden Fleece is still hidden somewhere,
Mercator's crumb trail can lead us to it,
That's why I would like to search that atlas for clues,
Right, But now I do,
It's Captain, - Captain?
Yes,
But only if Slien and I can come,
Right,
Get in,
Wow,
Slien,,, - Isn't it lovely?
Slien, - What?
An old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, What if he's a serial killer?
Hey, Guys!
Your Majesty,
Welcome to the Molenhoeve,
Sorry,
So,,, We are supposed to find something in here,
Sugar, miss? - No, thank you,
<i>Emergency services, which service do you require?</i>
Slien, - From Celine?
Celine?
Yes, Like Dion,
Wait,
<i>In menses sine sole,,,</i>
<i>In menses, is that with an e or i at the end?</i>
No, - No,
Rupel-what?
Whoa, whoa, Hold on,
Let me introduce you, This is Luna, This is Ilios,
No way,
No problem, Excuse me,
Oldtimer,
Just like me,
Definitely no way,
My name is actually Stephorst, Jan Stephorst,
Those who have dared to ask, didn't live to tell the tale,
That's what we say, anyway,
There's no 5G down there,
What is 5G?
Come, Come,
Captain? - What?
In this cell,
Is it working?
Yes,
Over here, - What?
G,M,
Come on, Benji, Faster, faster, faster,
I can feel something,
What beefcake? - That's not important now,
Too late,
The other way, - Is that possible?
Come on,
Faster,
I can see light, guys,
Oh,,, Such a beefcake,
Did you lose something?
This is all we've found,
Captain!
Yes, - I'm okay, I'm okay,
Because of him, - We haven't lost anything,
<i>Vlassenbrouck,</i>
Here, - Hey,
But,,, What if those two come after us again?
A good map can tell you everything,
A satnav is much easier,
No entry road, Ben, - The name is Ben-ja-min,
<i>In 100 metres, turn left,,,</i>
<i>Turn left, - That was a driveway,</i>
No,
If we don't sink,
I knew we had to turn left,
Benji,
Sorry,
Something inconspicuous,
Something inconspicuous? - Yes,
And?
Nothing,
Are your specs telling you that? - Yes, they are,
It was only rebuilt in 1603, That's ten years after Mercator's death,
We won't find anything, - Ben?
Benjamin, - Yes,
You still got that photo? - Of course I do,
There, Careful, eh, - Sure,
Perhaps there was something on the reverse,
No, no, there was nothing on there, I checked, I did,
So,,,
not enough,
Stop going on about the solar eclipse, - Yes, and Wikipedia,
Okay, then let's call it quits, That Mercator trail is leading nowhere,
Then why are we being followed?
Can I have that?
May I have this dance?
Celine,
Sorry,
I've found him,
without the atlas,
He wasn't alone by the way,
This is Celine Sleyp and Benjamin Kurrel, - Kurrel,,,
So they're on to something,
<i>Exsurge domine</i>
Touché,
Arise, oh Lord, and judge your own case?
Touché, - Benji,
Touché, - Oh, Benji,,,
Guys,,,
I didn't even warm up,
Hey!
Take it outside,
Happy now?
Touché,
It's a different metal, - I believe that belongs to me,
So it still exists,
But in the end, I always win,
Never mind,
Oh, will you?
Are you going to pull out the thumbscrews again, perhaps?
We have moved with the times, Mr Stephorst,
The days of the Inquisition are long gone,
You can't dictate what people have to think anymore,
People think for themselves now,
People live in the illusion that they think for themselves,
And who determines what they see on there?
It shouldn't remain a secret,
Are you going to hand out gold nuggets then?
I have a cramp,
I don't think so, - Cramp's gone,
No, No,
No,
Yes,
No, - Shit, Slien, the boat,
Hey,
Choke, - What?
Pull the choke, - Pull the choke,
This here? - Yes,
On the PlayStation, - Benji,
Sorry,
Captain!
Oh my God,
Calm down,
You're flooding it, - Then don't use it as a boat,
What?
Get out,
My father?
I apologise, Mr Stephorst, I assumed he knew,
Knew what?
What did he say about my father? Did you know my father?
Yes, But I don't know about his disappearance,
You didn't tell me? What happened to him?
Smoke!
Problems, - Oh, shit,
Hey! Help!
Benji, stay calm, - Yes, perfect time to stay calm,
Come on,
Help!
Move over,
There,
Slien?
Slien, Are you okay?
Captain!
Captain! - Zeppos!
Captain!
Zeppos!
Captain!
But it will all be okay,
Did they shoot at him and try to burn him alive, too?
We searched for the Golden Fleece together, but,,,
And you just let him leave,
What should I have done? - Stopped him,
Because I want to know what happened to your father,
Whatever,
Benjamin?
Hey,
He's a bastard,
that he wasn't coming back,
But my mum kept saying to me:
So I sat there and,,, and I saw the coffin and I thought,,,
Can he breathe in there? And,,,
I had constant nightmares
Sorry,
It's okay,
That's just some old junk,
KURREL AND ZEPPOS TAKE ART BACK TO CONGO
KURREL AND ZEPPOS THE BIG INTERVIEW
He left you his story,
But,,, it doesn't tell us what really happened,
There is someone else who knew your father,
Rest assured,
Good,
It is vitally important
And if they do, they need to be destroyed,
Why? - Because our organisation has sworn
to protect the secret of the Fleece, Barral,
And we've kept that secret so well that nobody knows where it is, Even we don't,
<i>Exsurge domine,</i>
<i>Exsurge domine,</i>
I will destroy the atlas,
Monica, We are not doing that,
A secret is but a secret if it's kept,
Understood,
Back in business, - Oh, nice, That was quick,
It's over here, Do you want to do it?
You're right, I don't,
Ethical hacker, Only to do good, - Yeah, right,
Ready? - Yes,
Excuse me, - Keep walking,
Is he talking to us? - Yes, Just keep walking,
Excuse me,
Excuse me, - Yes?
I'm looking for Mr Boswell's office,
You're welcome,
Let's follow her, - And then what?
Come,
Benji,
Sorry,
Look, the code is always stored in the keypad itself,
Like that,
Okay,
1987, The founding year of Barral Technologies,
Is this one of Mercator's maps?
Yes, that's his map of Flanders,
Ready?
<i>Stephorst, - Captain, I've found it,</i>
<i>Found what? - The Fleece, The Golden Fleece,</i>
<i>You can come, The boat leaves at half six,</i>
<i>No, Ben, no, - We can help so many people with the gold,</i>
<i>I'll call you when I get back, - Hello? Ben? Ben?</i>
Okay,
This way, - No, no, no, This way,
Could that be the beefcake's?
Sure,
What do you want?
My father,
Do I take after him?
Too much, actually,
But sometimes not enough,
Tada,
And?
And?
What is your plan, Ben?
,,,jamin,
we should look for The Virgin Mary in Vlassenbroek,
This,,, is Vlassenbroek in satellite images,
He drew Vlassenbroek on the wrong bank on purpose,
We couldn't continue the search without our walking Wikipedia, could we?
You could've given up,
Look, they can set fire to that Fleece for all I care,
I just want to know what happened to my dad,
Me too, son,
Me too,
Well, Captain,,,
But can it float?
It can fly, though,
Really?
<i>F, A, Familiis Verdonc, Bastiaens and De Kremer,</i>
What does that mean?
That the Verdonc, Bastiaens and De Kremer families paid for this chapel,
That's Mercator's original name,
Sounds hollow,
Wait,
No, don't,,, - Are you crazy?
Beautiful,
An astrolabe,
Celine, look, There's a very small inscription,
<i>Atlas Europae, - That's our atlas,</i>
A flood? - No, no, no,
An island, Among the waves,
Why did he do that? - So he could tell who copied him,
Yes,
It must be in his atlas,
Shit,
Too fast, - Wait,
They've got the key, - What?
My God, - Okay, I can fix it,
Did you steal this car? - Can we discuss that later?
Come, Get out of there,
I think we've lost them,
Here, the island is real, - We're kind of in the middle of something,
To your right,
Slien!
Benji,
Slien,
There, See that?
Like that?
The island exists? - Then why is it not in any maps?
And my dad,
It should be around here somewhere,
Do you see anything yet?
No,
Nothing,
Guys,
Well, I'll be damned,,,
Flanders,
Careful,
Right,,,
Hey, he said he'd wait for us, - Call him, Call him,
Benji, - Benjamin?
Benjamin!
Wait,
Hey,,,
And I've picked some bad berries,
Not a good idea,
and weakened,
Here,,,
But that he'll live like a proper Kurrel,
I've become too weak to descend down that damn tunnel,
Benji?
Benji?
Benji,
I think I've found something,
Come on,
Maybe we need to press something,
<i>Like in Indiana Jones? - Could be,</i>
<i>I wouldn't stay there for a second, near that cursed island,</i>
<i>It's not on any map, but I saw it with my own eyes,</i>
And you're sure Stephorst was on board?
Yes, But the skipper dropped them at the island,
I should have gone with him,
This,
Basically the first pocket computer,
It really was, It can measure the altitude of stars
or tell you what time it is, Look, You keep it as steady as possible,
Vega,,,
Of course, you'd need a different plate for every location in the world,
I think,,, that plate was made for this location,
Perhaps there was another clue in Mercator's letter,
Guys,
It's a ram,
Oh, right,
Is that the secret formula? - Perhaps, yes,
Are these the same symbols as on the Fleece?
Pew,
It's cobalt, - Cobalt?
Yes,
What? - Cobalt,
He needs it to make his computers and phones,
You're good at this, Kurrel,
Wow,
Wait,
Shit,,,
We were going to make that formula public, You'd be free to use it,
The Fleece had to remain secret,
No!
Slien, get out,
Benji,
Benji!
Benji,
Benji, Benji,
Captain?
Okay, Benji?
Come, Benji,
Your fencing's got a bit rusty, it seems, Eh?
Benji!
Zeppos,
Come, Come with me,
Show me, - Yes,
You'll be okay,
You know what they say about ill weeds, right?
What about you?
If I ever write a paper on this, no one will believe me,
Good one, - Your father gave me that name,
So after a few bottles of wine, your father changed it to,,, Zeppos,
And it suits you,'
I wasn't fond of it, But he,,, he was shaking with laughter,
But I'm proud of that name now,
And of you,
No, no,
About our adventures,
We still need to get off this island,
I know, but how did Barral get here? - In a boat, probably,
Then where is it? - No way,
Are we going to travel on water?
How does it work? - Press a few buttons,
Is the handbrake off?
Whoa, - What is that?
That's The Cat's mask,
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M…
Who tried to murder you?
Mrs. Carter?
Mrs. Carter?
Can you open your right eye for me, Katherine?
Mrs. Carter?
You've sustained serious head trauma.
but I… need some indication that you can understand me.
Right eye worries me.
Is she even aware?
My name's Nicky Mackenzie.
I haven't killed anyone yet.
I'm just gonna move your head.
but can you try and move your left eye for me?
I won't give up if you don't.
Not until you can blink or move your eye
from the left to the right.
I'm waiting. I'll let you know.
Lina Carter.
You don't remember me, do you?
They said something about, um…
locked-in syndrome.
a loss of limb function and speech
So usually,
if she was conscious, she'd be able to communicate
but in her case,
So…
Well…
It means
she's either in and out of consciousness,
or she can't control her eye,
she's in a vegetative state.
Will she recover?
If she's in there…
I'll find her.
Tell me about her.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I've known Katherine all my life.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And when Mom died, she became my legal guardian.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And Rowling Manor became my home.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Back then, Katherine was rich, glamorous and famous.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I loved everything about her.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But everything had been turned upside down.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">When Katherine's husband died,</i></font>
Hold on.
Katherine, help!
Put it under his head. Here.
Should we call Dr. Lawrence?
If it lasts more than five minutes, we'll call an ambulance.
He's not breathing.
He's breathing.
You look so beautiful.
Where are you going?
Call me if you need me, but, uh, don't call.
We'll be fine. Jamie's feeling better today,
and he's never seen your show. I'm gonna make him watch season one.
He milks them, my stepson, the seizures.
Then he brings them on
Maybe he just misses his dad.
It's hard when someone you love dies.
I should know.
You're a good girl, Lina.
Your mom was lucky to have you.
- Ready for my big comeback? - Definitely.
Ugh. Mutton dressed as lamb.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Mommy?</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What's wrong?</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm scared.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Oh. You're a very brave girl,</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and we're gonna get through this together, okay?</i></font>
I heard what happened.
To your mom.
You're safe here.
With me.
You'll protect me, will you?
Promise?
I promise.
What was she like?
She was brilliant.
Well, sort of.
She taught me the basics, anyway. I can teach you if you like.
I don't remember my real mom.
I remember my dad.
Sometimes his face gets a bit fuzzy though.
Like I'm starting to forget him too.
Katherine got rid of the photos.
Anyway, we've got each other now.
to say to yourself, "She's still the same underneath."
Is that right? A hit-and-run?
They're not sure.
Um,
Katherine's your adopted mother,
but she's also your mother-in-law.
It's complicated.
I couldn't abandon him.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">By the time we were married,</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Jamie depended on me for absolutely everything.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He needed me. And to be honest, I needed him too.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'd looked after him for so long, he'd become my whole life.</i></font>
She's had too many.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I was Jamie's reason for living.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But Katherine thought I was a treacherous gold digger.</i></font>
Lina.
My beloved daughter-in-law.
Which I did not see coming.
Who'd have thought that when you turned up here…
…a helpless waif and stray,
completely dependent on my kindness, that…
that you'd end up…
To Jamie and Lina.
To Jamie and Lina.
- Showing off. - She's not.
She was nice to you before we got engaged. Suddenly, starts treating you like shit.
- What does that tell you, hmm? - Jamie.
This house, that's all she cares about.
Exactly. Anyone would think it's all about her.
Please!
Clear the floor.
- Stand back. Give him some space. - Somebody help.
- Excuse me. - I presume she knows.
we've got to get you off of these pain meds.
I keep telling him.
She's bad enough. She watches me like a bloody hawk.
I take them as prescribed.
Mostly.
I'm in pain.
- Neither of you know what it's like. - We understand, Jamie.
Yeah, yeah, fine.
Just gonna go in between your fingers.
- Here. - Me?
Mm-hmm. Come on.
Do you wanna get her shoulder?
Just take that down.
Up round the neck.
It's an unlucky lot, your lot.
First Jamie, now…
I used to look after him.
What's Jamie got to do with anything?
You tell me, love.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Jamie was always ill.</i></font>
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Then…</i></font> - Lina!
Coming!
<i><font color="#80FFFF">…lots of things.</i></font>
No, my fault.
Oh!
All right.
- What's that? - Nothing.
You've got to get off these pain meds.
Don't start.
I'm soaking wet now.
It'll cool the inflammation.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
We should get married again.
Dr. Lawrence had to carry you up the stairs.
Don't ever leave me.
Say that you won't.
It's not safe out there, Lina, beyond these walls.
You of all people know that.
On the streets.
Good morning. How's his nibs?
The pills are making him worse.
I've got some steroids we can try.
If they reduce the pain,
then we can wean him off the Oxy, gradually.
waiting on him hand and foot.
You're ten years too late.
Win the lottery, did you?
The car, yes.
You off for a swim?
If I can make it without the bloody bell ringing.
I jump in before I can get second thoughts.
Timing.
- That's awful. - It's absolutely terrible.
There's a whole world out there.
You can't hide out here forever.
Can't I?
How's our patient today?
Yes, uh, Dr. Robert Lawrence.
Oh.
- Well, I'm his GP. - Oh!
I'm also a close family friend.
Oh, okay.
You're not the one who prescribed him the painkillers, are you?
I'm Nurse Mackenzie. I'm neuroclinical.
I mean, I deal with anyone who comes in here with neurological problems,
including grand mal seizures.
between his pain meds and his seizure medication.
And you'll know that 80 milligrams of codeine is hardly a responsible dosage
to give to someone who appears
I think we should give the family some peace and quiet.
All right.
Be right back.
I don't appreciate people casting professional aspersions on me.
No, I was just--
to make judgments about the patient's reliance on pain medication.
I'm his GP. You're a nurse.
Show some respect.
Mr. Carter
is under my care now.
Come in.
Lina.
Excuse me. Not at all. Please come in.
I think he did it to punish me.
to fix someone that doesn't wanna be fixed…
…or admitting that…
It's none of my business.
But when was the last time you had any fun?
Can't remember.
Somewhere hot.
Drink till you fall over.
Dance a lot.
Preferably the samba or the rumba.
Or possibly the mumba.
The mumba?
Doctor's orders.
Fuck!
You all right?
No, thanks.
Don't be silly.
I'm okay. It's just a cut. Looks worse than it is.
Sorry?
When I took you in, you had nothing.
which isn't even mine anymore.
I sunk everything I had into Rowling and for what, hmm?
because I took over and looked after Jamie.
I'm not his wife.
His nurse, his carer.
Different words for the same thing.
Servant.
This is your home.
It'll always be your home.
How dare you offer me the crumbs from my own fucking table!
I don't have to take this anymore.
Then leave.
- Missed it. - I'm just embarrassing myself now.
What was that?
I told you I was crap at tennis.
Crap is putting it mildly. Jesus.
- Now you're just showing off. - Nice. Nice.
Get it! Get it!
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
- Whiskey. - Scotch?
- Evening. - Um…
- I'll have a Shiraz. - Coming up.
Is… everything okay?
I shouldn't have come.
Lina. Lina.
Yes.
I know.
It's just I'm so out of practice.
It's only family. No need to impress us.
Why don't we pick you out a nice dress?
Oh, Katherine, what happened?
What really happened?
What's gonna happen, I'm gonna read out the letters, out loud,
E-S-A-R-I-N
T-U-L-O…
M-D-P-C-F-B…
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Happy birthday, dear Katherine ♪</i></font>
Thank you.
Only a small piece for me. I don't eat cake.
- Since when? - She's gutted now.
- I'm not gutted, Jamie. - Liar.
It looks delicious, Lina.
We learned that tune together, your mom and I.
I vowed that if I ever got rich,
You bought the piano?
Hmm.
safer than the foster home.
I got out of poverty. She didn't.
I became a Hollywood star.
I didn't let it affect our friendship, but, uh…
Why would she do that?
She broke my heart.
Sadly, not the last.
You abandoned her.
If she told you that, she lied.
My mom wasn't a jealous person.
Sorry to disappoint you, Lina,
but I was the one who maintained our relationship, for your sake.
I was the one who flew you out to California on school holidays,
who insisted I become your legal guardian!
I don't have to listen to this.
She hasn't spent the last ten years crawling around trying to please us
because she actually loves us.
She's here for herself. She's using us.
What use are you to me?
This is my house now. Mine and Jamie's.
Should someone go after her?
It's Katherine.
Ever since she got here, all she ever wanted was your love.
I worked my ass off to become a doctor just to please my father.
For fuck's sake.
Just getting a glass of water.
Where were you today when I… when I rang the bell?
I know about everything that goes on in this house.
You don't respect me.
I have no life outside of Rowling.
Locked in a body that doesn't fucking work?
You use sickness.
- Don't. - She went to bed alone that night.
but, no, you abandoned her.
Stop it.
That's what happens when you leave people, Lina.
Wait.
Does he know about us?
I don't care anymore.
I do.
You would lose everything, including your home.
I only want you.
Lina.
Why can't we just leave? You and me?
I am this family's GP. That means I'm sleeping with a patient.
They would ruin me.
They've stolen my life from me.
If you want me…
if you want us…
I'll do anything.
I feel like Spider-Man.
Well, Robert helped me, but it was my idea.
That was his suggestion. He's quite the ladies' man, our Robert.
The island?
Yeah. Robert's gonna row us out there, aren't you?
He thinks I'm scared.
You're not strong enough to swim, Jamie. You've never even learned.
It's about to start raining.
Look, I'm sorry about what I said.
Get in the boat.
Come on, Lina. It's only a little boat ride.
This is exciting, no?
There's a nice spot.
See that? That sandy bit. We're going past it.
Whoa, what are you doing? You're missing the bloody island.
- Help! - Jamie!
Jamie!
Jamie! Jamie!
No, no, no!
Well, you must have known he couldn't swim.
Whose idea was the boat trip?
Really?
Hmm? It wasn't Dr. Lawrence's?
How long have you been seeing Dr. Lawrence?
The boat capsized.
I tried to save him, but he… he kept flailing around, dragging me down.
And then, um…
It tipped!
No one dragged me into anything.
Shh!
He comes at night.
- Something to help you sleep. -
We can never be happy here, Robert.
Forget about Katherine.
For us.
If you sell Rowling, we'll never have to worry about money again.
Is… Is that what this is all about?
- Money? - No, it's about freedom.
Yours, as well as mine.
Where did you get that?
It's all in here, Lina.
Page after page of murderous fantasy.
You even talk about drowning him.
You're no better than me,
so you let me do your dirty work.
You seduced me.
Then you took your husband, who can't swim,
Because I thought you loved me.
Katherine!
Lina, what's wrong?
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
I said move.
You bitch.
Lina!
Lina. Lina, please, I can explain.
I loved you!
Lina, let me explain!
You're the one I love. Not her!
Lina, wait. Stop.
Oh, fuck.
Lina.
I just wanna talk to you.
Lina!
- Lina! - Get away from me!
Let me in. Don't do this, Lina.
Open the fucking door!
Lina, come out, and we can talk about this.
Come on, then.
I think I know, but you need to tell me I'm right.
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M--
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U--
E-S-A-R--
Did someone try to murder you?
They're using the alphabet board.
She'll fuck us both.
Calm down.
I know that.
I tried to stop her.
Bullshit.
And then what?
She has a lot of medication in her bloodstream,
She was thrown from her horse. She sustained serious head injuries.
I discharged her. You brought her home.
They won't believe us.
Doesn't matter what they think, as long as they can't prove it.
There's nothing fucking here.
<i><font color="#80FFFF">She blames herself for everything. She tried to save your life, Lina.</i></font>
We've still got the diary.
There's nothing she can do to hurt us.
Let her go. This was all a mistake.
You love her, Robert.
If you hurt Lina,
I'll tell everyone the truth.
Did you try and stop him?
You tried to save my life?
I'm here.
Waiting for you.
Go on, then.
You stupid…
In a far-off place,
amidst vengeance and enmity...
flourished an inseparable friendship.
Hey, Deva! Forget it.
Hey, Deva!
I thought you were bringing a huge army...
But you've brought only this guy.
Just because you are born to my father
You have to earn it.
Do you see that wrestler?
He is my champion wrestler.
He has never been brought down.
Any challenger here?
Absolutely no pressure.
You can get lost...
Step-brother.
Rudra, you are making a mistake.
But I thought you knew me.
But, you don't know about him.
Before he does something to you, give back my nose ring.
If there is anyone, come forward.
Oh, really!
Tell me!
Come on!
What is he even capable of?
Get lost!
Hey, Deva!
Deva!
Deva!
Deva...
Stop!
Deva...
Deva?
Deva!
Deva, get up! Deva!
Deva!
Deva!
Let's help him.
Don't touch me!
Give it back!
Let's go!
In a far-off place...
If you lose a battle...
You lose everything.
I killed her husband.
- His wife belongs to me. - No one touches her until I do.
Hey, listen! She is mine.
But I killed her husband with my own hands, didn't I? She is mine.
Hey...
I won't spare anyone.
Go away from here!
Sir, don't stand in our way.
It should happen.
Leave them right now, and in return...
I will give you one of my territories.
Varadha, think again.
I will give you Bharghat.
Bharghat is mine!
Bharghat is mine! Bharghat...
...that is the biggest territory.
Bharghat is mine!
Get lost now!
Hey, let's go.
Yeah! Bharghat belongs to me.
Deva...
I am here for you.
Don't worry.
You shouldn't stay here anymore.
You must leave immediately.
In a far-off place...
Even an unbreakable bond of friendship...
had to be broken.
Hey, make it quick.
Promise me...
Promise me.
Deva! Deva!
be a shark.
For you, my friend...
whenever you call me...
I don't know if you remember...
I used to tell you a story...
He would bring whatever the Sultan wished for...
and destroy whatever the Sultan rejected.
That man was called...
I remember, Baba.
Salaar!
My Salaar!
The sun himself holding an umbrella
He guards you like an eyelid That is inseparable from the eye
Even before you think of calling him, He leaps into action for you
One is a sword
When they walk together It's a great war
This is a friendship Of love and loyalty
May it flourish a hundred years
{\an8}Okay.
She left without my knowledge.
There is no "what if".
They would've known by now.
Radha Rama...
doesn't mean she is harmless.
ELECTION CAMPAIGN
Speak.
We have finally found one...
Hey!
Krishnakanth had created eight fake passports for himself and his daughter.
she's landing at the Lal Bahadur Shastry International Airport, Babatpur.
Apart from this, Obulamma has two notorious henchmen.
{\an8}Vedha...
{\an8}Krishnakanth's daughter has come to India, sir.
Krishnakanth's daughter?
{\an8}Hazare...
{\an8}Tell me, Obulamma.
Krishnakanth's daughter has come to India...
I want her at any cost!
Leave for Babatpur immediately.
Okay, sir.
For what you did to them seven years ago,
Please do something, Bilal.
Only you know his whereabouts.
But...
You remember the promise, Bilal?
Brother, show us the goods.
Get out! All of you, out!
Out!
Whatever you instruct me to do...
I will follow.
{\an8}Three vehicles at the airport parking.
{\an8}Done.
Hey... hey... who are you?
Hey! No, no, no... No!
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Who are you?
Hey, hey!
What the hell is happening?
Why are they attacking me?
Speak.
Do as he says.
Don't call me under any circumstances.
No... Dad...
Listen to me, Dad.
No, no... no...
No... we need to call the cops!
We need to call the cops, please.
You have no idea what is happening here.
and we don't even have time for that.
In this situation...
There's only one person in India
who can protect you.
Mother!
Come what may...
Good evening, Teacher.
This is Diya from Vijayawada. She speaks Telugu.
A distant relative of our bank manager, Mr Ajay Kumar.
She wants to teach English to the kids in our school.
That post is vacant.
Uh... only if you agree.
Uh... English literature.
Her AADHAAR Card...
Voter ID...
Class X, intermediate and degree certificates...
I have verified them all, Teacher. You can check them too.
Where did you work before this?
Siddhartha Convent.
Are you going to teach the kids?
Or her?
Where did you work before this?
Siddhartha Convent.
Why did you quit from there?
Actually...
That's what I...
Mr Sarpanch, I don't think she is up to the task.
She can leave. We will find someone else.
is not that place...
but it's the people who live there.
I have roamed several places and finally come here.
Like how you are apprehensive of trusting an outsider...
I am very apprehensive as well.
Let us both take a chance.
If it doesn't work out...
I will leave.
You will stay next door.
You and the way you teach should be liked by the children, not me.
You get three days' time.
Hey, get up!
Leave!
Don't tell lies.
Who is telling lies?
Children are like molten iron...
Mold them well,
they become lamps that spread light.
If you don't,
they become blood-shedding...
Get freshened up and come.
I did as you instructed.
She has agreed. Please let me go.
Hey, Sarpanch!
{\an8}She hasn't been eating since yesterday, madam.
trembling for vengeance.
Krishnakanth couldn't be traced.
But his daughter has come down.
Even to exact your revenge,
Our time has come.
Before searching for that girl
It won't happen again.
- Whose murder should I mention, sir? - Please, sir!
Do your job.
Bus stations, railway stations, ports, airports, highways, borders...
Their men will be everywhere.
They will certainly find a way here.
Found it on a CCTV footage.
They left that van at a warehouse and took a black SUV.
Obulamma has already instructed Hazare to find that girl.
Why are we also searching for her?
For the past seven years... We are searching for him!
We searched every nook and corner of the country.
We have access to every single CCTV camera in the country.
But not a single CCTV could capture him.
There is a relation!
Wherever she is...
he is bound to be there.
Check where that vehicle is.
Hello!
Is anyone out there?
Ma'am.
Someone locked the door from outside.
Take this teacher to her classroom and tell her the syllabus.
Hitler has left.
Take the syllabus.
Take the children. Teach the class.
And take care.
Okay, y'all just stand--
Sorry, sorry...
Come on.
Class is over!
When the children have no interest, why are you forcing them?
Understand?
Most of those who live here work in the coal mine.
I must tell you about another interesting person.
But it was your mistake.
No problem, Uncle.
Sorry, brother.
Though he looks tall and imposing,
he doesn't even retaliate when someone behaves rudely with him.
But when he is with kids...
he becomes one of them.
What is this suspense?
Hey, like a batsman sent to bowl, they gave me all sorts of assembling work.
Had they asked me to disassemble something...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Sixer!
Salute!
If you repeat this one more time...
Excuse me.
Bilal said I can leave today.
Just one more day.
Stop! Enough!
Stop it... Just stop it!
Nobody can teach any of you.
Very bad. It's impossible to teach you.
So bad!
- Good morning, Teacher. - Good morning, Teacher.
Please, sit down.
Your teacher is tired today.
She cannot teach today.
Only one run, man.
Look there.
Hey...
You are playing cricket without me?
Hey, let's go. Got the ball!
You asked me to tell you if she goes out.
Hello, hello! Madam!
You are my property.
Hey, you got me a nice property, man.
Leave the girl alone.
Look, look, look.
Oh, it hurts!
Oh, it hurts!
It hurts really bad!
{\an8}The vehicle was last seen at the Navada toll in Bihar, sir.
Where could it have gone?
Send her picture to all our men.
{\an8}What is taking Hazare so long?
{\an8}Is he not capable of nabbing one helpless girl?
Madam, it's Nayak!
{\an8}Obulamma...
Don't call me again.
Whatever comes up...
That's it?
Only these many? They didn't even bring weapons with them.
That one man is enough.
Hey, Nayak!
It's a hundred million dollar consignment.
But if you deliver this properly, you will get many more big deals.
Nepal!
Fine.
He doesn't even look interested.
Hey.
Don't worry.
Sir, sir!
Open it!
Hey, close the door!
Close the door!
Hey, let them go.
Open it!
What is it?
Nothing, sir.
We were tipped off a month ago, sir.
The seal?
Who stopped it?
The seal?
I will inform everybody immediately.
Send information to all the check posts.
Yes, sir.
That some tribes rule that place.
and that they have the largest army with the most advanced weapons.
But isn't that an urban legend?
I told you.
There is nobody in India
who can stop that seal.
{\an8}Cutout...
Sorry, Pari. I forgot about it. Happy birthday.
Okay, fine. Come. Let's cut the cake.
You must come...
No, you should cut the cake.
Take this knife and cut it.
- Please cut the cake. - Hey!
Hey! Move out, quick!
Hey!
That thing...
That too a plastic knife.
Vijay...
Yes, Teacher?
Yes, Teacher.
Sing it.
He has made violence A habit and forgotten kindness
He slayed the monster, Fighting resolutely
Be determined Dare the most powerful
Like letters on stone
Your flaws shall be erased
Like lines on sand
Chandram, Chandram!
He has to take Deva's lunchbox to the coal mine.
This girl?
Sir, she is in my city.
Tinsukia?
There is a coal mine on the outskirts.
Are there any CCTVs in that town?
Then...
Come on, guys.
Who are you sending?
I'm sending Selfie.
Sir.
Keep sending photographs from Tinsukia.
Okay, sir.
Let's go.
Oh damn!, this girl is good for nothing.
Actually, I was...
I know.
Smile!
Come. Let's go.
Hey!
Hey...
Help!
Is this the guy who brought her here?
She is absolutely good for nothing...
She took one box and forgot the other.
She never does anything right. Where is she?
Hey, hey! Who are you guys?
I'm talking to you...
Go, save the girl.
Can't any of you save her?
Oh, no! Please, can no one save her?
You? What about you?
You?
Please, someone stop them!
There is only one person who can stop them.
And that's you.
Is no one capable?
Oh, damn!
We have left him behind.
What can the poor guy do?
Deva!
They must stop.
Either plead with them.
Or make them bleed.
Like he said, just one strike!
Does that hurt?
Okay.
I don't care about that.
Village after village, town after town, city after city...
We have been moving for the past seven years.
I thought we have finally found some peace here.
But now we have to get going again!
Tell me, speak up.
Take that girl and go away, Bilal.
I came to India for this.
But my dad would never allow her.
And my mother's last wish...
Was to bring her remains to India.
Can you do this one last thing for me? Please...
The children didn't like you, nor did I.
Obulamma.
That girl...
{\an8}They are our men.
Deliver it there.
You should bring that girl from there.
Don't forget the seal.
East seems to be lucky for us.
Drive towards that direction.
Let's go there.
Hey!
Once you cross the border...
It's okay, Deva. I will take care.
Deva.
Let's get going.
Krishnakanth!
I am here.
Hey!
I am anyway going to kill you.
She can leave. We will find someone else.
Give me!
The children didn't like you, nor did I.
If they take us to Burma, we can't escape.
Answer some of my questions first.
Why did his mother react so much, over a plastic knife?
Why doesn't he cross the boundaries set by his mother?
And what is this?
Hold on to the pole.
What?
Obulamma.
Hold on to the pole tightly.
He has stopped the truck.
Someone stopped the truck?
Who the heck is he?
The person who stopped the vehicle is...
Devaratha...
No one can do anything to him.
Give it.
You can stop a river with a dam but...
How can you stop a mighty ocean?
I never told you about this, Obulamma.
He should have been killed the moment he was found, right?
But no one can do anything to him...
and made sure that Devaratha stops that truck.
The people who want to kill you...
Your father...
Him, his mother...
Me...
Khansaar.
You know whose seal that is!
For the first time ever...
Varadha...
Varadha Rajamannaar!
No one other than him can stop it.
Deva...
But, what changed the fate of Khansaar was
when two best friends...
And only one will survive.
No one can stop that seal.
The Salaar to Varadha Rajamannaar.
Salaar Devaratha Raisaar!
What happens now?
It's the rule he defined.
No one can break it!
Up... Up...
I am here for you.
Some stories are frightening to watch.
Some stories are frightening to listen to.
But this story is...
frightening to even think of.
This story began a thousand years ago.
They would not just loot a village...
{\an8}Khansaar!
{\an8}There were three tribes among those dacoits.
{\an8}The Mannaar tribe.
{\an8}The Shouryaanga tribe.
The three tribes flourished and prospered unchallenged for hundreds of years.
They turned the forest into a formidable fortress.
Fire!
The British who could reign over the entire world
could occupy the whole of India but...
In Khansaar...
After Independence, the newly formed nation had a huge issue...
Erasing Khansaar from the Indian map...
Money generated through all the illegal activities in India
petroleum, fake currency
and were operated by their agents.
To prevent the law and order from interfering with their activity,
they began to dictate politics.
Fear
With this weapon they had created
People feared to even say the name "Khansaar".
They turned this business which was run with fear
Fully aware of the violent nature of the tribes, Shivmannaar...
Drafting a set of rules to be strictly adhered to by everyone,
And according to that Constitution...
he divided Khansaar into 101 parts
He crafted a bracelet as a symbol representing a leader.
Eight leaders with at least three votes each as "Lords".
One Day, Shivmannaar died...
the leader of the Shouryaanga tribe, Dhaara had to rule Khansaar.
But, Rajamannaar never wanted to give away his father's throne to anyone else.
Not a single soul from the Shouryaanga tribe should be spared.
Can we confront them?
There is only one way to kill them all.
Men, women, kith and kin...
they must be killed while they are asleep, spare no one.
the Shouryaangas' vengeance is unimaginable.
Why?
That day, the entire Shouryaanga tribe was completely eliminated.
He built the biggest walls around Khansaar,
assembled the largest armies,
and made Khansaar the most powerful place ever.
Vaali.
Gurung.
Cheeka.
Ranga.
And Naarang.
Om, Rajamannaar's first wife's elder brother.
Bhaarava, Rajamannaar's son-in-law.
Rudra, Rajamannaar's son by his first wife.
Radha Rama.
Rajamannaar's daughter by his first wife.
Rajamannaar's honor and pride.
had been suppressing their nature for 25 years
until, that day...
Father, is it true?
Temples are built to propagate religion.
Kingdoms are ruled to propagate legacy.
Khansaar is built to propagate only one thing...
Fear.
I have maintained it until now.
No one should cross that line of fear.
Who has crossed that line now?
Okay, Father.
My King.
I know that nobody will disobey your decisions.
When will you forgive him?
Varadha.
Answer me, why?
He threw away the honor I gave him.
He lost his right to be my son.
But, he was just a ten-year-old.
Why are you concerned about it?
He also deserves the honor which Rudra gets.
For the first time, I am making a decision for myself.
All I want is one of your chairs.
Hence, I am asking you...
Ranga!
Varadha...
he couldn't become a Lord since then.
Though he is designated as a Governor,
he always lived with the confidence of a Lord.
You shouldn't ask me, my King.
You should only command me.
Yes, my King!
Your father picked up the bracelet he threw on the ground
How can I give away my chair?
Give it up.
Ranga?
cannot be defied.
There is another order more powerful than Rajamannaar's orders.
Khansaar Constitution.
And in that book, there is a very important rule.
The strongest shall...
Rule."
Tomorrow it could be my turn...
I will defeat you. And you defeat me.
Let us fight.
The strongest shall prevail.
Rule.
Is Rudra off to kill Varadha?
Rudra has sent for Pandit.
Pandit?
When Rajamannaar returns...
But by the time Rajamannaar returns,
The strongest shall prevail.
Ranga...
But I want the Mannaar tribe pride he is wearing...
The Constitution!
Rudra, it's the Constitution!
No one should disobey it.
Who stopped me?
Hey!
In his presence or absence...
no one should raise their voice or run their mouth.
Because I am representing the King now, and that's why all of you are still alive.
If the decision was mine,
Bali!
Madam!
between the Lords and the Governors of Khansaar...
I am imposing a ceasefire.
a ceasefire is imposed in Khansaar from today!
The Constitution.
All stand equal before the Khansaar Constitution.
I, Rudra Rajamannaar,
As per the Khansaar Constitution,
after nine days, the decision of whether the ceasefire
should be imposed or not will be taken
{\an8}No one wanted to wait until the voting day.
Rudra has called for Pandit...
Naarang has assembled the Russians.
Gurung has assembled the Serbians.
You tell me.
How many are we bringing?
Tell me.
Brother, tell me please.
Where is our army?
We also set out to bring an army.
In just one jeep and with only one vacant seat...
Hey, Deva!
Deva...
Your voice might have changed.
But the way you call me hasn't.
Varadha Rajamannaar.
Cook something for me.
Hey...
Would you...
Who took it?
Mother!
- I think Varadha needs me... - But...
Go with him...
Please, let go of her.
Only one.
Isn't there anyone else, sir?
I didn't call anyone else.
Surabhi!
Devaratha.
Take his prints?
I am praying to our Goddess to save us.
Surabhi, no matter how much we pray, no Gods step foot on this sinful land.
Be careful, sir.
Never come out.
What are you doing now?
Huge walls are built out of fear.
Not out of fear of those going out...
You said Gods won't come for us.
So, I am praying in the opposite way.
Only one?
You brought only one man?
We needed a whole army, and you brought just one?
Did you make all the arrangements for Deva's stay here?
Yes, I did.
Have you forgotten?
Our lives are so miserable even today.
Inform Satthi that the curry is not spicy enough.
Deva won't like it.
Everyone in Khansaar desperately
wants to hack us to pieces...
You didn't have to take such a desperate decision now.
and fulfill my wish of seeing you as a Lord.
Until now, I have been fulfilling your wishes without you asking for it...
Just fulfill this one wish of mine...
Lord!
Rudra Mannaar has sent you a message.
Lord Rudra sent a message?
Please call Deva as well...
Hey... Come.
Go, get him.
Go!
Lord!
Why are you walking, my Lord?
I also know we are surrounded only by enemies all over...
Hey...
What is it?
More than the fear of getting killed,
In Khansaar, nothing can be calculated by using a calculator.
That's why I brought a maniac who can't be calculated.
Hold the gun tight.
Safety...
That's it, right?
Let's go.
Mother...
Ganga...
Rudra on one hand and Ranga on the other.
Do one thing.
It's my mistake...
I didn't notice...
How long can he hold himself back...
Hey, leave me...
Khansaar's King, Rajamannaar's son...
Varadha Rajamannaar!
I have absolutely no value here.
Deva! Please sit down... please...
Let's go.
Hey... come here, my dearest brother...
Brother! Let me go, brother.
Baachi!
Not that something will happen to me.
You must make sure nothing happens to him.
Hey...
You must...
Deva!
You have six hands and yet...
We are in deep anguish
And you are nowhere to be seen
Why do you harbor anger
Against the fragile
To hail you with raised arms
There is no strength left
Even with ceaseless worship, We remain untouched by mercy
We called you again and again
Yet hope has faded away
{\an8}Along with Rudra, Ranga and Bhaarava, another ten Governors have teamed up.
They will also try to influence the others to take their side...
Good.
But, my Lord...
You cannot win without the Ghaniyaars.
And, none of the Ghaniyaars will go against their leader, Naarang.
Naarang!
What if Ranga tries to influence some of the Ghaniyaars to take his side?
Even if one of the leaders from my tribe goes against our King,
- Children, Naarang. - What?
Children.
Boy.
Girl.
Girl...
Hey, Pandit!
We can't touch him now...
Girl...
I also have a wish.
A wish of a Father, unlike our King Rajamannaar's.
This bloody...
Hey, tell him.
Hey, Deva shouldn't come there.
Vishnu has a procedure.
First, he flies the kite high.
Then he cuts the string himself.
the kite lands on...
He takes one girl from that house.
Oh, God! No!
First get inside! Go inside!
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah... we got our chick.
You are too young. Just keep quiet.
I am going. That's it.
No one is stopping me. Swear on me.
Oh, no!
It doesn't matter who goes, I'm a dead woman either way.
O Goddess! Save us, please... please!
Surabhi!
I cannot bear the suspense...
Hey, who called him here?
Hey!
Follow the procedure.
Stand with your hands folded.
Good.
Sir! Please spare her!
Sir! Please spare her!
Sir, sir...
She is just a kid.
Where did you all go today, leaving me behind?
I beg you, my Lord.
Vishnu chooses a hen every day
and kills it.
Please don't destroy her life.
Leave her alone.
Just give us two minutes, dear Lord.
O Goddess Kateramma!
From the herd, select a nice and healthy ram with strong twisted horns.
Hey, stop it!
Dear Lord!
Then, sharpen the sword against a rock.
Water should be sprinkled on its face.
Mutthu!
As soon as it shakes its head...
Hey!
Kill him!
Hack him to death!
Surabhi!
Goddess Kateramma didn't come.
Instead...
Brother, he will kill Vishnu.
Varadha! Stop him right now!
He won't stop.
Until that guy stops breathing...
He won't stop.
Baba!
Tell him to stop, Baba.
How dare you!
Kill that scoundrel
Just two minutes...
Vishnu has been killed.
Was it him?
Why did Deva react so violently for someone he didn't even know?
I understand!
he sees his mother.
How dare he touch the girl!
A kid at that!
Sorry.
Whatever he did that day
affected not only us...
This shouldn't be happening.
Especially during the ceasefire.
It was the new guy.
Rudra!
Since it was the new guy who flouted the rules,
you must convince Naarang to punish the culprit.
If Varadha dies, I will be happy.
But I must follow my dad, the King's command.
Uncle, I will speak to Naarang.
Please go to Varadha immediately.
Rudra...
I haven't asked you for anything since childhood.
Do something, please.
I want Varadha.
Tomorrow at Velamgadi...
Naarang is going to pronounce the verdict.
don't open your mouth.
My Lord...
Varadha didn't kill your son.
Remember that!
My Lord...
My Lord...
If we want to lift the ceasefire,
Naarang has to go against Rajamannaar
and kill Varadha.
But...
when your son was mercilessly being hacked to death...
The verdict at Velamgadi today
{\an8}Don't move until further orders.
Until I say, no weapons should be used.
Somebody's head will roll today.
As soon as it is done, come and inform me.
I will take care of everything there.
But you must remain silent.
Understand?
This is the guy who knocked off Vishnu.
I believe he killed as many as 25.
Will it be his head or Varadha's today?
He is going towards Varadha, bro!
Hey!
He is going to kill your rooster.
Deva...
Deva!
Do whatever you want with me. Don't touch Varadha, sir.
I did it.
Don't touch Varadha, sir.
Deva!
Deva! Listen to me.
Stop right there.
Sir...
I killed Vishnu with these hands.
Hey...
Kill me.
Please don't touch Varadha, sir.
Hey, get back.
Sir...
He didn't do anything...
It's all because of me...
Kill me.
I told you...
I told you not to touch him!
What are you looking at?
Load your guns!
No one touches him.
Please!
I...
Kindly...
Request!
Is it Varadha's head?
Or the new guy?
You muted me in Khansaar.
Maybe he doesn't know the rules...
Of course it was.
Varadha said it correctly...
Seriously, he got himself a maniac.
Before Devaratha was brought here, we were on a frying pan...
getting our lives fried and burnt every day.
He killed the son...
and threw us into the fire.
But no.
What he will do next is...
suspense.
What?
Brother... brother... brother...
What was that?
I forgot! I forgot! I forgot!
Can you remind me?
Tell me!
Hey!
Hey, brother! Hey, brother! Tell me!
I warned him not to touch you.
He paid no heed.
You heard me, right?
How could he touch you!
Sorry.
I should be saying sorry.
It was all my fault.
No matter what happens here,
I didn't want to involve you and restrained myself several times.
But I couldn't anymore.
You would have done great anywhere but here.
Sorry.
What could be more important to dad than this?
He doesn't answer my calls at all.
There are 101 votes in total.
Since Naarang and Vishnu are dead,
they will invalidate their four votes.
We cannot trust the remaining voters.
Zorani, Acharya, Mishra, Akram Pasha, Shukla...
I will bring them.
But you must hand over Varadha to me after the voting.
Including the King...
Forty eight.
Forty eight.
We have tried all combinations.
We also subjected them to intense torture.
The color red triggers them.
Hey, get up!
We need Varadha's vote also.
I have despised you ever since.
But for this obstacle,
Everything will go as I expected.
If you vote to lift the ceasefire...
A man goes to any extent for something he loves.
But for something he hates... he goes even beyond that.
I hated you even before my younger brother did.
I will definitely divert all my hatred towards the one you love the most.
Badri!
Madam!
If things don't go as I say tomorrow,
drag his brother out and behead him once the voting is over.
If you have even an ounce of Rajamannaar's blood in you,
you will make the right decision.
Bhaarava, I am very scared.
Do you think voting will go as we expect?
It has to.
And it will!
Finally, it's our time.
Following the discussion on ceasefire nine days ago,
and finally the King shall use their voting right.
Those who want the ceasefire to end
{\an8}shall place their bracelets with tickets on the left side.
{\an8}Those who want the ceasefire to continue
The voting shall begin now.
The voting should end within the given time.
Governor 1!
Governor 10.
Governor 6! Governor 13!
Governor 17!
Governor 33!
Governor 21!
No information on the King yet.
His flight arrival is not scheduled at Khansaar.
Now the Lords will cast their votes.
and the verdict on ceasefire will be announced.
Shivmannaar's son!
Khansaar's King, Rajamannaar returns!
Since it's a tie with 48 votes on each side,
the verdict shall be based on Varadha Rajamannaar's vote.
Make your disgrace complete now.
Others' voting is not in our hands.
It doesn't matter what they think.
Isn't it enough?
Khansaar must turn red!
Either with blazing fire...
or with their blood.
Thank you.
With your advice,
I too have...
the Mannaar blood flowing through my veins.
Tonight at 12:01 am,
Now the rooster is yours.
They lifted the ceasefire?
Against them?
I mean how?
But the most important problem was to survive the night.
Get everyone out.
Begin with his younger brother.
Sharpen the swords.
Come.
People only talk about hunting tigers.
More than tigers, I like to watch how wild dogs hunt.
Do you know what a wild dog does?
and I would relish the sight!
Now, they have renewed hope to live.
After a long time...
they have started worshiping again.
Nothing will happen to them.
Hey.
Bend it and whet it.
It must cut through his bones!
All that I can see around you
is death, sir.
Do you see it too?
It's done, sir.
Where are they all going?
They must have found something redder, sir.
Have you ever seen the hunters being hunted?
But he was born mad.
Why are you so late?
The tattoo took some time.
I would have hacked them all by now.
Why didn't you come back here for 25 years?
Why haven't you called me back here for 25 years?
I should have.
Hey...
Have you made friends there?
Many.
More good looking than you.
But they are girlfriends.
I have some too.
But I beat more people than you.
Move it!
We are all violent men.
Violence is in our blood.
For 25 years, I kept the trait suppressed which is 1,000 years old.
I have a childhood story.
This was bound to happen some day.
The ceasefire was only an excuse to fight amongst themselves.
and dream that one day all this would be mine.
Enough fighting for land and honor.
Whatever I can see...
I want it.
Everyone is after my chair.
That is exactly why they will join hands.
will be our own blood.
How can I kill my own blood, Uncle?
What makes you think that uncle and Rudra will join hands against you?
Why do you think Rudra invited Pandit?
Secondly...
Who?
Vaali.
{\an8}Do you know why Rajamannaar obliterated an entire tribe
{\an8}but spared us, the Ghaniyaars?
Because we have no unity.
If we stand united,
Thiru...
Thirdly...
More terrible than the other two...
The sin I committed 25 years ago has come back to hunt me down.
Tell me.
Where are they?
Where is Bhaarava?
Bhaarava?
Your husband is not a Mannaar as you believe.
Then?
Do you know why I built such huge walls around Khansaar?
Who?
The Shouryaangas.
and yet do you know how carefully they hid us?
{\an8}Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait...
What?
all the while, causing internal conflicts in Khansaar to weaken it.
We still feel the pain.
We have been living in hiding...
We have changed our names.
We have changed our identity.
All for this day...
If you don't eliminate your enemy by tonight...
The Constitution.
You beheaded our deity!
All the Shouryaangas are eagerly waiting there.
Except one.
You...
remember Dhaara?
But you killed him.
But...
His son is alive!
You must leave immediately.
Why did you?
But he has returned by himself.
Only one?
Vishnu was killed.
Was it him?
Our leader!
Shouryaanga?
Wait, wait... wait...
not just at the Khansaar gates, but throughout the city!
Whoa!
On the other, thousands of Shouryaangas were ready to burn the chair down.
But...
Deva.
Does Deva know about this?
If he finds out?
No one should survive.
Salaar.
<i>One, two. One, two…</i>
<i>One, two. One, two…</i>
<i>Start on one, two. Okay?</i>
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>
<i>One, two…</i>
<i>I can't get all emotional</i>
<i>I'm just a coward now</i>
<i>These polished sharp words</i>
<i>Breathe it in, can't let it out</i>
<i>A rendezvous during broad daylight</i>
<i>Bibbidi bobbidi boo</i>
<i>Let's work on this lonely love</i>
<i>My heart aches</i>
<i>And today, let's be reborn</i>
<i>We'll be dumb</i>
<i>And fly through the air</i>
<i>Let's forget about the now, la ta ta</i>
{\an8}<i>Let's dance, heat up tonight</i>
<i>Forget about your tears</i> <i>So you can't fall asleep</i>
<i>Don't let it become a lie</i>
<i>Even for me who's not me, la ta ta</i>
<i>I want to shine bright if I'm with you</i>
<i>Apple.</i>
<i>Elephant.</i>
<i>Terrier.</i>
<i>Room.</i>
<i>Maracas.</i>
<i>Squash.</i>
<i>Hamster.</i>
<i>Rhythm.</i>
Hey, Aki.
What was it?
I know, right?
I guess I'm still in orchestra in my dreams.
Before I realized it, I wasn't even holding my violin.
What a weird dream.
One-eyed?
-One-eyed. -Scary.
I was so desperate to find my violin but I couldn't find it.
Yeah, I have dreams where I'm looking for things too.
Then, before I knew it, that one-eyed thing got closer.
-That's so scary. -It was just staring at me.
So creepy!
Then I realized it was just a dream.
I jumped off.
What?
Have you ever fallen asleep in class and woken up with a jerk?
I have…
-Right?! -Yeah.
So I'd thought I would wake up if I jumped off the building.
You just went all out.
What does it mean?
Oh, thanks.
Wait.
I've had that dream before…
Huh?
<i>Taki never came back after that.</i>
<i>I don't care who it is, it can be anybody</i>
<i>Not voices…</i>
<i>I was good friends with Taki.</i>
<i>We both didn't fit in at school.</i>
<i>Our classes, electives</i> <i>and path home were the same.</i>
<i>We both quit orchestra at the same time.</i>
<i>I really liked it.</i>
<i>Taki was the first best friend I ever had.</i>
<i>They suddenly appear from the other side</i> <i>And before we know it, we're taken away</i>
<i>Stay with me today too</i>
<i>Stay with me today too</i>
<i>You guys</i>
<i>You guys took me in</i>
<i>I don't remember it</i>
<i>But your face tells me</i> <i>You want to say something</i>
<i>Everything in my sight</i>
<i>Everything here is all fake</i>
<i>Even if you're compassionate</i> <i>Even if you've given up</i>
<i>Try hard to bite your tongue</i>
<i>Stay there and shut up</i>
<i>It's a lie if I say</i> <i>It's exactly as I imagined</i>
<i>You were sentimental</i>
<i>That's not like you</i>
<i>But that expression on you</i>
<i>That expression, for just a moment</i>
<i>Reflected beautifully in my eyes</i>
<i>For the longest time I yearned for you</i> <i>And I almost lost myself</i>
<i>Overcome the real thing, if you're scared</i>
<i>Stay with me today too</i>
<i>They suddenly appear from the other side</i> <i>And before we know it, we're taken away</i>
<i>Stay with me today too</i>
<i>For the longest time, I yearned for you</i> <i>And I almost lost myself</i>
<i>Overcome the real thing…</i>
Did you have that weird dream?
What is that?
I told you yesterday.
-The one-eyed monster. -The one-eyed monster.
The one-eyed monster.
The one-eyed monster.
THE ONE-EYED MONSTER?
<i>The one-eyed monster.</i>
<i>We went to karaoke, cafés, and arcades.</i>
<i>Taki took me everywhere.</i>
<i>The room where the two of us</i> <i>would sing karaoke</i>
<i>You say you're not a part of this</i>
<i>No matter what, we're not a good match</i>
<i>Laugh at the prank, cheers to your face</i>
<i>I can't tell sweet and sour apart</i>
<i>I'm lost in front of you</i>
<i>Melting away, it's a rendezvous</i>
<i>It'll be platonic</i>
<i>It's a slightly bitter expectation</i> <i>My heart might break</i>
<i>Hey, Taki.</i>
<i>Don't play with my heart and look away</i>
<i>A pink heart forecast</i>
<i>If I tell you now, tell you now</i>
<i>We'll be one</i> <i>And our gazes will fill with love</i>
<i>I was a transfer student.</i>
<i>but it never bothered her.</i>
<i>We weren't good at</i> <i>having conversations with other people.</i>
<i>We didn't speak a word</i> <i>but we could understand each other.</i>
-Oh no, it's gonna end! -What?
<i>One, two, wait for the signal…</i>
<i>But…</i>
<i>Only when I was with Taki,</i> <i>could I speak so naturally.</i>
<i>Taki told me the same thing.</i>
<i>And I thought I could be with her</i> <i>for the rest of my life.</i>
<i>Taki.</i>
<i>The first best friend…</i>
<i>Don't tell me it's too late</i>
<i>Right now</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>There's no right answer</i>
<i>Then where should we go?</i>
<i>Will the story end?</i>
<i>One, two, wait for the signal</i>
<i>I was brave enough to go for it</i>
<i>Phase two</i>
<i>There's no point in being so stiff</i>
<i>It was embarrassing</i> <i>Say goodbye to your dreams</i>
<i>Take care of me forever</i>
<i>Will you?</i>
<i>Right now</i>
<i>Come on! Come on! Get together</i> <i>Turn our gazes away</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>More and more! It comes together</i> <i>And it falls apart</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>
<i>Until we understand each other, we'll…</i>
Taki!
Aki! What are you doing?
I'm going to the roof now. Let's go together.
Okay.
<i>Don't tell me it's too late</i>
<i>Right now</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>
Aki!
Hurry up, Aki!
Wait a minute!
<i>There's no right answer…</i>
-You okay? -Yeah, thanks.
Start on one, two. Okay?
Yeah, I know, Taki.
-Hey, Aki. -Yeah?
<i>Phase two…</i>
Will you?
<i>…Will you?</i>
<i>Hey, Taki.</i>
<i>You're hiding somewhere, aren't you?</i>
Whoa!
What were you dreaming about?
I… fell down the stairs.
It was so scary.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Was I sleeping?
You were completely out.
I'm glad that was just a dream. That scared me.
It happened at those stairs, seriously.
-Really? -Yeah.
Did somebody push you?
-Not sure. -You're not sure?
But I'm glad you're here, Taki.
It's okay. I'm right here.
It was so scary.
<i>I thought she would disappear one day.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Taki.</i>
<i>I lied to you back then.</i>
<i>The dream I really had was one</i>
<i>where you got eaten.</i>
{\an8}<i>I got angry and blew up</i>
<i>I don't expect any sudden changes</i>
<i>Bibbidi bobbidi boo</i>
<i>It's like a good luck charm</i>
<i>I still can't wait to go back</i>
<i>That feeling ran off somewhere</i>
<i>I'll get more and more impatient</i>
<i>I wanted someone to hold my hand tightly</i>
{\an8}<i>I don't know what warmth is</i>
<i>My heart's become poor</i>
<i>The world's filled with beauty</i>
<i>Don't miss it</i>
<i>Come to your senses before the night ends</i>
<i>I want to close my eyes</i>
<i>Boring days like these</i>
<i>You'll definitely want to overcome them</i>
<i>We can't ever forget that</i>
<i>Never ever</i>
<i>Before you know it, time has passed</i>
<i>I don't expect anything while daydreaming</i>
<i>I'll cry in the space between reality</i>
<i>With these feelings that rip up my insides</i>
<i>The words I swallowed sting</i>
<i>All that's left is the absurdity</i>
<i>Thrusting that knife</i>
<i>Tearing your Adam's apple</i>
<i>My fingertips are moist</i>
<i>How to use a fork</i>
<i>I don't even try to look at the truth</i>
<i>I measured the weight of life</i>
<i>The center of the bonfire flickers</i>
<i>What did I see?</i>
<i>Come to your senses before the night ends</i>
<i>I want to close my eyes</i>
<i>Boring days like these</i>
<i>You'll definitely want to overcome them</i>
<i>Until you hear…</i>
NEVER EVER
<i>I'm can't believe I'm still alive</i> <i>How many years is it now?</i>
<i>I'm getting so dizzy</i>
<i>Those heels, where are you going</i> <i>With those flattened shoes?</i>
<i>Don't look at me in contempt</i>
<i>All by myself in this room</i> <i>Soaked with cigarette smoke</i>
<i>It hurts, this restless center of a flower</i>
<i>It's misery</i> <i>The words that want to meet you</i>
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>
<i>Declare your goodbye until you beg</i>
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>
<i>The night becomes faint</i>
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>
<i>Declare your goodbye until you beg</i>
<i>I'm can't believe I'm still alive</i> <i>How many years is it now?</i>
<i>But somehow I feel just fine</i>
-<i>Hey, Aki.</i> -<i>Yeah?</i>
Will you?
Start on one, two. Okay?
One, two…
<i>when I hear Taki play the violin.</i>
<i>It's comfortable, so romantic.</i>
<i>But it also sounded lonely.</i>
<i>but I would be thinking</i> <i>the same things too.</i>
<i>Hey, Aki.</i>
<i>Are you glad you quit?</i>
We can play the violin without being in the orchestra.
I'll quit too then.
What?
It's more fun if it's just the two of us.
Thanks, Taki.
-I can't wait. -Yeah.
<i>There's a brave heartbeat cry</i> <i>In this distorted heart shape</i>
<i>This wretched voice</i>
<i>You also sleep with sadness and loneliness</i>
<i>If the moon hides</i>
<i>I can love you until the depths of tonight</i>
<i>So that it doesn't disappear</i>
<i>I want to hold onto the things I can't see</i>
<i>I wasn't wrong that day, that saving voice</i>
<i>It was lost in this bloodied story</i>
<i>You're not alone anymore</i>
<i>But if it hurts and is a neverending night</i>
<i>I'm sure you won't suspect it</i>
<i>I'm burdened by it all now</i>
<i>We'll get it back</i>
<i>But whenever I woke up from a dream,</i> <i>you were always there.</i>
<i>Taki, I want you back here.</i>
<i>Start on one, two. Okay?</i>
<i>The lights are changing.</i> <i>Please do not rush to cross.</i>
<i>Please do not rush to cross.</i>
<i>I knew it and lamented over it</i>
<i>I threw away my human shell</i>
<i>I can't get out of this small box</i>
<i>Before I knew it, I wanted to escape</i>
<i>I just want to be dumb</i>
<i>I can't ever become anybody</i>
<i>That's why I'm standing on the front lines</i>
<i>Waving that flag nice and high</i>
<i>It's inferior</i> <i>It's a partner you can rely on</i>
<i>Any dramatic turn of events</i> <i>Will result in a Dot Heat</i>
<i>You say yes, yes, take a breath</i>
<i>Swear you'll see me again</i>
<i>I only got one chance</i>
<i>Place our bets on that one moment</i>
<i>My hands sweat like it's the climax</i>
<i>Standing alone, crying out</i>
<i>That truth I hid is nowhere to be found</i>
<i>People who sneered at me have no place</i>
<i>Tears that fall have no reason</i>
<i>A hand that's stretched out</i> <i>There's nothing but doubt</i>
<i>A hole opens with love dripping out</i>
<i>You take a peek at me falling down</i>
<i>Just breathe, all right, all right</i>
<i>I can't ever become anybody</i>
<i>We're fighting each other now</i>
<i>It's overtime, surrender now</i>
<i>Mayday! I'm slightly fond of you</i>
<i>Dripping with words of love and hate</i>
<i>You say yes, yes, take a breath</i>
<i>The directions are over there</i> <i>Headshot! Thoughts clamor in my mind</i>
<i>Shoot out that heart</i>
<i>Pull that string you don't see</i>
Thanks.
Yeah. On a loop.
Lately I've been listening to "Last Dance."
-"Last Dance?" -It's a great song.
I see.
What songs do you like?
Uh…
-Really? -Yeah, really.
So you are listening to it.
What else? Oh, "Heart Forecast."
-They're all good, I can't pick one. -You're right.
Listen to all of them.
I'll listen to "Last Dance."
Yeah, we can dance to it.
<i>This city is overgrown with skyscrapers</i>
<i>You can't take everything I want</i>
<i>Distorting me</i>
<i>We can laugh at the absurdity</i>
<i>Lay on some pretty words</i> <i>Wait for it, rush for it, struggle for it</i>
<i>Crash deep into your ego</i>
<i>Maybe one day again</i>
<i>You'll dance for me like this</i>
<i>Tinged with irritation</i> <i>Young boys and girls</i>
<i>Distracted, the yes-man patient</i>
<i>Nobody's anything</i>
<i>Let's talk until our tongues are dry</i>
<i>I put up a front and lost myself</i>
<i>I'll be dumb and fly through the air</i>
<i>Then I break down</i>
<i>Pure and clear young boy</i>
<i>You do it under the spell of your feelings</i>
<i>I'll think about it</i> <i>In the corner of the world</i>
<i>And a melancholy patient choose tomorrow</i>
<i>Saying goodbye to me, who can never return</i>
<i>Maybe one day again</i>
<i>Taki, I finally remember now.</i>
One-eyed?
One-eyed.
<i>Dream… One-eyed…</i>
<i>Then, before I knew it,</i> <i>that one-eyed thing got closer.</i>
-<i>That's so scary.</i> -<i>It was just staring at me.</i>
<i>Then I realized it was just a dream.</i>
<i>Then I…</i>
<i>I'm laughing at that hoarse voice</i>
<i>Binding these thoughts of nobody</i>

<i>I'm the worst existence ever</i> <i>Don't overlook anything</i>

I jumped off.

<i>You're at the gloomy depths of the night</i>
<i>Fall deep, deep inside</i>
<i>Do I look so ugly?</i>
<i>This is me right now</i>
<i>I'm a corpse that can't become anybody</i> <i>So laugh at me</i>

Thanks.
What's the matter, Aki?
I jumped off.
What?
You went to get refills and never came back.
Then these one-eyed people?
Yeah…
But it's true.
-I see. -Yeah.
You must be tired.
I am… It was a tiring dream.
-I can imagine. -Yeah.
Yeah, let's.
I'm not sure.
Something savory would be nice.
An <i>omurice</i>.
An <i>omurice</i>? Yeah, let's get that.
-We can split it. -Yeah, good idea.
Not sure…
Let's order first.
Good idea.

Excuse me. Babloo.
Sorry, okay.

My name is not Babloo.
Really sorry.
Ohh...
I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. - I just...
Hey loser...
What a drastic change?
Okay.
Listen, Mr. Britain.
Indian girls have an inborn talent.
She can tell it's her guy judging from his shadow.
Look...

Then look in my eyes and say you're not Babloo.
Say it!
I am not Babloo.
I'm leaving.
Strip.
So c'mon hands up, pants down... show the mole.
Hey, hey... hands off.
Okay...
Madam, Babloo's buns are totally clean.
How?
Can I go?
I think there's a problem over there...
- Is everything okay? - Yes, everything is okay.
I almost had him.
Who the hell is Babloo?
Babloo?
Because the world wanted him dead.
Watch out mate!
Found him.
He was hiding in Yorkshire.
You got him.
Babloo should get finished.
His time is over now.
Finished.
Good times will begin now.
Finally, we got this damn Babloo.
So close.
Hey loser how dare you?
You dumbo, I can find a dozen parasites like you.
Money can buy anything, you know.
But your attitude...
Who can endure that?
My attitude...
You know what,
I can do anything with anyone I want.
In fact...
In fact, I can kiss anyone I want.
Inaaya.
Aah...
Babloo.
Babloo?
So...Babloo, nice name, huh.
And I am Debu.
Debu Bhattacharya.
See ya.
Hey, Miss Startled.

Looks like I made your day.
So enjoy it.
Have fun. Okay.
Do I have fungus growing on my lips?
Now you're lucky to kiss Babloo.
Plus you get a big bonus
and a fat tip.
I think I just made your day.
"Hey, Miss. Startled."
"Why so startled?"
"Your heart's gonna be restless as long as it's still beating."
"Hey, Miss. Startled."."
"Hear me out."
"Moments to burn away."
"My own composition."
"Hey ya..."
"Let's hold hands."
"Hey ya..."
"Let's take flight."
"Hey ya..."
"Hey ya..."
"Let's hold hands."
"Hey ya..."
"Let's take flight."
"Hey ya..."
Lights off.
Come on, Miss Startled, let me show you my world.
"Hello."
Hi, you're here?
What for?
She was in the room.
You were in a towel.
- Wait, wait, wait... - What?
Wrap this around. Turn around.
What are you doing?
I'm not that kind of a guy. I don't swing both ways.
- Now raise the towel. - God.
What are you looking at?
- What are you getting. - God...
she saw everything.
"If I ever come across a desert,"
"with no shade to be found."
"Hey ya..."
"Hey ya..."
"Let's take flight."
"Hey ya..."

"Hey ya..."
He's very cool.
Brother.
You look so pretty.
I want all the information on Laila, 31st March and the hard disk.
To measure the enemy's strength,
one needs to find his weakness first.
I've a surprise for you.
So to find the information I'll have to go amongst them.
then why make anyone permanent?
Babloo, this is my brother.
Ranawat.
- Brother. - Just joking.
Okay, brother.
Babloo is a really talented computer genius.
- That's good. - He's helping me out with my game.
I am okay.
That's good! Good.
Welcome to the party.
What a fantastic party you've thrown, Mr. Laila!
It's so much fun. Amazing party.
You're here with your wife today.
You?
Bloodsucking monster!
No one else can even lay a finger on you.
Who will kill me...
He wanted to kill you.
Kill me?
Here's here.
Dented his bumper.
Sorry.
You'll get me killed too.
What a landing!
Open the door, please.
It's a risk.
STOP!
Fine, Miss Startled, I am Babloo.
Finally you accepted.
Opened your mouth.
Get in. Get in.
I guess there's a mole on my bum, because everyone's after it.
Champagne?
Champagne is a drink for two.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
there are several other things,
You know like
holding hands,
love,
Sex?
isn't it?
Yes.
Okay. Yeah.
Cheers.
Cheers.
You bas***
but you didn't let it happen! Because you ran away!
- Ouch... - Does your bum hurt?
- Yes. A lot. - Good.
You know, it was much more painful, when you ditched me and ran.
Where did disappear for 1.5 years,
and why do these people keep firing at you?
I want to know without full stops and commas right now.
Prince Charles, Sheikh of Arabia have stayed here.
This piano... It's a Steiner made.
It's worth 15 million, understand.
And this sculpture, it's Jeff Koons.
It's worth millions.
Why is he naked?
Hey...
Who did you call?
If we don't get the bullet out of your bum, you'll never sit straight again.
Like this. Understood.
Stop him.
- Think. - Where did you go?
Do something.
Rascal, scoundrel, dog, lowlife.
There goes your expensive naked statue. Come on.
Your piano got played.
Let's go.
Wait. Hold this.
Sorry. Please continue.
Come on.
Just...
Finally they found you.
What find me.
We're Saved.
We're Screwed.
What?
- Go away. - Please, please, please.
Always looking for an excuse to stick to me.
One minute, one minute!
Thank you.
Are you a kid?
Sorry.
Oh God!
Babloo!
What now?
Fight them.
Fight them?
They're twenty two. We're just two.
Not two. Only one.
Hey...
Where do you think you are going?
Oh, you.
I'm so sorry about that frying pan, you know...
Kill her.
You shouldn't have hit her.
Guess I'll have to show them what I've got.
Behind you.
It's totally Ustaad's fault, and we've to take the blame.
What if he's not dead?
Ustaad...
Love.
Look into my eyes.
Only my eyes.
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.
You're feeling light as a bird.
When I say one,
you'll turn.
When I say two,
you'll lift your foot.
When I say three,
you'll jump.
Agreed.
One...
Two...
I gave him just one job.
Instead of killing Babloo, who's giving us sleepless nights,
I'll get Babloo.
In two days.
Dead or alive.
sting it, Shenoy,
From dusk to dawn, only two days.
On day three, only Laila knows...
what will become of you.
Okay. Let's all go and eat.
And Ustaad?
Three.
What are you doing?
Madam's phone is unreachable, so I'm trying to come up with an idea.
There's a chip in madam's bag.
and the chip will tell us madam's location.
Clever.
Good boy.
I think I got him.
Okay.
Oh, mummy.
Why did you stop the car here?
Hospitals are full of Police informants.
I know this doctor personally, so...
If they ask your breed,
please say that you're a creep.
Come on you silly girl.
You know what,
I wish the doctor tortures you...
Where is...Dr. Ana?
Dr. Ana's on leave.
My name is Dr. Julia Bulgaria
Nice to see...
Nice to see you.
Okay...
pull down your pants.
I see...
With a doctor like her,
one can even get a bypass, for no reason.
Close your mouth.
Are you okay?
Wake up sweety.
Wake up.
Wait...what am I doing here? And where is Babloo?
He left after the surgery.
Where?
He probably went there.

- Careful. - I really feel like.
- Sit here. - Are we witting here?
Okay.
I mean...
honestly, Babloo.
Babloo, listen...
Where were you for 1.5 years?
Where were you for 1.5 years?
Where were you for 1.5 years?
Asad Khan sent you, didn't he?
The money from our banks disappeared.
It was hacked.
We finally found you, Plumber.
Get him.
You made us run in circles, Babloo.
We finally found you.
You must be wondering how we found you.
You didn't.
I led you here.
Huh?
This is a GPS tracker.
If idiots like you know this,
wouldn't a hacker like me know?
Get him!
Babloo. Babloo. Babloo.
That's it.
Don't think I'll spare you because of her.
Even I'll be rid of her.
Mark, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind? She's Mr. Laila's sister.
Stupid, drop the gun.
Throw the gun!
Kill her...
He said he'll kill my sister.
Brother.
Leave me.
And I would be holding...
a knife.
But my father had complete faith in my aim,
I would wonder what can I do,
I threw the knife differently, and he was terrified.
Fear swept on his face, and I loved it.
So his death is cancelled. Untie him.
Scared?
Look ahead, child.
You're my sole hope.
Protect my son.
How can I be in hell when you're around?
don't try to be a hero.
What shall I do?
Others aren't one,
No one will bother us now.
He had to die owing to his actions.
Always trying to be a hero.
The world wanted you dead.
We found you but in pieces.
But you wouldn't be around.
10 million multiplied by a million.
Bye.
That will be my biggest magic,
and for India, it'll be April Fool's Day.

Babloo?
Ghosts don't kiss.
Trust you!
I just...
This self-centred Inaaya,
And why are you ruining my life?
You were gonna kill me, Babloo.
Today I'll tell you what magic your brother does.
but I have only two.
Asad Khan sent you, didn't he?
Come on, Babloo.
Everybody...
Babloo...
Excuse me. I'm so sorry...please.
Sir, this is huge.
It has multi-layered protection.
Sorry, It's difficult to get in.
Time has a bad habit.
Always slow.
Thirty seconds.
Eight...
Seven...
Six...
Four...
Three...
Two...
Wait.
An official one.
So you must know about Khan's offer, right?
I can offer you 10 times more.
Inaaya...what you want.
He's right.
But sir, this has better features.
Excuse me...
don't comment on my brother.
because now even I'm part of your family.
Ohhh...
I've some important work for you.
Be right back.
Okay.
You work for Laila, don't you? Get in.
- Get in. - You're mistaken.
Get in.
If you want to know about Laila, ask Majnu
I don't know any Laila. Laila who?
Tell us.
Speak up.
Come on. Get up.
What was this?
Another test?
I can settle for lack of skill,
or give my enemies a chance.
Welcome to the family.
"Romantic at heart, I know."
"Yeah, so."
"Romantic at heart, I know."
- Sir... - "Whatever happens now?"
And children will download my gaming apps.
Yeah.
Hip-hip-hurray.
500,000 downloads and counting.
"Romantic at heart, I know."
Keep the lights turned off.
You chose the wrong path.
Fame.
He bestows with respect and shame.
He bestows with respect and shame.
Greed made me turn my back on good,
The relationship I loved,
Both betrayed me.
What justification will my brother give?
And you betrayed your friends, family, and even your mother...
I have no family.
I have no one.
No family.
I was high on becoming rich.
Awesome, you're the man.
We know other ways to get our money.
Everyone's listening.
Pay the money or get out.
She's not worthy of living among decent people!
Only tries to show off.
Hello, I'm from the bank.
She owes us money.
Look at him.
She is not my mother,
Look, madam, enough of this drama.
What will you do?
No!
We are not thieves.
We've been punished for, trying to do something good honestly.
He was saving money.
He wished to start his own ambulance service.
an ambulance never differentiates between caste and creed.
And then suddenly one day,
the money disappeared from our bank.
The Police did nothing.
They said 'PULSE' hacked it.
And now these loan sharks,
People make a wish looking at shooting stars,
but no one fulfils the wishes of a broken person.
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"From the earth to the sky,"
"you're the Lord."
"Hear our guilty plea."
"Hear our guilty plea."
"O Lord...be everyone's benefactor."
"and hear everyone's apology."
"and hear everyone's apology."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"You know of our wishes,"
"You know of our wishes,"
"we've come with our hands folded."
"We don't know how to ask,"
"we're naive."
"We don't know how to ask,"
"We're grateful."
"O Lord...be everyone's benefactor."
"and hear everyone's apology."
"and hear everyone's apology."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"shame means You're upset with us."
"Be convinced, O Lord."
"Be convinced, O Lord."
"Be convinced, O Lord."
but no one fulfils the wishes of a broken person.
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"shame means You're upset with us."
I will fulfil your husband's dream.
Give me my paradise.
- "He bestows with respect and shame." - Give me my paradise.
"He bestows with respect and shame."
"shame means You're upset with us."
"Be convinced, O Lord."
But one needs courage to admit and rectify it.
But this family's wishes will be fulfilled.
But after that, it's all about timing.
Now I'll play this load-download game.
What Laila is thinking,
And after that their 31st March plan is finished.
I must finish everything before Uday arrives.
What's up, Babloo?
Sir, coffee?
He's keeping an eye on you, guys.
It had to happen on the day I wore white.
Clean it up.
What's the progress?
Sir, your hanky.
Sir, our files are encrypted.
Sir, the system is shutting down. We're losing data.
Sir, look at this.
Sir, we're getting malware.
It's Babloo for sure. Call the security. Stop him.
No one goes out.
Lock up.
Security. Don't let Babloo leave.
Don't let Babloo leave.
Babloo, you're working for the country, not Laila.
Freeze!
So strange.
I want Babloo.
At any cost. I want Babloo.
That's my Babloo...
Everyone wants him.
Mother?
Where did she spring up from?
You're the magician.
Lord, You're a bigger magician than me.
Are you Inaaya's brother?
Yes, I am Inaaya's brother.
You see, one of Babloo's stupid friends told me...
Told you what?
That they are lovebirds.
So I thought I should...
What did you think?
So that's what you thought.
That's a fantastic thought.
You're the queen of amazing thoughts.
Don't stand there. Please sit.
Take my cars, my house, I just want Babloo.
Call him.
- Call him. - Yes, yes...
Yeah, mom.
On my way home, mom.
Okay, you know what,
Inaaya's house?
Don't ask stupid questions.
Just come over.
You know what Babloo has done?
Uday...
Aunty, he's coming right?
- Babloo. - Mom...
everyone's looking pretty serious here.
Quiet.
What are you doing?
My son cannot hit anyone.
He swore on me.
or betray my friends.
I can't pull it off.
Say something, mom. Please.
Laila sir...
Mom, now be mum.
What line...
Mr. Laila,
Lower the gun.
Why are you helping him?
Mom I'm really scared please let's leave.
He's a good kid.
I've sent you something, Dogra.
Take a look.
Let's go, mom.
He blackmailed me, Laila sir.
- Make porn, never do it. - Forgive me.
Sell it, never watch it.
Where is everyone going?
He's a hacker.
He'll hack your thoughts too.
Relax.
Wait no!
Khan sir kept his promise,
left my old life behind,
Ms. Startled.
We're at the same crossroads again.
Same old brother, same old partners,
and my creation PULSE which I had blocked.
This Laila has three heads,
who are hiding in three corners of the world.
One in China, one in Russia, and one in Egypt.
anarchy will run wild,
It will be India's biggest scam.
It will affect every person.
stocks, everything will turn to zero.
Families will be ruined.
There will no hopes or dreams left.
That's my promise.
No one suspects the dead.
They are only feared.
I have only 100 hours.
And my God.
But you were dead.
Attack.
I hacked your game,
- Gloria, I am home. - Just die!
Kill the bad guy!
Come on.
Gloria.
I need to go out.
Yes!
It's unfortunate that all three...
Laila sir...
Please...
Laila sir, cancel the plan.
Dogra, listen to me.
This entire game is Laila's plan.
It won't change.
Babloo's fake mother's flight is landing at five.
Abduct her.
If Babloo is alive,
And remember...
Heathrow Airport Terminal one.
Five o'clock.
I'll send his mother's picture.
You sure Laila said Heathrow?
Yes.
What's up, buddy?
No, thank you. I can do it.
Babloo's mother.
Where is Babloo?
Babloo has sent me.
Why didn't Babloo come?
Yes.
I've come to deliver you to him safely.
Hey...I'm not some parcel you can deliver.
Just take care.
So Mr. Babloo, your mum's at Gatwick airport, not Heathrow.
Move.
If anything happens to my mother,
Dust on old promises, trust in new relationships,
Go on...
Aunty, Babloo's here.
Babloo.
- My son. - Mom.
- Miss you. - Are you okay?
What can happen to me?
I prayed for you at all the four pilgrim sites.
My child.
Aunty, since you entered his life,
This tiger has become a cat.
He's got nine lives thanks to you.
Take her blessings.
I convinced her with my words, and she believed me.
My son.
Ashamed of me?
- Yes, I am ashamed of you. - Ashamed of me?
Look...
Once I get the money,
I'll order a dozen sisters like you online.
Cash on delivery.
Same day return if she's not loyal.
Ashamed of me?
Now we'll always go together wherever we go.
I mean...
first mother then the son. Or first son then mother.
Aunty, that's my sister.
Mother-daughter kill time,
till then we brothers-in-law have a little one-to-one. Okay.
Mom...
- You're so beautiful. - Thank you.
Listen you rascal, I've had enough of your games.
You won't survive either.
This time I brought dozens.
Yes mom.
Look Babloo, don't insult my magic.
It's true. You're a fraud. Fraud.
I can hack your brain. Hypnotize you.
Do it.
Leave my mother out.
Abracadabra. Hocus pocus.
Mom...
What happened, mom?
Now your mom won't wake up for 5-7 minutes.
Mom wake up please...Mom...
Mom wake up...
Now no one can save you from me.
Babloo, look. Look here.
Get him.
No, Babloo.
Babloo no...
Babloo, did that hurt?
You can't touch me or my computers.
Five minutes.
Save them if you can, Babloo.
Five minutes to go.
Babloo.
What happened, Babloo?
But to kill Mr. Laila,
Welcome to my tunnel.
Bend Down.
This way.
Side.
Come on, Babloo. Time's racing ahead of you.
Babloo, look out!
If you had understood on time,
that all this is fake.
Then you wouldn't have lost time.
Level 1 failed.
You failed Babloo.
Bye.
Three minutes thirty two seconds to go...
An important announcement. All of India's banks money is shortly coming into my pocket.
Babloo, can you stop me?
Come on, horsey...
Two minutes eighteen seconds to go...
Let's go, my king.
You own nothing, and you won't survive either.
Babloo.
Level two failed as well.
Level 3.
Only two minutes left, Babloo.
Babloo.
Time's evaporating like smoke.
One minute thirty two seconds to go...
Babloo.
You got me.
You got me.
One minute eleven seconds to go...
One minute four seconds to go...
Fifty four seconds to go...
You've lost Babloo.
I will destroy everybody in India.
You've a pathetic level, Laila.
Always hiding.
Twenty six seconds to go...
Twenty five seconds to go...
Babloo.
Mom.
What an actor?
Initiating final countdown.
Ten..
Nine...
Eight...
Seven...
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One...
Ohh...what happened, Laila?
No current?
Look your magic is finished.
No...no.
No.
Laila can never lose.
My magic cannot fail.
Real heroism is not beating people,
it's about winning people's hearts.
But that's one trait you don't have,
Only I do.
Bye.
Eyes... paralyse... hypnotise...
Eyes... paralyse... hypnotise...
Life's full of surprises.
Long Live Laila.
Long Live Laila.
This is magic! Not reality!
Greetings from Vietnam.
Vietnam's right under your eyes.
God bless you two.
Always be together.
May your love grow every year.
Don't worry, mom,
because now Babloo's my responsibility.
Come, I have to show you something.
Go on.
- Yeah? - Hello, Plumber.
Architect.
Khan.
"We're gonna have a blast."
"The magic's gonna work."
"Everyone's gonna be surprised."
"We're gonna have a blast."
"The magic's gonna work."
"Everyone's gonna be surprised."
"Who cares..."
"Just whistle along."
"Just whistle along."
"Just whistle along."
"Keep having a blast."
"No need to worry."
"Keep having a blast."
"No need to worry."
"We're gonna have a blast."
"The magic's gonna work."
"We're gonna have a blast."
"The magic's gonna work."
"Everyone's gonna be surprised."
"Who cares..."
"Just whistle along."
"Just whistle along."
Rhona!
- No fucking way.
- Oh my god, you're such a bitch.
Karma's a real bitch, you know that?
- Oh, and by the way, when it comes to Donnie, just
try to not act like such a pussy around him.
- Hey, nice boots cowboy.
- You've really got a plan.
- I like to set realistic goals.
- The map's upside down.
I'm drenched.
Fucking great.
- Thanks for the input.
well I only took the one.
- Wait, come help me with something.
- So, where'd you serve?
- So Carla, right?
- Just thought I'd try and lose myself for a while.
- We're heading off in search of Rhona's lost cabin.
- I think I was just sick in my mouth.
that's a day's trek into the woods.
It was probably the only thing he couldn't sell off.
Does X mark the spot?
that she should be doing.
So, why don't you lose yourself in the woods with us?
To finding treasure.
- Fit as, pal.
- 'Nother round?
I don't like strangers.
Are you okay?
- That was insane.
You're a proper bad ass.
- Come here.
- I love you.
- Yeah of course.
Goodnight then.
- Goodnight.
- Paper Andy, really?
Well excuse me.
- Okay, so we've got a fouror five hour hike to Mercy Falls.
- Wait, have you set an emergency plan?
You know, in case anything goes wrong.
I'd still like to leave one with the lodge.
But, yeah, thanks.
You so did.
Am I a skank?
- Whoa!
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah I'm just...
CARLA May I see the map.
It's just beyond the ridge.
We'll never make it.
- I don't need it.
Now get back up there.
- Don't tell me you lost the guide?
- It's just- - Get back here!
- I can't hear, anything.
Like walking really fast and marching.
- Don't ever run away from me again!
Where do you think you're going?
- How did you do that Carla?
Slip away like that?
- Had plenty of practice.
they've cut the circulation off to his brain.
that not scare you a little bit?
- I think that was kind of the point though, right?
Mercy Falls.
I can't walk another step.
I hate this.
This is my speciality.
- Don't worry, I've got quite the appetite.
Tell me it's nearly ready.
- Yeah, yeah couple more minutes.
- You know that Billy Connolly sketch about big banana feet?
- Okay, whatever that means.
- What is that, before Christ?
Oh Heather, stop it!
- Hey man, a woman has needs.
If you're not taking care of them, someone else will.
of goddesses and old shite.
- Do not tell me to chill out.
- Come on Scott.
- Such a prick.
No.
It's scary.
- They say that it happens on cold, moonless nights,
when there's not a whisper of wind around.
Lone, lost hikers, look to the water for solace.
The sirens.
enchanting,
interesting
women in the world.
Only they're not of this world.
their moment to escape,
that there is no escape.
You're completely captured by their web.
Destined to be a victim
You okay?
Right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Scott, Scott check your phone.
Okay, we're gonna get you outta here.
Carla, do something!
Three definite wounded.
- You fucking killed him.
- He was already dead.
It would have been excruciating and slow.
- What help Rhona?
We're a full day's walk away from anywhere,
no roads, no phones,
no fucking help.
These are the wild lands, love.
- You can't go to the police.
- There's a dead body here.
- No you're not.
It was an accident.
- Sure you did.
That Andy wasn't much of a hiker.
- You can't be fucking serious.
Either Andy was never here,
or we all going to prison with Scott.
One lie and one life,
and all our lives.
- I want to bury him.
- Don't act all high and mighty now do you?
You're the reason he's dead.
- I'm the reason he's dead?
Rhona! - What?
Glad I'm not the only one that thinks this plan is bat shit.
- I'm not making it about me just
at Barlanark Psychiatric Hospital.
and an Afghan woman."
- You need calm down and pretend like we haven't seen that.
Just go and talk to Donnie.
You saw the boots he was wearing.
and she took that knife to his throat and she killed him.
It was an accident, Scott.
It was an accident and you know it.
- Just be ready.
Okay.
- Rhona, get up here.
We'll try and find you a better vantage point.
Can you climb?
- I'll try and spot the cabin,
- Doesn't exactly seem the type.
I remember it as a child.
I can't Rhona.
I've got an idea.
We need to get across.
- I fucking hate heights.
- You go next.
- I'm sorry.
I'll die of dehydration!
- You can't drink it like that, slow down.
- I need a minute.
Why a cabin?
why leave you a cabin?
- He wasn't an evil man.
Misguided,
flawed even.
When life was simple.
Except for that last time.
and we came upon this horse stuck in a trap.
No idea where it came from.
It's energy was so drained,
and it must've been screaming and screeching out for hours.
But when we got there, it kinda just lay there.
It didn't try and pull away,
it just looked up with these weary eyes.
- So he just helped it die.
I ran.
I hated him so much for that.
- An irresistible sleep fell deeply on his eyes,
the sweetest, soundest oblivion,
We've been here too long.
- You deserved that.
No, I never want to see her again.
This whole mess...
She and I are done.
Heather?
Heather!
You fucking bitch!
No.
Please, please.
Rhona we can't leave her.
We have to...
No, no. - Come on.
Just over that next hill I think.
- That's it.
I found the radio.
- It's working.
- Scott, you know this only goes one of two ways, right?
It's her or us.
- I don't know what to do.
- Neither do I.
But if I can't,
then I'm gonna die trying.
- She's killed all of our friends
and she's coming to kill us now.
I'm gonna kill the fucking cunt.
how do you want to do this, exactly?
We're gonna trap her.
- And if it doesn't work?
- It has to work.
This'll work.
We set our trap.
- We need to wear her down, make her slow.
The less focused she is, the better chance we'll have.
but let me first do some great thing
that shall be told amongst men hereafter.
For our friends.
- For our friends.
- Are you looking for me?
Come in Mercy Falls Cabin,
And I'll make it quick.
Not a single birthday came,
when I peacefully wished him "Happy birthday, Papa".
then you'll understand how I feel.
who had a sexy daughter,  a young princess.
and this monkey shows up and starts mimicking and teasing her.
then the monkey splashes water back at her ..... and he goes...
Princess gets upset, obviously.
"Papa, there is a toxic monkey in the jungle teasing me."
"He is making such lewd gestures."
The king gets furious.
Go and deal with him."
And the monkey says ,"What do you think you're doing, dude?"
Whatever the minister did or said,
the monkey would repeat it.
The minister gets all confused
and starts racking his brain.
He summons two swords,  one real and one fake.
He keeps the fake one for himself
Then he took the fake sword
The monkey sees this
grabs the real sword, and goes
Animals are multicellular organisms
in the biological kingdom Animalia.
The word "animal" comes  from the Latin animalis.
Where are you going?
- How dare you disturb my class? - Ma'am, my sisters have come.
SHOW ME YOUR HAND!
Hand up.
Just go and kneel down there till the class gets over
- Understood? Yes, ma'am.
And that one star is you
I have no one but you
Papa my life, keep your hand on my head every moment
Papa!
You are the stone in every river
keep your hand on my head every moment
Papa!
You are the stone in every river
Papa!
Mom!
Mom, where's Papa?
You know he is a very busy man.
He had to rush to the factory, son.
Hey, let's make a clone of your father,
But no matter how many lookalikes we find,
no one can compare to him.
Papa!
You are with me in my head  no matter where I go,
whether you are there or not.
You are always there in my sight, - Papa!
Papa!
The kids made a cake for you.
They waited for you,
but got tired and went to bed.
Don't worry, Jyoti.
They notice everything, you know?
And it bothers them.
You know what he said yesterday?
to Balbir Singh II.
I argued, but he said,
why not Balbir Singh II?
I hope you realise  you are his superhero
Papa!
I want you to be my son
I hope you understand.'
- Happy birthday to your father! -Thank you. Thank you.
I was finally going to meet him after the third-grade final exams.
I really love my father.
Everyone loves their parents.
What do you mean by "more than anything"?
With time. - How?
Well, it's like studying all year and then getting grades that tell
if my love for my father
Just today.
- Listen, tomorrow is Papa's 60th birthday. - Got it.
You're the only one missing  from the pictures.
Come with me.
Yeah, it's happening in two days
No one remembers the school song, dude.
Where the hell did you disappear to, huh?
Joyous song we now recite
Believing that our dreams are bright
A better brighter tomorrow!
When did you get back from America, Brother?
You totally look like  an American now
And thank you so much for playing the school song, Brother.
It brought back all those childhood memories.
one of those friends  as her honorary brother
You know why?
I have my own sisters.
I know that feeling.
I don't have sister-like feelings for you.
So, do you feel the same way about me as you feel about Kartik?
What are you saying?
Tell me.
Geetu!
Let's go.
So what happened?
I said yes for the engagement.
So you said yes for the wedding too.
Yes.
Do you love him?
We talked on the phone for a week
and we got engaged today.
You know how girls used to choose  their husbands back in the days?
Back in the days?
Let's go back in time.
Centuries ago, there were two types of men...
Alphas were the tough ones
would divide the hunted food among themselves.
The women were not only responsible for nourishing the children,
That's how communities operated.
However, their influence extended beyond the kitchen,
from the rival hunters  and wild creatures.
I mean, a bunch of Arvinds or an Alpha?
Alpha.
Exactly.
So, when all the women started choosing strong men,
the weaker ones got jealous.
That's when poetry came into the picture.
"THI cross the seven seas for you."
"I'll get you this, I'll get you that."
But they never really do anything.
The only oneswho actually do something are the...
Alphas.
Gitanjali
You have a big pelvis.
No, no, I'm not trying to say you are fat.
What I mean to say is you have a big pelvis.
Thank you, guys.  Thanks for coming
Thank you. - Kartik...
Yeah?
Is there any chance that I can get married to Gitanjali?
What?
Is there a chance?
What are you saying, man?
Forget about that.
Hey, relax and start your engines.
Why did all of you stop  your bikes, huh?
- You should leave. -All this drama started because of your aunt.
Your aunt must have seen something in Gitanjali's eyes for me,
which made your aunt tell her to address me as brother.
Ninth grade?
She said yes.
She said yes means she said yes.
She even invited me to her house.
"Who is he, my child?"
Don't you dare laugh!
Did Gitanjali ever call any one of you "brother"?
In school or after school?
No. - No. - Never.
She calls me brother  when I'm with them
but uses my name when we're alone
Bros.. I've noticed that too.
won't your body react?
I had a high fever.
Ask her, she must have had it too.
And it's not like these emotions  have suddenly resurfaced today.
This feeling was, is, and will always be there.
She's not going anywhere.
- What? -She's not going anywhere.
She'll come running to me.
Brother...
She's talking to you.
Kalra.
Varun..
Where is everyone?
They're on their way, Papa.
What Is It?
You, Grandpa, and me
Okay
Varun
It's a big achievement.
Well done.
Papa, it's my birthday gift to you.
Well done, son.
Thank you, Grandpa.
It's good that we were able to organize
Come here, my boy. Come here
Happy birthday, Papa.
Thank you, Reet. That's a terrific watch
What happened to your hair?
Papa, the other one who has this watch is the King of England.
What is he doing here?
Shh.
Varun's younger brother.
It's very classy
Happy birthday, Papa.
You didn't get anything for Papa?
You came empty-handed from America?
I've cut my hair.
It's Papa's 60th birthday.
- A haircut, really? Roop, a haircut is a commitment.
It's a very special gift
Nice haircut.
It suited you.
I'll grow it again, Papa.
This was the perfect opportunity to make things right.
Come on.
We didn't personally go there to invite them.
Come on guys, the photographer's waiting.
Grandpa?
Yes, my boy?
None of your family ever visits us.
It'd take me forever  to explain it to you.
You still remember our village. my boy?
Oi Hero, come.
Now that you're back,
you need to know who the big players are.
Come.
I am not interested in this game.
It's fine.
See you later - See you, Grandpa.
That's a tough question.
Let's see what you do.
What are you doing, Roop?
Don't get into whiskey.
Have wine, it's good.
Who wrote that? "Happy birthday Balbir."
Everyone knows whose birthday it is.
It won't kill you to say hello to someone.
You have upset a powerful man
He heard you.
If you want to take over the Empire,
I've inherited this attitude, Varun.
It's in my blood.
There you two go again with this argument.
if he wants to do business in India,
How far can you see?
Alright, we know how smart you are, now shut up
It surprises me, Reet,
even with your MBA from Harvard,
all you say is shut up and stop it.
So sad
Why, Varun?
Is my sister not allowed to speak up in your house?
The point is that CM is our guest  and we need to show him respect.
The point is, that you're not representing  Varun Pratap Malhotra,
You don't need to bow down to them.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why didn't his security leave  their guns at the gate?
There is no protocol  in this compound!
Reet, you noticed?
What's your deal, Roop?
You planning to join the business in future
Idiot.
to be the Prime Minister  in the next 10 years.
Then he will wait for me.
Champ!
Hey!  Mishra uncle
I'm doing great
You haven't changed one bit
Come on, let's grab a drink
and talk about your time in America.
Why just the PM
even the American President will be waiting for him.
Varun, don't instigate him.
Please don't do this right now.
What do you mean,  don't instigate him?
Why are you talking about me
You should've said detonate  instead of instigate.
Hmm.
50,000 crore and not even one single partner.
So, this is what you've been doing in the US... you track all this?
What do you mean by "track"?
I don't like the way you spoke to him.
What are you saying, Reet?
Hey Mr. Golden Spoon,
crash a couple of sports cars.  have some flings.
You belong in space.
You're turning a positive win  into a negative
trying to protect the king with a sword?
There is only a monkey's difference  between bravery and stupidity.
How dare you say that?
I already did Reet
- Apologise to him right now!  - Tell him to apologise!
Don't interfere between  my sister and me, okay?
Are you crazy?  Please stop it right now.
Apologise right now to him.
I won't apologise to him.
Apologise
who wants to marry you.
There are many great guys out there,
I know some of them personally.
Trust me, if you don't listen to me,
you'll regret it.
One day, I will put a "the end" on both these brothers.
But there's no point saying anything now.
She's got two kids.
Why didn't you go to Gitanjali's engagement party?
You guys were best friends  in school, right?
What happened?
You don't like hanging out  with middle-class people?
No Brother, it's not like that.
have done for this country.
- Brother...  Yeah?
Are you seriously going  to kill both of them?
Then relax
You too started it again, Papa.
Come again.
You too started it again.
Go and apologise to him.
You don't want to know what happened?
Then don't you think I am making sense, Papa?
every big businessman in South sees us as an enemy now.
Papa, what I am trying to say is...
Just go and apologise to him.
Right now.
No.
Ten minutes.
Reet...
What happened, Reet?
Who are you trying to call?
I want to talk to Papa
Why, what's wrong?
Okay. Tell me what happened.
They're ragging the hell out of students in college
I can't handle it
What does ragging mean?
Did they insult you?
What will you do?
They are final-year  mechanical students.
Get in, Reet.
Heat and mass transfer
This one?
A classic example of heat and mass transfer
- Let's go. -...exiting the machine gun.
Who messed with my sister?
What has life come to, man!
Even schoolkids think they can question us now.
Ma'am, this kid is disrupting the class.
Why don't you stop him?
Oi Mowgli...
I'll ask again... who messed with my sister?
Wait here, Reet. I'll be right back.
Ragging season hasn't even  started yet, madam.
You've got a lot more to witness.
Sir, I will tell you everything.
They left after lunch.
Lokesh, Sanjiv, Karan, Dimpy.
Can you come back tomorrow, sir?
You'll find them here.
If anything like this happens in college,
you should inform me right away.
You shouldn't wait until  things get out of hand.
You want me to study there or not?
Just wait until Papa finds out about this.
That's our college, Reet.
What's the point if you're not even safe
in our own damn college?
Don't worry, this isn't over yet.
I'll be going back tomorrow.
You don't need to be anyone for me.
Please let them go.
Let's go, let's go.
Go faster!
Have you lost your mind?
Let me concentrate.
He is going to kill us!
You took a gun to college?
Have you lost your freaking mind?
How dare you!
And then you fired the gun also?
You don't have the time to do all this.
Come again?
You could have gotten arrested!
YOU COULD HAVE ENDED UP IN JAIL!
If I withdraw my support...
Just do it, Papa.
I will never forget it.
JYOTI!
JYOTI,
What happened?
And I am sure he doesn't even care
if those boys are dead or alive!
You'll see come tomorrow,
Balbir!
- What happened? - You want to know what happened?
What?
Two minutes, Papa.
Do you really think I made a mistake?
You didn't make a mistake,
you were busy
You were not available, Papa.
I am...
I am responsible for everything  that happens in this house.
Don't ever call me a criminal, Papa.
If the son of the richest man
in the country can't protect his sister,
then what's the use of all this?
Tell me Papa, what is the use of all this?
Couldn't you see that Reet is upset?
You should've let me know!
That's it.
Reet!
Next time something like this happens,
I won't just scare them,
Balbir!
I don't know that.
You just go and apologise to Varun.
Roop, come here.
I know, Brother.
Come here.
Do you trust me?
Varun, I shouldn't have talked  to you like that.
What is going on?
Papa, did you say something to him?
Hey, did I ask you for an apology?
So then?
There is no need for all this.
Papa, it's okay.
Excuse me, Papa.
Hmm.
Why did he call him "Papa"?
He should call him sir.
Shut up.
I can call him Papa,  he is my father.
He is Papa for you, Reet, and me.
Papa is so strange.
He called him Papa and he just accepted it.
Yes.
Come.
You carry on.
You've never experienced  my childhood.
I'm sure I made some mistakes.
I didn't know how to train a son.
You trained me well, Papa.
Take care of your family
You missed the chance to wina  gold medal.
I sent you to learn discipline.
let's go and enjoy the party.
I know what your problem is.
You think I am giving your share to Varun.
Did you really mean what you said, Papa?
The Fact is Varun is more disciplined.
He is capable.
He is in control.
He is hardworking.
Varun is someone you can never become.
Perfect.
Varun is a good guy.
You taught him how to ride a bike.
Actually, Varun is your son.
I'm your bastard son.
You're brave, Papa.
we can't even stay  in the same country.
Get out of my house.
Where are you going with your bags all packed up?
Are you okay?
Come.
Kartik...
It's over, bro.
Ten minutes, sir.
You want some water?
Congratulations on your engagement.
What?
Papa,
I want you to meet somebody special.
Gitanjali, come.
Come.
Papa, this is Gitanjali.
Papa...
I didn't return with the intention of staying here, Papa.
We are getting married, Papa.
Papa...
Balbir?
Papa, what are you doing here?
Come. Please.
Uncle, please join us.
What kind of example are you setting, Geeta?
What will the other kids learn from this?
This is so wrong.
Geetu, I'm here.
Hello, Mom. Hello, Papa.
Geetu, my love, you're not ready yet?
-What's going on? - Hey bro, listen...
Come on - Come with us.
- What is it? Just come with us.
What? - Try to understand.
What childhood love story?
Then why did she waste my time, huh?
Do you even know what you are doing?
The groom has changed.
Geeta, if this is what you wanted,  you should've told us.
We've known him since  he was a little kid.
You stop talking, Kartik.
Why will she explain, huh?
Get up, Geeta.  Just get up!
And I lost all control.
That kind of love,
That kind of love,
I want to love you with such intensity,
Like I am experiencingthis craziness for the first time,
I emerged from prayers,  I am yours entirely,
Both our worlds, Came to a halt, frozen in time.
I cannot bear
Open your eyes.
You are my guiding force,  I'll be your sheltering cloud.
Kashmir?
Something like Kashmir.
That's where we're going to get married
I emerged from prayers, I am yours entirely,
I am your one and only.
Priest, let's just skipto the important stuff?
[Sanskrit Chants]
What?
How was it?
For you?
You know, that gravitational shift,
I was on top,
My mind was focused on the throttle,
you were on the bottom,  nothing much for you to do.
it was our first time.
Obviously, it was a little...
But the peak was...
I have no words.
Let's do it here, with gravity today.
and talk about it tomorrow, hmm?
Yeah.
Nobody's here.
It's just us. Look.
It's our private airstrip.
Nobody going to pay it any mind.
No, but you don't understand. What if someone sees?
You have a gun?
Yes.
You know how to shoot a gun?
No, no, but you are saying  you are carrying a...
Gitanjali, do you want to experience the gravity or not?
Hmm?
- Do you? - Stop...
I want to be a father.
You won't be like your father, right?
What do you mean, I won't be like my father.
Please don't say that.
Don't ever go there.
anything dirty, like whether I watch porn,
And I'll always give you  an honest answer,
but not this.
I'm sorry.
Gitanjali,
Yes, I am...
Bro, I've rigged the area With Jammers
No one can make any phone  or video calls for the next hour.

Why are we taking this entrance?
To take him by surprise.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
Silence!
Close your eyes.
- Silence! - Close your eyes.
Stay back.
Come on.
Sit down.
Sit down.
- Close your eyes.  - Stop!
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here to do something.
It's a two-minute job and it won't take much time,
if you just... close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Sit. Sit down.
Shh. - Close your eyes.
Yo Uncle, do you need a special invite or something?
Close your eyes.
Hurry up.
that same evening, he brought  them to stay at his hotel.
Where is he?
What's up with this crappy detergent here?
My underwear is all stff  and uncomfortable
The texture is all messed up.
We're just used to it, right?
It's all about comfort, bro - Yes.
Rubbish
Hmm
When's Freddy coming to show us the demo?
He said tomorrow.
He always says tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
He knows.
Gitanjali, please.
What happened to you?
What is this?
Or are you going that seven-years itch theory?
This is just a costume, Gitanjali, not clothes.
You don't need it.
Don't you know me?
What?
What happened?
What?
You think normal people live like this?
We are not normal people.
After what happened at home,
And those are not security guards; they're my brothers.
I feel like I've been replaced  by your cousins.
Gitanjali, come on, let's do it in the washroom.
Fine, let's do it on the sofa.  Come on.
Got it?
I'll change your mood in no time, come on
Shall I call for the plane again?
Is it possible?
Yeah,
but what about the kids?
The way they're sleeping,
I can ask Sheela also to take care of the kids.
Is this normal?
You win.
Papa!
What happened. Reet?
Varun still hasn't returned home.
Nobody knows where he is.
I tried reaching his brother too, but his phone's off too.
Mom, there is no point  coming and crying here.
Papa is fine.
Look at your son's confidence.
Reet, where does Varun usually hangs out?
Do you know who else he meets besides work?
Reet, if you know where he goes and who he meets,
then I can send some people there to check.
I don't know where he goes and who he meets.
I just know there is something terribly wrong
This has never happened before.
Sister?
What happened?
Is everything okay?
His brother's phone's off too.
That's why Reet's worried.
I don't like this.
We were so happy in the US.
I'm not happy here.
Happiness is a decision, Gitanjali.
I don't know why we came back.

Even the surgeons didn't know

Sir, please, it's time to take rest now.
So please...

then we can definitely  track down our enemies
The same hands that construct skyscrapers...
The same hands that shape molten steel...

no matter where he is hiding.
in the sky or underground..
Whether it's the day hiding him  or the night...
Power! Progress! Victory! - The third generation entrepreneur,

But he is my father.

Get to the point, Brother.
I want my family
my brothers,
after all these years seeking help.
What's the plan?
Come with me.
To Delhi.
When did you come, Brother?
You should have informed me, guys.
That speech was something else!
Everyone in college is talking about it.
All ties were severed years ago.
he expects our kids to follow him?
When my elder brother passed away,
I blamed his grandpa for it.
But this boy's about to fight a battle.
Son, this here's a homecooked meal
I'm sure you'll like it.
Took me back 25 years.
Don't worry
He said a couple of nice things,
Don't you have any pride?
I'm going with him.
Count me in, too.
he can buy all the security in the world.
But Paali, he isn't here looking  for security and power.
Right, and he thought about his brothers after 20 years, huh?
Don't make me smack you.
Go and prepare for your exams.
They're just naive kids but you know better.
Paali, personal differences don't matter
The seed we're planting today.
our future generations will draw examples from it,
of how brothers stood upfor each other.
He expects all of us to go along.
This is what I wanted to hear.
Huh? What?
I'll be damned.
Then it's all good
Open the gate
Open the fucking gate
Sorry buddy.
Rules have changed.
What?
Balbir Singh?
Oi! Get out!
-What's going on Papa? - Did the kids like their new school?
-Now they're going to ask my husband They'll take some time,
- to show his passport before they let him in? - but they'll be okay.
Mishra,
why did he stop Varun at the gate?
and sort things out
You'll be fine, Papa.
You'll be absolutely fine.
We'll discuss about Varun in detail later.
Papa, meet Kailash.
He's going to be your body double.
Kailash.
Sit.
After detail observations and body scans,
we found that this guy matches your body type.
Mom, not even Roop or Reet.
while I hide at home?
I have so many meetings every day.
This is impractical and dangerous.
And he won't be going everywhere,
You can work from home for a few days.
This is not a small deal.
It's a very drastic step.
But we don't have a single piece of actionable information.
That means they have bigger plans.
making these plans.
I can't seek your permission  for everything.
Oi, Sangram.
what?
Who are they?
Get up, girl.
who is he?
House owner.
Manjot, I thought you were  in a serious relationship?
Is this what you do when your wives aren't around?
Any of them can have a hidden camera on them.
Come on, get them out.
Hey!
Leave, you pimp.
How can he talk like this?
Our well-wishers.
They won't come back.
Do you really think we can bring them back here?
Don't worry about the security, Brother.
Then why four girls?
Does your family know about this?
Does anyone's family ever know about all this?
This won't happen again
Don't fuck around, guys.
just like you guys are staying away.
Dude...
Sorry, babe.
Come on!
Kailash... use your left hand,  not your right hand
This fucker is a funny guy.
He's completely confused  about left and right hands.
What happened, Brother?
How the hell would we know  which hand Uncle uses?
Shut up, bro.
Hi, Papa.
Long time no see
You are looking well.
See you, Papa.
He just gave me some papers.
Whether known or not by you,
You don't call the shots around here.
You were right.  It's a live call
Balbir is alive.
The man you killed was his body double.
Body double?
Where did this body double even come from?
His son made one.
and you had no clue about it?!
That you screwed up?
As long as he's around,  we can't get to Balbir.
How many more Balbirs has this guy made?
Asrar, listen to me.
Prateek!
Kairan!
What's this?
This is my special handcrafted underwear.
Feel it.
It's not like your regular underwear with a long trunk.
And your crappy detergent
ruined my underwear!
What happened?
What "what happened," huh? I've got a rash down there.
A rash? Let me see.
It's okay.
Show me.
Don't worry they will close their eyes.
- Come on, show. - Come on, Gitanjali, do you really...
What happened, sir?
Come here.
that makes all clothes soft, even innerwear.
GO!
Jolly mood?
Sir...
Lift it up.
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
Did you shave?
Yes, sir.
God didn't give you any hair on your head,
Have some sense.
Listen, just give me one day,
by tomorrow you will have 365 new pair of underwear.
Okay?
Don't wear anything today.
Yeah...
Brother, you got us all suited up while
Freddy.
You're the one who talked to our engineer on the phone?
Hmm.
What a vision!
What a thought!
My team is going crazy.
Let's get straight to the point.
These guys are no saints.
They got no history.
- Hey! - Hey!
Never touch my shoulder
Don't cross the line.
They got no discipline or manners.
- Hey! - Hey!
Keep quiet.
They should.
I usually don't make deliveries in person.
I came here, especially for that man.
The man who briefed my team about this machine.
I am the Boss.
Hey! Where the hell are you?
As soon as you know  shit's about to go down,
then headphones are a must.
For the ones with turbans,  use earbuds. Okay?
Good. Now coming to this--
Put on your headphones.
Move! Move fast!
Freddy, give me your underwear.
Hand over your underwear. What?
What...
what are you going show me, huh?
Hey you, come here.
Hey!
This is how you fucking shoot!
The discussion is getting dull,
It's time to celebrate,Let's head to the square, my buddy,
There are drinks hidden; come on, let's get rowdy.
Brother, grab some appetizers, too,
Pintya, it's time for crazy disco dancing, me and you,

You guys done with the first aid?
or we'll be stuck in traffic.
Jitta
There are too many of them, Brother!
- With this, it started a fight... - Go for it!
Truly there is no peace at all.
The brutality of battlefield will destroy the world of Bachno.
This is no fun, Manjot.

- A valiant warrior found that all of his friends
Go for it!
A valiant warrior found  that all of his friends,
Stood resolutely by his side like lions, on the battlefield.
Heads up, bro!

I could not find any evil.
When I looked within,
Paali!,
Yes!
Fuck you!
Brother, he's getting an incoming call from his brother.
Asrar, where are you?
You called to check if the job was done, right?
Asrar?
I'm still alive.

Don't worry, my son is a tough guy he'll take it.
Papa
Six gunshot wounds
deep wounds in the back
multiple concussions to the head
Because your adrenal was  so high you couldn't feel it.
None of us thought you would live.
You've lost your sense of taste  and smell because of the concussions.
One bullet hit in your chest area
very close to your heart,
one punctured the lower lobe of your left lung
and we've removed one bullet
from your lower abdomen
Catheter? You mean a silicone pipe?
Up my penis?
Yes
A 45 cm silicone pipe was inserted through your penis
They shaved me and they didn't even ask.
Hmm
Mishra uncle,
Most importantly , Vijay
then find me a donor.
Mr. Vijay, your name has been approved for the donor list.
But Finding a donor is not an easy task
A lot of things have to go right for this to work.
Unfortunately the success rate  is only one percent.
Papa, I'm going to be okay.
Gitanjali...
I have confidence in myself,
I will be fine.
Excuse me,
Who are you?
I'm a psychologist
This is the one thing working properly right now
We don't need you.  You may leave
You are young, married.
It's okay, it's okay.
Ther are my cousins and my family
You can start
The evaluation begins  with your sex life.
Go for it
Okay.
How often were you intimate with your wife?
Be specific
Sorry?
I am sorry we are not supposed  to answer these questions.
I'm asking because comparisons give us a point of reference, right?
I'm making your job easy
Sir, my job is to ask questions.  not give answers.
Could you just tell me?
Right, Gitanjali?
See, I managed to lighten everyone's mood.
Yeah.
Papa?
No, Reet.
I'm using this office these days
What happened?
Papa is busy with my doctors.
Tell me what's wrong.
I want to talk to Papa, I'll wait.
I killed Varun.
Reet, Varun was directly involve
in the assassination attempt on our father.
Order the bigger ones
They only come in one size
Tell Sheela to get some towels.
Where's his body?
Got rid of it.
You are a strong, independent  beautiful woman, Reet.
You should be happy that both your kids take after you.
dominant genes.
You can remarry.
I'll find you a good husband this time.
Reet, you fell for the wrong guy.
Look at Gitanjali.
Varun's father was a scamster too.
Doctors said his body's pumped full of chemicals
You know what the saddest part is, Reet?
You shared your love with a criminal.
So what if Varun is dead?
If he's dead, he's dead.
Disorientated?
I don't believe in wearing one
You drink?
No, son,
What are you saying?
Abstain means abstain.
You should embrace the concept of mortality.
Your time on Earth is coming  to an end.
surpasses all these things?
If I continue to live,
will you give up your vows of abstinence?
Write down Swamiji's address
and inform your well-wishers to visit him.
his life is supposed to be coming to an end
[Chants]
After all these years,
[Chants]
Jesus is our hope.
Jesus is our light.
Jesus is our light.
Jesus is our forgiveness.
Jesus is our forgiveness.
- Amen. -Where's Papa?
If they find out, they'll take  your name off the heart donor list.
They'll take my name off the list?
It's a church!
Brother, now that you are here,
He is very powerful.
Just meet him once.  I'll go ask him for you.
You have murdered more  than hundreds of people.
That is not murder,
You think I'll keep quiet?
We had our first kiss.
We had our first sex.
We still haven't had our first slap.
No one has ever slapped you, right?
Really?
What is this?
Listen to it.
I love you.
I love you.
They came to service the flight.
Retrieved the sound from the black box.
Our first night together.
I'll shoot them.
Brother, Father is ready.
What went down, Brother?
I went to talk to him.
Yeah, it's a procedure.
Yeah so, I didn't know  that was the procedure.
He thinks Swastik Steel's logo  is the same as Hitler's logo.
Swastika Steel's logo is straight.
Ours is straight.
The Nazi logo is slanted.
Where's Manjot?
He's offering water to Father
Your brother, he is a sinner.
There is no redemption  for what he has done.
What are you saying, Father?
I declare it today,
he is a destructive force.
Stop irritating me. Gitanjali.
Do. Not Crush.
My Cigarettes.
- Happy birthday, my child. - Thanks, Nana.
What is going on?
What's there to think about, Amma?
Look at his state.
Nana, keep the newspaper down.
So stuck up on our inter-cast marriage.
And suddenly you have this concern? Why?
We are concerned.
He helped me with the childbirths.
When they induced labour,
I had contractions but the cervix was not opening.
I needed so much blood because I lost so much blood.
like a nurse.
And you know the most important thing is?
Hi, son.
You really don't know anything.
Amma, he is like my gynaecologist.
He knows me in and out.
"He is my father, mother, brother.
Brother  -Hmm?
We are leaving
Whoever wants to go can go.  I won't yell at anyone.
Uncle asked us to go back.
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Did you bring them here?
Papa, you were 66 when you got shot
but I trusted you'll be alright  and you became alright.
You want to start mourning before I'm even dead?
First thing,
don't speak to me in this language, ever.
You don't value the doctors' reports and advice at all?
You know your heart can collapse any time now?
I would give you my heart,  if I could.
But it doesn't work like that!
Papa...
The trick is patience.
some twelfth graders beat me up in school?
You know why?
Not to the principal, not to Mom, not to you.
I'm waiting again, this time.
You should wait too
Someone will surely die for me
and I'll get a new heart  for the transplant.
Don't we?
There's still so much left.
No one's going anywhere.
Hmm?
Gitanjali!
Gitanjali!
You didn't tell her?
Use your words. I AM NOT DEAF!
Sheela come with me.
Eat.
Why?
You really thought just because I can't taste,
I could sense it from how thick it was.
Please give.
Next time you're pissed at me,
don't mess with the salt or pepper...
Just add some poison instead.
Story over.
Nothing.
No, she was definitely saying something.
And then when I came  you changed the topic.
We were just talking about Kartik.
I see.
It's hurting.
What nonsense are you saying?
Don't... Please.
You are excited to get married
Don't!
and you took a gun there.
When I heard that,
I thought your firing should never stop.
But now, I'm scared when I see you....
Take me to a place like Kashmir and we'll conquer it all,
I can't smell you.
Where trees speak in fragrant whispers untold,
Where the clouds dwell too,
And he is gaining weight like a pig!
Love and attention.
Don't bring up that topic again!
Don't start it again!
I don't believe in regrets!
Neither does your son.
And be lost in your embrace forever,
How do I stop myself, tell me again?
Like a fresh waterfall,
They might have got a donor.
We have a meeting in the evening. Mark, Mark, Mark...
I'll personally draw my own designs.
It's my touch.
Are you ordering for more guns?
So I have this local guy "Freddy"
You can get in touch with him,  he will co-ordinate everything.
In a marriage, there should be some fear,
she spoke some real big words.
One more thing.
a married man should never have a protruding belly.
It causes problems.
Gitanjali!
I took six bullet shots,
Think like you don't have this,
Now tell me,
if someone keeps trying to kill your father, what will you do?
Look at yourself.
You're thinking the same  that you'd fight back.
Like men have been fighting  for thousands of years!
What are you doing, Gitanjali?
Sadly it's a man's world.
Brother...
- What? - Brother...
so who do think you are! Out!
You are fighting ghosts in your head.
Do you even realise that?
I don't fight ghosts, I devour them!
You have gone mad
You have lost your mind.
Mom, Papa... Why are you guys fighting?
We were not fighting.
See, your mom used to work in America,
and now that we're back in India, she's bored.
She's jobless.
Now she wants to act.
She wants to become a Heroine.
Look at her Isn't she Pretty?
Yup.
We were only rehearsing our lines.
And Papa is a Director.
You are the Hero, Papa.
Abhay, go inside
Hey Gitanjali, say this:
You're a hero.
Say it right, with some conviction.
I already said it.
Hey Gitanjali, did I hurt you when I did this?
Yeah? Did you get...
You didn't hurt me at all.
Then say this. "You're a Hero."
"You're going to be fine."
You are a Superhero.
Happy now?
Get ready for the doctor's appointment in the evening.
Oh my cutie, don't play with my heart.
Oh my cutie, don't play with my heart.
Sister-in-law, you are joining us as
the third wite of my brother Abrar Haque
There are some things you already know,
such as he has been married twice before

but he isn't mute since birth.
One night,
Since then I am his translator.
and my brother Abrar.
Come.
Oh my cutie, don't play with my heart.
You are leaving, embarking on a journey and I'm getting crazy.
Oh my cutie, don't play with my heart
You are leaving, embarking on a journey and I'm getting crazy.
Don't play with my heart and don't trouble me by ignoring me.
Don't make me to follow you all the time and be nice to me.
Don't play with my heart and don't trouble me by ignoring me.
Don't make me to follow you all the time and be nice to me.
Oh my cutie, don't play with my heart.
Do you know why he's getting married?
She is pregnant."
She got to know yesterday
and they're getting married today
It's a good thing.
There is no guarantee of that.
why did you marry this guy?
What about you?
Congratulations on your wedding
Brother, Asrar was killed in Delhi.
Abid had told me not to tell you.
Women, please leave.
All men,
in the honour of my dead brother, Asrar
She is new here.
It took two nights to search for the body in Delhi
and three months to bring it here after freezing it.
It takes time to thaw the body.
Where are we going now?
Brother, you know what Asrar was like
He asked me to shut up
What can I do?
Killing Balbir was part of a fantastic plan.
This would have destroyed the man who built Swastik,
the company from where
our grandfather was thrown out like a dog.
You guys made a small thing into a big ego thing
and because of that screw-up,
my brother is dead.
Now you go and... apologise to my brother.
I understand, son.
You deserve to celebrate
Just get inside.
Brother, this is Zoya
That heart you got, it belongs to her fiancé.
Thank you for meeting me.
I just wanted to hear  this heart beat again.
Thank you.
Stop the car.
Listen, don't leave just yet.
Come.
Manjot...
Manjot, get her bags out
Take care of yourself.
Mohsin, where's that girl?
First floor. - That was Grandpa's office.
This is his house.
Son... who is that girl?
Grandpa, I'll be back in just two minutes, alright?
Give me your blessings.  Two minutes.
-I seek your blessings, Granduncle. - I seek your blessings.
God bless you.
Who is that girl?
Zoya.
When our eyes first intertwined,
When our eyes first intertwined,
Brother, Granduncle wants to know how much longer it's going to take?
Go and ask him.
I crave motivation,
How do I keep motivating myself, huh?
You want motivation, right?
Well then try exercising.
Try meditating.
I am very strong, Grandpa.  You don't know anything.
to black and white TVs, and then to colour TVs.
You've only experienced a few transitions and colours in life.
You can't even imagine how many
- Really? You have no idea what's happening
You should be happy I'm not doing drugs, at least.
Come on, Grandpa,  I can't tell you that.
You shameless punk!
Never!
What's right? What's wrong?
Your wife?
Yeah.
She is calling
Your scent, it's like a dream,
I want to lose myself  in it and be free.
I want to spend my days  being simply mesmerised by you
When our eyes first intertwined,
This is a 200-year-old British Club
and he has bloody booked it - to do the same stuff?
It's love, Brother.
And the rich guys tend to fall in love a couple of times, at least.
The only difference is that we have to pay for it
and he uses his expertise
He probably got touched by it or something.
Love?
In just one week?
Look over there,
The one he made himself.
We were also offering them breakfast that day.
Hmm.
Sangram, buddy, just let it go.
Seriously, stop it, Headman.
He's headed this way.
Yes, Brother.
Okay?
That's exactly what I was telling him.
Shut up
Sunny.
Enjoy the LOVE.
Paali!
Royal!
Call him up.
Busy 24/7, huh?
Call him right now.
You did not even dial once.
It's pretty late. She's probably asleep.
She's not answering either
Like I said, she's probably asleep.
Come, come. guys.
I want to order a Rolls Royce,
but I have a special request.
I want this colour.
It's okay. They are professionals.
I want exactly this colour.
Is it possible?
If there are any formalities. they'll sort it out.
take some photos in good lighting  and I'll arrange it.
Yes, sir.
Place the order
Sure, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Its Okay
When our eyes first intertwined
Zoya... look at this.
This sari is 200 years old.
Wear it today.
I called for the Maulavi (priest)..
We're getting married today.
And forget about this.
Just forget it.
I can't marry you,
and you shouldn't love me either.
I am your enemy.
The heart you got...
I lied to you.
Abrar Haque.
Where does he live?
Scotland.
What is his plan?
Abrar has a younger brother,
He is a professional butcher.
He stays in Istanbul.
When you murdered his brother...
He found out everything about you,
the family won't suspect a thing.
After that, when the time was right,
when you would've been with me...
He would've killed your father.
And while dying, Balbir Singh would've had just one question:
kill your wife, Gitanjali.
Murder your kids,
your grandfather, your mother,
they would see the face of the man
Your face.
he wouldn't have to kill you.
Tell me more.
And that explosion was meant to kill you.
I knew who you were from day one.
Die.
The way you love your father...
That's why I'm sure you can hate just as strongly.
But if it's possible...
please don't hate me.
Please.
Because I love you like crazy.
Really?
Come.
Come!
Treat her with respect.
We were three brothers.
My younger brother and I wanted to conquer the world.
But after a while,
his intentions turned sour.
Because of all that disgrace,
A few years later, I heard he set himself
on fire and died.
When Balbir took over Swastik,
You mean Abrar Haque's father?
Yes.
No Father, he didn't come for help.
He came demanding his share in Swastik,
If he came to me as a brother,
Abrar's father changed his religion
and got married a few times.
from different wives.
Abrar is his firstborn.
Do you know that?
If you go after him,
He's your cousin, just like them.
Forgive him.
This is not the time to forgive.
Listen son,
you took charge of everything with force and clarity.
It's a different matter, didn't like your ways back then,
nor do I like them now.
Forgive him, son.
You can forgive him.
Gitanjali?
Baby...
You've finally come home.
Come on, come with me.
I need to talk to you, Gitanjali.
Ihave been sleeping with Zoya  for the last few weeks.
Why am I doing all of this?
You got tired and passed out on the sofa while talking to her?
We were physically involved with each other.
You two were wrestling or something?
You are wrestling champions now.
What?
Yes.
Then just say you had sex with her!
Say that you had sex with her!
Kids are sleeping, Gitanjali.
Now you are fucking worried about the kids!
Fucking stay away from us!
Gitanjali... - Don't touch me.
Okay.
She was a mole.
so I could know their plan.
Don't just stand there like a dumb Animal!
Yes.
Yes.
You said you couldn't taste  or smell anything,
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Whatever I did Gitanjali,  I did it for my father.
I don't give a fuck about your father!
Don't go there, Gitanjali.
You must have had a very good time with her, right?
I have seen the girl.
She is a very pretty girl.
She too has a big pelvis.
Let go!
Don't touch me.
Answer me, did you wear a condom?
Did you do this in the US also?
With those women in your office - Catherine and Valentina?
Tell me something,
did you cuddle with her after sex like you do with me?
I saw "Sister-in-law 2" on his phone.
So basically,
you fuck anyone you want
and she becomes their sister-in-law.
Sure as hell, your father's status
Shut the fuck up!
their father's new love story!
Fine,
now go kill her.
I can't do that.
Why?
Why weren't you with me?
I wanted to come to you with clear conscious.
Oh shit.
How many times did you do  it with her?
Is she better than me?
I'll never be able to forget this.
I'll sleep with someone  and come to you
and say sorry,
You won't be able to do it, Gitanjali.
For sure, I'll do it.
And what's this "I break your toe,  you break my toe" nonsense?
Gitanjali, you forgave me  for so many murders,
but you cannot forgive me for sleeping with one woman?
No, I can't.
I cannot stay with you anymore.
I need a divorce.
Divorce is not a solution.
I need a divorce.
I'll give you one free advice,
As long as your father is alive,
Whenever your father came home,
you would run away from school,  even forgetting your bag.
You'd get punished by teachers.
On his birthday,
you'd distribute chocolates like a maniac.
Your love for your father
What did you say?
I wish he had died that day.
End it.
Shoot.
And that makes a full moon,
A star shines bright for me, another for you,
While the rest of the sky remains dark,
This love is the rainbow  in the discolour,
While I'm an ascetic and this love is the holy river,
What happened?
What happened, Papa?
Don't bring the gun to your room.
I won't do it again.
Mom, we'll talk about this later, okay?
Gitanjali, you okay?
Yes, Uncle.
Mom...
Let's go, Jyoti.
This once you don't stay,  and it won't upset me,
If I could not be yours,  I could neither be my own,
I would never, ever come to your city,
The vows that we've taken around the fire, keep burning within,
This love intoxicates every vein  in my body,
Why is this love only coloured with blood?
Let go of all my memories  in the flowing waters,
Abrar!
Abrar!
Jitta!
Oi!
He is prepared and we are not.
All our guys are dead, and they're ready to go down.
What if you try to kill him  and we die instead?
that's been burning inside since we were kids?
Now you listen to me.
Abrar!
Look, I'm here.
Hey!
I seek your blessings. Grandma.
Where is Abrar?
If only you had told that to your grandson, Grandma,
Where is Abrar?
I don't know, son
How long are you brothers going to keep fighting for?
Looks like he ran away.
Brother!
Where's Abrar?
I'll only ask one more time,
Listen you fucking psycho,
- we don't know where Abrar is .Shh.
Where's Abrar?
We don't know where
We don't know where he is.
Oh, my God!
- Please. -You two have kids of your own, right?
My God!
Please, no.
Fifty miles from here.
- He is leaving the country. - No.
Please.
They aren't your sisters-in-law, they're the wives of our enemy.
Don't worry, we have called the ambulance.
Don't go!
Stop.
Whether I remain standing or fall down,
For this day I've longed to see,
For this day I've longed to see,
I want to be your side
I want to hold your hands,
I want to worship you day and night.
No tears will fall from your eyes,
No tears will fall from your eyes,
As long as I am alive,
I promise you'll be fine,
I'll obliterate all in my path,
My sanity will crumble as an aftermath,
If any harm comes your way.
If any harm comes your way,
Tears each day, they will ruin me,
-No tears will fall from your eyes, - Manjot, don't!
No tears will fall from your eyes,
As long as I am alive,
I promise you'll be fine,
I'll obliterate all in my path,
My sanity will crumble as an aftermath,
If any harm comes your way,
If any harm comes your way,
I realised...
I was alone.
You are my life, it's true.
You are my life, it's true.
What's going on?
Identical twins.
Grandpa said you are  my flesh and blood
If I stop,
will you also stop?
Tell me.
My brother can't talk!
Hey!
Brother, use sign language  to communicate.
I know sign language.
Tell me...
Tell me that you won't go  after my father.
Just say it.
Yes?
Will you stop?
The burden lifted, I feel so weightless and light,
The burden lifted, I feel so weightless and light,
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Gitanjali, what are you wearing?
We need to talk. I know.
You always wanted to go back to the US, right?
Pack your bags; we'll leave tomorrow.
We'll take Papa with us too.
Happy Diwali, Papa.
Happy Diwali, son.
All of us.
Papa, I've always wanted to spend time with you.
That's all I want in my life.
What is this?
Leukaemin , fourth stage
The doctors say I only have three to six months left.
Leukaemia is very common in America.
This is not something you can solve with a gun and violence.
I don't want a lecture  on practicality from you.
I said I don't want a lecture  on practicality from you.
It's because of me, my gun, and violence that we are still thriving
You can slit as many throats as you want and blame it on me.
I know,
This is good, Papa.
This is awesome
Stay resolute, Papa.
I won't waver either.
20 years ago, you told me that
Nothing has changed between us in these 20 years.
- Vijay! - Mom, you go outside.
Hey!
- Jyoti, come and sit here. - No, Mom,
- Come and sit here. - Mom, please.
I have got this chance after 36 years.
Leave.
Okay Papa, let's play a game.
Stay with me.
We can't go through my entire life since
you don't have much time left.
Which day?
Hmm...
Remember when I was in fifth grade
You knew what a big fan  I was of Michael Jackson.
But I didn't go because it was your birthday.
Papa, stay with me.
"Papa, where were you? Where were you?"
You don't have to do much
It's my only chance, okay?
Action, Papa
Papa...
Papa...
I want it immediately! Now!
- Papa, I...  Jyoti, take him inside.
The stock market has crashed.
Don't wipe your face, Papa.
Don't touch your face.
I didn't touch mine either.
You are doing well, Papa
You are doing well.
Continue
I come home after two weeks and he won't stop going, "Papa, Papa..."
- Papa, it's your birthday. -WHAT!
Papa, I kept waiting...
Do you want to achieve something in life
Papa, remember you even slapped me that day?
Remember?
But now you're playing along,  and I can't hit you back,
Yes!
Vijay!
Enough Vijay.
Enough, Vijay
Are you giving up so easily?
Papa you know you are the greatest for me.
I believe I am the greatest son  in the world.
Do you know why I love you so much?
There's no answer to that.
When you came back...
I was so happy
but you started a war.
If Varun had told me that Papa is safe,
and not done all this.
Swastik was my life.
I wanted to give you my empire,
and you just walked away,  just like that.
But couldn't you have reached out to me?
You had kids,
"I am your bastard son",
that's what you said!
I am your father!
and this is not a game!
What if I ask you all these question?
Forget it.
Where did I live in Virginia?
What was my designation?
Leave it, Papa.
Just like always, never letting me finish my thoughts.
Vijay
Vijay...
I made a mistake, my son.
Remember me however you want.
Vijay...
and I'll be your son.
So don't make the same stupid mistakes I made.
And in the life after that,
And you'll see how much I truly love you.
There is one star in my sky
-You are my whole world - Mishra uncle...
Father, my life, walk with me

Was she family, dear?
My grandma.
to make way for you.
Right?
Naia. Come on.
<i>Want some water?</i>
Where are you going, dad? I'm off, son.
I have to buy batteries.
Batteries?
Wait a minute, dad. Get your head straight. Please.
It's time for me to look after you.
No, but...
She agrees.
Your wife would certainly have agreed.
Dad, please don't start.
I'll take the bus.

As you wish.
Yeah.
Cleaning up shit at 90 years old.
Guess.
I'd better not.
It's probably Jorgito, or worse...
I'll tell you one day.
When you're old.
Being old's gross.
Nobody listens to you, they ignore you.
That's right.
I'll be shit scared.
Why?
Your grandad's not alone.
He's got you.
They've been preparing their whole lives. I won't be scared.
I don't care right now.
I won't be wrinkly for ages.
What?
We could die tomorrow.
Here.
They're charming.
Lena, please.
Naia.
Can you help Lena?
You said I just had to do my room.
Mario, this may seem stupid,
what if we don't know everything about your dad?
No.
The police said my mum committed suicide.
End of story.
You think your dad's okay?
No.
That's why I want to look after him here.
That's the baby's room.
It's a big house!
Are you okay? Yes.
Try to understand, Mario.
We can't make sacrifices.
and now your dad.
You have a job now.
Naia makes some money sometimes and I'll find something soon.
Find what?
You haven't installed an AC unit for four months.
People are broke.
Accept it.
Lena, my dad's always helped whenever he could.
So what?
Here we go...
I do understand.
But it can't happen.
What happened isn't our fault.
No... but he's my dad, Lena.
His wife just died.
My mum.
They were married for almost 50 years
He's my grandad, Lena.
Fine.
I'm the wicked witch in this story, right?
Do what you want.
I think I have keys for here.
<i>Dad?</i>
Dad?
<i>Dad?</i>
Dad?
Maybe he's out.
He's home.
Dad.
How are you? Here.
Let me help you.
And the rest?
What?
I'll help you, grandad.
Give that here.
Dad...
The wiring's pretty old
but there's a lamp on the desk.
Dad.
It's just temporary, you'll see.
<i>And lay it at your feet</i>
I'll help you, grandad.
<i>And turned it into song</i>
<i>And lay it at your feet</i>
How old was grandma here? Like me, or older?
I have a picture of mum too.

Yes, serve her.
Naia.
It's a country salad.
I'm not really hungry.
You'll waste away.
Put your phone away.
Enough? Yes.
Dad?
Your wife's food was good.
Dad.
Lena's my wife now.
Lena.

Why won't he let you into the flat?
It's really weird.

Hello.
Grandma?
I hear them.
Naia.
Are you okay?
Naia.
Dad.
<i>Grandad.</i>
Yes?
Do you know what our first argument was?
The Civil War had finished a few years earlier.
we were walking through the outskirts, near the Fuente del Berro
and we ran into Guerrita,
She was so beautiful.
And that bastard,
because he was a real bastard,
and said we couldn't pass without doing the fascist salute.
I knew that Guerrita was always armed
But your grandma...
Oh, your grandma.
Rosa stood up to him, challenging him,
like a beast about to pounce.
Guerrita laughed like a hyena.
And you know what?
Your grandma never forgave me for that laugh.
She took orders from nobody.
She never gave in.
She was unique.
Like you.
That's why she's gone.
I've told you that story more than once, haven't I?
Yes.
Lots of times?
Yes.
Thank you.
Naia.
What?
Nothing.
Let's head home, grandad. It's getting late.
You go.
Okay, but don't be too late, okay?

Fucking hell, dad.
Yes?
Is everything all right?
Excuse me?
Everything's fine, isn't it?
I don't really understand, I just came to...
get some of my dad's things.
Your mum says
don't forget to lock the door.
Your mum says
that you always forget to lock the door.
I took some photos.
It's all quite neat and tidy.
See?
Mario, please.
My dad keeps it clean, damn it.
Believe what you want.
Seriously.
There was nothing strange?
Old people's stuff.
Well, a weird neighbour gave me a fright.
A weird neighbour? Weird how?
What happened?
Hey. Is it really 12:30 a.m.?
Naia.
Where's grandad?
Naia!
What were you thinking, Naia?
Put your phone down. I'm asking a friend to help us.
Where are you going?
INCOMING CALL
Hello?
Hello?
<i>Dad?</i>
Dad?
<i>Dad?</i>
My grandma jumped from there.
Yeah.
It's dark inside.
Your grandad isn't there.
If anything's happened...
Come.
Hang on.
but he might know something.
Looking for something?
My grandad.
He's lost.
He's here.
What?
Here, in the back.
Where?
I HEAR THEM
Back here.
Look closer.
Grandad?
Can you hear them?
Get off me!
He's not up there.
What's wrong?
Let's go, please. I'll tell you later.
Let's call the police.
He could become dehydrated in this heat.
Your mum was right.
Lena's not my mum.
Grandad's old and sad, which is normal, right?
Why the fuck are you here?
He's my boyfriend.
Give me that.
I've dreamt this...
It's Lena.
Lena.
Dad.
It's me, Mario.
I'm here with Naia.
Where are you going?
Nice and easy, Manuel.
I'm almost done, okay?
<i>There's a rare strain of Alzheimer's</i>
that tends to appear after powerful emotional shocks.
It's called Pick's disease
and this type of illness can make things around the sufferer
seem a bit... strange.
as psychotic episodes,
and very rarely...
For the time being, I'll prescribe him some sedatives.
Strong ones, to put your minds at ease.
And... let's see how he reacts to the treatment.
None of that helps.
Okay?
Have him take this
and drink lots of water, that's important, okay?
Have you considered hospitalising him?
Hospitalise him where?
A nursing home, dad.
A retirement home, Mario.
115,34 ºF
117,32 ºF
What?
What?
So yesterday was nothing?
Who knows what he's up to.
That's not it.
<i>Can't we talk about it?</i>
And don't say it'll pass.
It's a downward spiral and he's taking us with him.
Something must be done.
Dad?
To Naia and to me? Or don't you care?
React. Do something.
I don't know. Anything.
Close your eyes.
Don't move.
Right. Lock him up in a home like a crazy person.
Let him rot and die there.
If he stays something will happen,
I'm scared!
Naia, what's wrong?
She jumped.
She jumped again!
Jota says this course has great prospects.
Gamers have prospects?
The guy from the other night?
Why Jota, anyway? Is his real name Jorgito?
Idiot.
Pass the potatoes.
No, go on.
Looks like it, but they've got no idea.
- You don't care. - Of course we do! Right, Mario?
Of course, tell us everything.
Grandad?
Sorry, dad. We didn't get that.
I'm going to kill you.
Tomorrow.
That's it!
Hang on a minute, wait.
What the hell are you saying, dad?
Grandad?
What's wrong? Get him out of here.
Get him out.
Let him die.
None of this will matter tomorrow.
I'm calling the police!
Hang on!
Wait!
You... come with me.
I told you!
<i>Hear me?</i>
<i>Let them talk, let's go.</i>
standing up for you is impossible.
All of this junk...
The rooftop...
What you said out there...
What's going on, dad?
Tell me, would you?
Tell me what you're doing.
Dad.
Dad, please...
What's going on with you, dad?
Now we can talk.
Okay.
I'm listening.
They've been watching us for quite some time.
With them? Who?
The voices.
They communicate with me in many ways.
Sometimes through the radio,
the magnetic waves.
And if I listen carefully,
I can hear them behind the mirror.
I see their shadows in the reflection.
In my dreams.
I'm not an idiot.
If you heard them, you'd understand too.
I can hear everything clearer now.
Now... I'm strong enough to do it.
Do what?
We have to do it ourselves.
If we don't work together, we'll all die.
This way, we have a chance.
I'm sorry.
But it's unavoidable, son.
Are you serious?
For God's sake, dad. Lena's about to call the police.
They spoke to your mum too.
But she...
never gave in to anybody.
Listen to me, dad. Please.
Please.
I'm sure that those voices
It's too late now.
That's enough!
Nobody's talking to you! Nobody's listening to you!
Understand?
Look!
Nothing's watching you.
It's just you. Look!
Look.
You.
This.
That's it. This room, this bed.
Life. That's all there is. That's it.
Dad...
You're leaving me no other option.
I've already lost mum, I don't want to lose you now.
They told me...
You know?
No, dad.
No...
Naia, wait for me!
<i>I'm sorry. We can't take Manuel yet.</i>
RETIREMENT HOME "PARADISE"
<i>Impossible.</i>
<i>or in a few weeks.</i>
Don't you understand, he's dangerous.
sometimes it's incontinence...
Disorientation...
Old age.
I told you, there's nothing wrong with him.
Try to use these days
to say goodbye.
Show him lots of love,
he'll appreciate it.
In the meantime,
I'll get him registered.
Okay?
We might not meet again, I'm retiring next week.
"Welcome to Paradise".
<i>Naia, wait.</i>
<i>Let's talk.</i>
What do you think?
Lower your voice, damn it.
We can visit whenever we want.
So you're giving in?
What's another death in the family? Like grandma.
Like mum!
You think I don't miss your mum?
Every day.
Every second of my fucking life.
I can't do anything.
Nothing.
Naia.
Naia.
<i>Jota, we have to do something.</i> Calm down. Listen.
Tonight? <i>Yes.</i>
Okay.
I've got an idea.
<i>Jota?</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>
Send me the location. I'll be right there.

Mario.
Hello?
Hello?
Sorry...
Are you okay?

Sometimes...

it falls off.
And then...
I feel stronger.
Forgive me.
Lately, my husband hasn't been feeling well.
Fucking old people.
Come on.
Come on.
You'll fall.

Let me see.
Manuel, let me go.
You're hurting me.
You're hurting me, let go!

You wouldn't want to lose it.
I'm not like Rosa. It won't work with me.

Fucking hell...

Kisses! Love you.
You kept it. Look in your pockets.
No, no. We lost it.
No. You lost it.
Listen, over there, where the line starts, there are plenty to fill out.
Hold this for me.
Yes.
You speak very good Catalan.
Intimidating, isn't it?
I'd said it's downright scary.
You're Latino, right?
Yes.
The form.
-Excuse me. Do you have a pen? -Yes, sure.
Thank you.
Fruit... no. Vegetables no.
Animals no.
10,000 euros in cash. No.
-Leave it blank. Yes, leave it blank. -Sorry.
Okay...
Family... two. Okay.
Finished!
All done. What were you saying?
Number 18, come on...
Hello, good morning. -Hello. Hi.
Passports please.
Passport sir, please.
Could you try that again? - Yeah.
Now your left hand.
Now your left thumb.
Alright. Look in the camera for me please.
Okay.
Now you miss, same thing. Right hand.
Alright, now you right thumb.
Now the other hand.
Now the thumb.
Follow me. - Is everything alright?
Please follow me.
Sorry, where are we going?
The secondary special.
We have to ask them what's going on.
Yeah.
-Let's do it? -Hang on.
Hello sir, sorry...
Is this going to take long?
We have a connecting flight to Miami.
Everybody has a connecting flight.
Right.
Sir! No phones here.
I'm sorry, no phones? OK.
Mr. Bucher, can you come here please?
Why are you traveling with so much luggage? I'm bringing presents for my family.
Shit, you were right. We should have had something to eat.
I'm always right.
Sorry... - Yep.
How long have you been waiting here?
About... three chapters - What?
Three hours.
Thank you.
We have an hour and a half.
-Hey. -What are you doing?
Are you alright?
Yes.
Mr. Hernandez, miss Pamies.
What's the purpose of your visit?
And did you fly straight from Spain? - Yes.
Yes. - That's all I ask.
Where?
Internet - Okay
Sorry, is there anywhere to get some food?
No.
-The less we complain, the better. -Why?
Well, if they piss me off, I can screw them over even more.
No, fuck. Just wait. We have to see the big picture.
Well, it's simple.
They check information. You have to wait here.
And that's that.
But if you make them uncomfortable...
Ma'am, sir, follow me.
Let's go.
Ma'am, sit down.
You, put your luggage on the table.
Can you open it? - Yes.
Who packed this suitcase?
Me. Well... us.
What is that? - Routine check.
Put it in the carry-on and lock it.
No, it's Miami.
Then why is someone waiting for you out here?
Sir, sit down.
Ma'am, can you bring yours.
You or both of you? - Me.
Read a lot?
What's this?
My medicine.
And this? - My insulin shots.
I'm diabetic.
What's he doing?
I'm freaking out.
Ma'am, cellphone.
Great.
And this?
Let me see.
Ma'am. Sit down.
Here. Here here.
Come on. Here.
Mr. Hernandez, can you step here please.
No. - Turn around please.
No.
Turn around.
Turn around please.
Come on.
Wait here, an officer will be with you shortly.
- This isn't normal, is it? - No.
Why are they searching us like this?
The lawyer said they might ask us more questions, but not fucking all this.
In my life!
No, but that was supposedly taken care of.
Do you think we're being filmed?
No.
I don't give a shit!
No.
Diego Hernandez?
Miss. Sit down.
So...
Diego Hernandez
Born July 14th 1981 in Venezuela?
Yes.
Pamies. Pamies Baseras?
Born in Spain. - Barcelona.
Yes.
Sorry, but we have a connecting flight.
We should be heading to the boarding gate right now.
We also have someone outside waiting for us.
Well, both.
I wouldn't worry about either one right now.
Can you hand me your medical exams?
Mr. Hernandez first. - Yes.
Now yours miss Pamies please.
I don't.
You got them?
Yes.
Social media accounts and user names.
Yes.
Yes.
As many times as necessary.
repeating everything again and again.
For your own interest, I recommend you answer the questions you're asked here.
Mr. Hernández, do you have another nationality?
No.
I have a residence permit as the partner of an EU member.
And that's all.
I applied for Spanish nationality.
-And did you receive an answer? -Not yet.
It's just that we had a deadline to come here.
Well, that I'll have to continue the process from here.
And you're his partner?
Yes.
- Elena Pàmies, born in Spain... - Pàmies.
- December 4, 1987. - In Barcelona.
- Correct? - Correct.
- Who was the winner? - Me.
- Sorry. Can I get some water? - And you applied as well?
Yes.
- But you didn't win. - No.
- Yes, for me yes. - Not for me.
Which years did you apply?
This year.
In 2012 and the first time in 2008, I think.
Third time is the charm.
No matter what.
Are you married?
- Exactly. - And why aren't you married?
Well... What for?
When did you sign your civil union?
- Two years ago. - That's right.
My aunt and uncle are. My brother isn't yet.
And you, Ms. Pàmies?
No, no one.
- You're a dancer? - Yes.
Where did you train?
In Brussels.
Three years.
Yes.
So, you are an urban planner?
That's right.
According to the data we have here, we gather that...
when this procedure was approved, you were unemployed.
Yes.
- And you? - No, no. I had a job.
Doing what?
- Teaching what? - Dance.
Where?
In Barcelona, at a dance school.
Who did you teach?
Children, young kids.
- Well... - To work.
Why not another European country, isn't it easier for you?
Well, we wanted to try somewhere outside of Europe.
And Canada?
32 and 38 years old isn't considered a young couple here.
indicating that you have a job offer or sponsor.
No.
No, but I'm meeting him next week.
I remind you that you are not officially in the United States yet.
Even though you won the Lottery Visa,
this interview has the last word.
What's your final destination city?
And after that?
No, the idea is to stay in Miami.
If Miami doesn't work out, we thought maybe New York or Philadelphia.
Or San Francisco...
Or San...
Yes.
Well, we're open to all options.
And why Miami?
Did you give me the document with your bank balance?
This is all you've got?
Yes.
Some other country?
No.
- A car? - No.
Nothing in your name?
We have a dog.
Not now.
For the United States?
Yes.
An extraordinary ability visa.
And what are these extraordinary abilities that you included in your application?
My professional career.
And why didn't you apply with yours?
Because we thought that his had a better chance.
Because we have new information.
When did you meet each other?
In Barcelona.
- When? - Three years ago.
Barcelona. Where?
At a party.
Yes.
How long before?
Six months.
Who proposed it?
No. We signed the papers.
Nothing else?
- Nothing else. - You're not religious?
- No. - No.
But we respect all religions.
And your parents approved of this union?
Yes, of course.
No, they couldn't come.
When the last time you entered the United States?
I think four years ago.
Yes.
But you've been for secondary inspection before, haven't you?
Yes.
It says here that you traveled with a stolen passport.
No. - Who did?
Actually... - This one.
Who reported it stolen? - Don't know.
This has been checked already.
But your Spanish accent sounds a little weird.
From many years being away.
Are you nervous?
A little.
This is making me nervous.
What's making you nervous?
Being questioned.
You know what makes me nervous?
Lady! I'm talking to Mr. Hernández.
Because the whole marriage thing just isn't for you, is it?
Yes, I think so.
But that doesn't change your love for your partner,
No, of course not.
You haven't been asked that before, have you?
Were you married to an American?
Yes, I'm sure I'm not married.
But even though you don't believe in marriage,
I was in a relationship
-and we got engaged. -What year was that?
Well... I don't remember.
You should remember. It wasn't that long ago.
It says here that visa was approved.
And why's that?
Because we ended the relationship.
Remind me... what was her name?
Kate Rodríguez.
Where does she live?
Back then she lived in Miami.
Where did you two meet?
Online.
How's that?
We could never coincide.
I didn't have a visa and she couldn't travel.
No.
How long did the relationship last?
About a year.
A year!
And you never saw each other?
Ah... seven months into it.
How old were you?
I don't remember.
What was your age difference?
Eight... Ten. Ten years.
And who was older, her or you?
Her.
Yes. I know.
No, that wasn't the case.
It says here this visa was approved
To Barcelona.
Could you answer something?
and this time you decided on an open union?
No.
No.
No.
No.
You?
No.
Do you have any family members who depend on you here or outside this country?
No.
give her a glass of water.
Mr. Hernandez, stay here.
Mr. Hernandez....
What is that?
He's waiting for us outside.
Why can't I answer my phone?
Yeah.
That's OK. - I need the phone.
Really? - Yes.
What are you doing with my phone? - Hiding something? - No but...
Password?
Verdi217.
Can you spell it?
e... r... d... i...
2-1-7.
That right?
No capital letters, no spaces?
That's good.
Yes, of course.
Right side.
Is she a jealous type?
No, not really.
Well, eh, maybe once.
Yeah? With who?
Frederica.
Frederica?
Is everything alright?
Just answer the questions. - Where would you like to retire?
Not really, no.
When was the last time you traveled together?
This summer.
Which countries did you visit this past year?
Ehm, Italy, France.
Berlin, Caracas.
When did you last visit Venezuela?
Ah... last year.
For how long? - A month.
Why?
It's fine.
Eh... visit family.
Anything else?
I renewed my passport.
You went all the way to Venezuela to renew your passport.
No.
Has she ever been?
No.
Why not?
It's not the best time to visit.
Yeah? Tell me about it.
You do know what's going on there.
It's become very violent and...
the political situation doesn't help either, so...
Why?
Do you think I have time to watch news from Venezuela?
So you got in trouble?
I got kidnapped.
When was that?
A year before I move.
I paid.
You bribed police officers?
How long did this last?
An entire day.
It's not that uncommon.
Now? No.
Yes.
where would that leave you?
Now.
Why would I break up with my partner?
I wanted to study there.
Where you already thinking about staying in Barcelona?
No, I had no idea that would happen.
When did you decide to stay and live in Barcelona?
Sorry?
I said when did you decide to stay and live in Barcelona?
Did you have any relationships prior to miss Pamies?
In Spain you mean?
Yes, yes I did.
My roommate.
Where was she from?
Kassel.
Where is that? - In Germany.
You have a taste for many nationalities.
How often do you have intercourse?
Excuse me?
You're serious?
Twice a week.
Yes.
Soon?
Yeah.
No, but not now?
Are you OK...
It'll be OK.
Do you trust your partner?
Yes, of course.
Yes.
Yes.
So she knew? - Yes.
She consciously knew about your previous engagement?
Yes.
Diego.
I know this is uncomfortable.
I know what you're doing.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
You think you're the first immigrant to come here with everything in place to stay?
My cousin did the same thing. He married a gringuita and...
But I'm not doing that.
Tell me the truth and we'll be done with this.
You don't get in, of course, but...
Tell me the truth.
I don't know for how long,
Say it!
"I'm with her for the papers".
And that's it.
I didn't do what your cousin did.
What?
- Are you judging my cousin? - No, no, it's just that...
They're different cases. They're separate cases.
Because you immigrated here with money.
Because you aren't one of the ones who cross over.
You're a... What do you call it?
A snob.
You know what? I prefer the ones who cross over. I have more respect for them.
Bring miss Pamies back in.
Miss Pamies, come on in.
How are you?
I need some sugar.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm a diabetic, I need sugar.
Now.
Yes.
Can't wait?
Go ahead.
And bring me your phone.
Okay.
Password?
1 - 8 - 1 - 1
Mike, eh... 1811
Can you tell me what's happening?
English please.
OK to that. - Alright.
Hey, guys!
Guys! Come on! - I'm on it.
Are you okay?
Let's move out.
Go to room three.
No, just leave your stuff there. It's fine.
No, it'll be fine.
Mike, three is ready right? - Yes.
Close that one for me. - Yes sir.
Do you wanna have children?
What?
It is.
Yes.
Soon?
Don't know.
Yes.
far away from your home.
the family, not a problem?
Yes.
And you're OK paying 600 dollars each...
There's no other way.
Yes.
No.
You mean sex? - Yes.
Depends on the season.
No.
How come?
But what?
The political situation, right?
Yes.
How do you know everything he's told you is true?
I met his parents.
That long?
How did you get along? - Fine. Fine.
Mhm.
They ever thought of leaving the country?
It's a possibility.
Where to?
Do they if he doesn't live there anymore?
Why not?
That would take forever.
You close with your family?
Yes.
Yes.
What's the point of this question?
See if you're being honest with us.
And my dad doesn't really care.
What she didn't like is that he was from Latin America.
How does that make you feel?
I mean...
I understand my mum. She was raised in different times.
That's not racism.
Three times... per week.
That's about 140, 150 times a year?
So, what do you give them, 10, 20 years tops?
And if you can travel every year...
Miss Pamies...
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Ever affect your relationship?
No.
No?
Why would it?
No, yeah distance could be a problem sometimes.
Old friends, Frederica, that sort of thing.
Do you still trust each other?
Yes.
Did you know he was engaged to this other woman here?
No.
He was finishing his masters.
In modern urbanism, right?
Correct. - And you met that year?
Yes.
No.
How did he support himself?
He worked part-time in my uncle's clothing factory.
In a flat.
In your apartment?
So he not only got a job, he got a place to stay.
That's not bad.
Around that time.
March, 2018.
It wasn't the main reason.
But it was one of the reasons. -Yes so.
We could continue together.
Like what his American fiancé did for him.
No!
Yes.
What kind? - Contemporary.
Contemporary. You studied for that?
Yes.
Show us a move.
Here? - Yeah.
I'd rather not. I can show you a video if you give me back my phone.
What?
No.
I'm sorry? - No.
I'd do it if I were you.
I won't do it.
You won't?
You understand what I'm saying, right? - Yes. Yes.
You wanna get in or not?
Sit down.
because you won the Lottery Visa.
because you're his only way out.
Kate Rodriguez? - He was dating both of you at the same time.
I guess you're the lucky one because he chose you.
I'm sure this is not the first time someone tells you this, is it?
and not be questioned about it. - Listen...
Did you actually need, for you, to sign those civil union papers?
Think about it miss Pamies.
Please stop! - Who's idea was it to apply?
For the Lottery Visa.
It was his.
Did you even think of coming to the States before you met Diego?
No.
Miss Pamies...
You're the sole winner of his Lottery Visa.
Just you.
Not now.
Even before me.
You wanted a change of scenery because...
And the situation in Spain was going nowhere, right?
I've put a lot of effort into this.
My life has revolved around you.
that relationship was never important to me.
You know they asked me if I knew you had been engaged?
The truth.
That I had no fucking idea.
Did they ask you too?
The truth.
Sorry, the toilet please.
Please take her.
Thank you.
Welcome to the United States.
-Yes, sweetie! -I’m going to miss you so much!
I’ll see you every ten days, alright?
Wow!
Daddy…
Woah… flying elephants…
Argh… Why couldn't I catch this salamander…?
It was my fault.
Please allow me… to take care of An.
Please stay with An in the meantime.
She’s terrified and unstable.
Sweetheart.
Sweetie.
From now on, I will deliver more regularly.
COLD STORAGE
Anyway, where is An?
<i>Daddy, Ms. Tam taught me</i> <i>to write three pages of paper.</i>
Play with me.
-Hello, Ms. Tam. -Good morning.
Hello, sweetheart.
Come and play with me.
-No need to worry. -Thank you!
Jeez, missing a punch like that!
Hey An, Daddy's here.
I’m right here.
I thought you changed the route.
-Have you seen the girl in this photo? -I don’t know!
Oh… I know your father.
So…
let me help you find him.
Okay… let's go!
Go away, I don’t know your daughter.
She was here.
Mr. Bang?
Mr. Bang?
Mr. Bang, please let me in.
Leave it there.
Here.
You knew she was here.
Because you left her there.
Just follow that girl.
I'll deal with your later.
Sir, please buy some bread.
I gave you the big doll last time,
Aren't they pretty?
They're a pair now.
Go play with your dolls.
Sweetie…
Sweetie…
Sweetie…
Sweetie…
Come here, my little baby!
Sweetie…
I have no parents.
I'm sorry.
I live with my blind grandma.
Hey, wake up!
Damn it!
Who the hell are you?
You lost two dolls, remember?
I'm not playing dolls.
Who are you?
I'm her father.
She's not your child.
Hey listen, I've got loads of money.
You're going to regret this.
My family is an ant colony.
You can’t kill us all.
Boss!
then neither can you.
Find him!
Yes, sir.
Tell me the truth.
I didn't do anything.
Hey…
I need some help… hey…
Hey…
Couldn't jump-start the truck, and the battery was almost dead.
Let me take a look.
Hey…
Hey…
Hey… here.
I'm Bao Vi. I just changed to this route.
Here, some money for the hose.
Not for the help.
You don't have to pay me.
LONG PHUONG
Hey!
Son.
Gigantic Son. I'm in here.
Dumbasses!
You've got some guts laying your hand on the boss' son.
Idiot!
Bunch of shitheads!
If I die, my father will massacre your family.
I can wait till you bleed out… and get rid of your body.
You idiot,
I'm the one who's bleeding to death, not him
Slutty Long, leave it to me.
If you keep scorching them, they will crawl out.
All over your face, your ears.
Take one more step and fall off the cliff…
I'll spare you.
Come on!
Come on! Come here!
Come on!
I like this feeling.
Come on!
Damn it!
I will do everything you request.
Please help me.
Make him whole again!
Boss, he is an ex-task force member
You are nothing but a pile of flesh.
Why take his kid?
Also, it is for Mr. Thai's amusement.
Slutty Long, you're wrong.
Come on! Move!
Meow, meow… Wake up, sweetheart.
The doctor said An's condition is improving.
She still hasn't talked to anyone, though.
Hung, why did you say that?
Hung!
She needs you.
Please don't do anything reckless.
They must pay for what they've done.
Tell me again,
how did she get away?
Boss,
she had a fever and suffered a seizure.
If a part of the railway is stolen,
the train will overturn regardless of the length.
You let a piece of him live.
He will find you.
I'll finish him.
Making money,
tons of money.
Money can't speak for itself.
You ran in here…
Avoid being crushed under my wheels.
Confirmed.
Well! Loan-The Winner, such a joke, still a loser!
Sometimes the music reveals what the musician has been hiding.
The better the musician,
the more emotions he shows.
Your grandfather once said,
"Money is a cure."
but you only have one life.
You're my only child.
And he is still out there somewhere.
Ah… presents.
Here you are. Be good.
Having fun with the girls?
You really are something
Let me guess…

Like father, like daughter,
MS. TAM
END CALL
<i>You'll be treated nicely this time.</i>
<i>And your daughter's life</i> <i>will depend on you.</i>
Bastard!
Finally, I have the chance to see you face to face.
And you… won't be seeing your daughter.
If you can get through these piles of flesh.
I will let you reunite with your daughter unconditionally.
Any last words?
Let my daughter go.
There's no such thing in the agreement.
Stop!
An…
I kept my word and allowed you to reunite.
But I'm not sure my boss wants to stop here.
You coming at us won't end well.
Are you at full capacity yet?
How many can we still harvest eggs from?
We've been working nonstop.
Take all the eggs,
the market price is at all-time high.
Crying like that is not very nice.
Move!
Shut up.
Hurry up!
Hurry!
Move!
The boss ordered us to speed up the shipments.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Thai has arrived safely, sir.
It was me who took your daughter. So what?
You're good at diving, but you can't hide for too long.
She was screaming and crying.
Get out of the water and fight me.
You can kill me instead and let him go.
You gave him the whole world.
Please fall back, sir.
I will bring him down.
He wants me.
Open all the gates.
{\an8}YOU CAN CHECK THESE FIVE LOCATIONS
He must have choked on water.
I miss him,
he will always be my little boy.
<i>Save me, Father!</i>
When he was small and crying,
I like that feeling.
Whoever made him cry.
I hate them the most.
I want to ask you something.
I only hunt.
If you're not crazy enough
to accept my fortune,
that is another record.
I have to finish this once and for all.
I don't need any records.
He's guilty of multiple charges.
Justice will take its course.
Daddy!

The Old's Golf Club Radio.
but it's gonna be a tee-riffic weekend
at the Complete and Putter Madness Golf Tournament.
No, if, and-
- Why doesn't he just move?
- No, stop.
- Sorry about that.
- Sometimes these old things get stuck.
Usually not a problem,
usually not pointing right in someones face.
- Just turn that fucking thing off.
I just-
- Sorry. Sorry about that.
As I was saying, I just came down to say
what an amazing job you're doing with the course.
- Well, thanks Mr. Landon.
- This weekend is a very important weekend for me
and the club, and I couldn't be happier with the greens.
You may be one of the biggest pieces of worthless shit
- That fertilizer?
That I just drank a half a gallon of?
- Nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus,
- Micronutrients, dechlorinate acid,
tetracycline acid, bleach, ammonia.
And of course my secret family additives.
- Which are?
- Well, sir, if I told you that,
with all due respect I'd have to kill you.
- Yes.
And this is safe for people?
- I mean, sure.
- Yeah.
What about the animals?
- Probably not.
- Oh well, fuck 'em.
As long as my big money friends are safe
to knock around some balls, that's all I care about.
- Oh no.
Oh no.
Not on my good weekend.
- What you doing, Googie?
- Reading.
- Reading?
- Yeah, why you reading?
Trying to transform words into pictures in your brain?
- I don't know. I just like reading.
- You like reading.
- Oh, you like reading, huh?
- Yeah.
- Well, we got something for you to read.
- Yeah, read this.
It's called You, Me and Everyone.
I think it may help you with some of the social anxiety
- Changed my life.
I think I'd still be in the closet without this.
- You're gay, Smitty?
- Oh, I wish.
I was actually trapped in the closet.
Luckily I found this book,
Saved my life.
- Something happened on hole 15?
- It's Gordy?
What, what happened to Gordy?
- You're shitting me, hole boy.
- For the love of all that's worth my time,
what happened here?
- Looks like one of your employees
What happened to my beautiful landscaping here?
I have the biggest tournament of the season this weekend,
and you are putting chalk lines on my greens.
- Sir, please listen to me.
My hat says police.
Sir.
Sir.
Do you know what will happen if my members see this?
You think they wanna think about death here
If they wanted to think about death
they'd stay at home with their wives.
They come here to forget about death.
You wanna drive an ambulance on my golf course?
- That's what I said, didn't I?
- On my greens?
Two days before the biggest event of the year?
killed an unarmed 10 year old kid,
need to not go to jail money.
- This is why I have money
I have ideas, thoughts.
The best thoughts.
If you had half the thoughts I had in one night,
Watch and learn.
Watch and learn, stupid.
- Ugh, gross. You liquified him.
- Take your place upon the wall
of heroes that have fallen before you.
Sleep now, you prince amongst princes.
You tiptoed your way into our lives,
but only for a moment you stayed.
have had upon our hearts.
- I'm gonna miss that guy.
The shine.
- The whitest.
and I know you guys would say the same
without shame or envy, I'd want to have his balls.
- Staring into his balls
was like staring into the balls of God.
No one could do to balls what he did to balls.
- You would just take his fingertips,
starting at the base of the ball,
Damn, hole boy.
You motherfucker.
Now let's get out there
he put a lot into my little hands.
He ran this golf club for 35 years,
to the greatest golf club in the tri-state area.
Now it's my turn to take the wheel,
Complete and Putter Madness Golf Tournament
and I've been running it for four years now.
It's been the biggest, the biggest golf tournament,
Everybody knows I'm the best golf club owner,
I stop getting the money,
the power,
Is that what you want?
- I'm just a groundskeeper.
- No.
You understand?
- No, not really.
- I understand, sir.
- I can't have these caddies ruining my big day.
- No. No.
They're wild.
No, no, no.
You've done all you can to prevent this type of situation.
Yes, yes.
You just relax.
Let me, Miss Flannager,
with skin so soft and smelling of fresh linen.
Yes, and the shoulders of a strong, independent woman.
I don't need no man!
Get away from me!
- Can I go?
someone who won't take any cuff from those little shitheads.
My niece Becky.
But she's family.
I see no better person for the job.
You're gonna spy for me.
I mean, you're gonna manage for me.
Oh, manage them real good for me.
Solve all my problems.
You're so sexy and beautiful.
Is she the most beautiful female specimen
you've ever seen?
- Damn fine, sir.
Yes.
- If I could still get a male erection,
you know, I'd have one right now.
- Don't worry.
until they all do my bidding one by one.
Believe you me.
- Oh, I do.
Can't stop now.
This always reminds me of Vietnam!
My platoon, they're pinned down.
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
I'll save you, guys. I'll get you out.
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
Oh, we're gonna get out boys.
I make sure, we'll get you there.
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
Need the gas!
Oh.
Hello there.
You're such a cutie.
Oh no!
How is it possible?
No, stop. Please.
What the fuck?
- Remember me? Wacky Willy.
We're 20 minutes into the movie, here's another song.
- No,
- Okay guys, settle down.
Okay guys, I have a pretty important announcement to make.
- My boombox!
Whoa, whoa, time out.
Boobies.
Hubba hubba.
- Okay, fellas.
What are the three ups of caddying?
- Show up.
Sheep up and shut up.
Fellas, I'd like you to meet Becky.
She's our new caddy manager.
- What? A new manager, gimme a break.
- I'm not gonna let this beaver boss me around.
What about Mr. Bobbi?
He's the best damned caddy manager I've ever worked with.
Yes.
- I thought he was just mad at us.
- All right, that's not what's important.
and things are gonna change.
- Like how?
- Like, like no gum.
You guys can't chew gum.
- Nobody's chewing gum.
You see how great I am?
- You are amazing.
Yes.
- Now, which one of you pube holes
wants to show me around
and fill me in on your day to day around here?
- I'll fill you in, baby.
They call me fingers.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll find out.
Oh God, my fingering fingers.
Now I'm gonna ask again, who wants to show me around?
You, what's your name?
- Googie.
- Well, Googie, it looks like you've been elected.
Now get your bony ass up and let's do this.
doing whatever it is you pecker pinchers do around here.
- You're all in trouble now, yes.
Yes they are.
- Thanks a lot guys.
You suck, bony ass!
- Who likes reading now?
- No.
What are you doing?
Don't even think about it.
It's not for you.
It's for the gophers.
He's gonna take the sandwich.
We're going to code red.
Be on alert, I repeat, be on alert.
Oh, that's it.
Abort, abort.
Drop the sandwich, son.
You take another bite and I'll slit your throat
and I'll remove that tasty morsel
Comprende?
Go ahead, take another bite.
See if I'm playing.
Now, get the hell outta here.
- Mission accomplished.
one that gets overlooked a lot.
We're a good golfer's number one tool.
- Could a golf cart calculate the yardage on the next pin?
Could it tell 'em what club to use on the next shot?
Could it clean and locate their balls?
more than anything else, we ...
A caddy is a golfer's best friend and confidant.
- You're kind of a loser around here.
- I don't think so.
- No, I can tell these things.
Same way a dog can smell when a woman's on her period.
- Is that a thing?
I think the guys are pretty cool dudes.
- Championship caddies?
- Yeah, there's a special ranking system for caddies.
You think I didn't know
How could I be the caddy manager
if I don't know this stuff, huh?
I just thought you wanted to know.
- I didn't go to Caddy Management College
- Sorry.
- Yeah.
- You think I didn't go to caddy management college?
Do you think I'm lying about that?
- I didn't even know such a thing existed.
- There is a thing and I went there.
- Okay.
- I did.
- Okay.
He's onto us.
No, he's not.
He knows you're a fake.
At any cost.
Now I'm gonna spray you with some of this stuff
and nothing's gonna happen.
You got nothing.
That other gopher was just a fluke.
My patented fertilizer does not turn you fuzzy,
Do we have an agreement?
my fertilizer does not do the above,
I will let you go and we'll forget all about this
Here we go.
Oh, just in case this does turn you
into a mutated killing machine ...
but just in case, I'm sorry.
And please try to remember my compassion.
Thank you.
You're okay!
You're okay!
See, it wasn't my formula.
No, wait.
Don't do that.
You got, you had me. You had me.
Oh shit, you're not kidding.
What are you gonna do, Hambone?
Who knows how many of these creatures
Wait, Mr. Landon.
He'll know what to do.
This is unacceptable.
You mean to tell me that if these gophers
ingest your formula,
- That seems to be the case.
My course?
- Other than this one, I've only seen one other.
And we're sure this thing is dangerous?
- One attacked me on the green, sir?
- I'm 50% certain,
but there's only a 30% chance that that's right.
- 50% certain?
these little flea bags can be.
Flannager!
- Yes sir?
- That trap right there, sir?
Well, is it safe, sir?
- Safe? Of course it's safe.
Would I lie to you?
- Oh, well there was that one time, sir.
- And I found a cream to fix it.
No harm, no foul.
- You're right there, sir.
Now stick your hand in there.
- Sorry, sir.
It's totally my bad, sir.
- I can't let these gophers ruin my tournament.
of the richest, mediocre golfers their entry fees.
I already spent half of it
This problem has to be solved before it gets out of hand.
Our mission
is to rally the caddies
and have them round up all these godforsaken things.
- Should I inform the troops of the entire situation?
- Hell no.
As far as they know,
they're gonna be collecting your average,
cute and cuddly, fun-loving, run of the mill gophers.
Deadly force?
as far as I care.
- As you know, I am disciplined.
trained and proficient in all of my warrior tasks.
- God speed, Hambone.
God speed.
- Goddammit.
- You just gotta relax and keep calm.
and your game's been preoccupied for the last three holes.
- I know I topped the drive.
- Just stay in the present.
back when I actually enjoyed some part of my life?
Focus on the pieces of the shots.
- Pieces of my shots?
Align your body.
Arm back.
All right, buddy.
and you think the mere presence of a woman
would throw off your precious golf game.
So if you're gonna be here,
You just have to relax and stay cool.
She might even be a good luck charm.
She's our new caddy manager.
She's been four years at Caddy College.
She probably knows more about golf than both of us.
- Caddy College?
What in tarnation is Caddy College.
- You think just because I don't have a stinky wiener
between my legs that I can't know anything about golf?
every other day of the week trying to ruin our fun?
- Cute how we try.
How we try?
- I do mind.
And I bet I could hit one of these ball things
- You think you could hit the drive better than me?
- You bet your old wrinkly balls I do.
- Feisty this one.
- Psst.
Becky, psst.
Psst.
- Look, I know this guy's an asshole
but he's one of the wealthiest club members.
but Mr. Landon won't be pleased if this guy complains.
- Fuck Mr. Landon.
- Dammit.
- Oh, what's the matter, girly?
Not as good as you thought you were, huh?
- You've got this, Becky.
Just concentrate on the ball.
Be one with the ball.
- Googie.
- Oh, my balls.
It's okay, nice shot.
- Best out of three.
- Not again!
- Do you Stan? Do you?
- I haven't heard you say that once this whole film.
- Any of you guys ever hear Stanny boy here
- No.
Are you saying I can't party hard?
- Yeah, that's exactly what the Biggles is saying.
You can't party hard, Stan.
And you certainly can't party harder than the Biggles.
and I can party harder than every one of you.
- Party harder than all of us?
You gotta be kidding, Stan.
- You gotta be kidding, Stan.
- Your mom's tit, Stan.
- Leave my mom outta this.
She's dead, you know?
- My condolences, Stan.
- You know that's probably why she laid there
We're gonna settle this like men.
- Quiet. Quiet!
We've got pressing matters to discuss.
- Okay.
But make it quick!
think you can just come in here
When this tournament's over, I'm gonna build a wall.
You're lucky you don't have any money.
Then finally, me and my friends,
will be free of nuisances like you.
Yeah, I'd like to see you get in here then.
Nobody gets a drop on Wells Landon.
Christ!
Hey, hey, hey. How you doing?
You know that stuff I was saying,
you don't think I meant any of it, do you?
Hey, we can talk about this. We can negotiate it.
that I'm gonna let you join my club.
No!
- Men, all this stuff you hear about caddies
to goof off and party hard
is a load of bullocky.
Caddies love to work.
A caddy must be alert at all times
if he expects to keep his job.
I got a whole speech to do here.
There will be no partying for you boys tonight,
We gotta stay late?
I worked really hard on it.
- Forget this, I got stuff to do.
- Be seated.
- Oh Jesus.
- Listen up, you no good bitch wipes.
until your mission is complete.
There comes a point in every caddy's life
Sure, we might hate our jobs.
Sure, we might go home and look in the mirror
to have just a bit of mercy and end our lives.
Sure, we may go home,
only to remember your dog died three years prior,
but that is not today.
- Yeah!
- We will return men.
One day when you're sitting in your favorite chair
and your grandkids ask you
what the greatest day of your life was,
it will be this day.
And they will look at you with pride
spewing out of their eyes like diarrhea.
Like diarrhea!
- Yeah!
- Make me proud boys! Make me proud!
- Yeah!
- Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.
Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.
- What's Hambone's damage, man?
I know, right? We should be by the pool
drinking a cold can of ...
Booze!
- Hold it!
So not cool.
- I'm really happy you showed that golfer up.
down there every time.
standing out there to judge.
We could have just walked to the balls.
- Yeah, that's good to know now.
- Me too.
My sperm holders, not so much,
but I had a really great time.
- I know you had to be forced
- I'm glad it was me too.
- Look, there's something I have to tell you.
- Why would you ask that?
- Would it help if I told you in song?
- Yo, keyboard guy,
lay me down something noice!
Balls deep, balls deep in love.
- Oh no, not Cliff.
- Wassup?
- Hey little gopher, nice guy.
Oh, oh my.
- I'm done.
because I have a pussy.
That's not it.
- Hambone.
- You crap folds wanna go to war?
Well, I've been to war
would last one day with the shit I've seen.
- Piss flaps.
It's played with this revolver
and this,
a single bullet.
load it into this death pistol,
spin the cylinder,
Okay, you cut fucking clit jackets, back up!
Let me outta here.
My horoscope was right.
I've been wasting my whole night
looking for some freaking gophers,
- Man, I'd rather be out there hunting beaver.
- Oh, speaking of beaver.
- There's no time for jokes.
It's the gophers.
while you're in here drinking your life away
the other caddies are out there being killed.
- Nice try tuts, like we're gonna fall for that.
It's the gophers.
I probably need one more side of this
to be fully committed to the idea
that there are mutated gophers
be of
some
assistance.
Glad I didn't die
- This is rectum shit.
- This is a special request coming out
Good luck getting that mutative gopher
- Yowzer.
- Shit, he wasn't lying.
I think we should-
- We wasn't talking to you pecker weed,
We was talking to her.
- Oh, song's over.
I guess we're ready.
- Yeah!
- Clear my browser history.
- No, you fucking look.
but I'm gonna need some serious dick after this tonight
- Oh yeah, man, stereotypes.
- Yass, queen, I'm your hole in one.
- what do you think?
- We outta beer, we gonna have to do something about that.
- It's dreadful, but I've got an idea.
Let's go.
- He might be on to us.
- These tip plugs took over our shack.
So this is my brother's room, he's a loser.
He's pretty much in there all day, all night
writing his blog about making bombs
and blowing up his school.
He's a real lost cause.
He's probably still a virgin.
- That sounds like a good setup to a joke
- He's probably masturbating
- Barry, I need your help.
- My help. You want my help?
but if they're helpful to your cause-
- You've read my blog?
- Yes.
And it seems like you have an idea
- You read my blog?
- Dammit, Barry, you freak ...
- Okay, time to go.
- So what are we blowing up?
- We'll never kill these scum wads.
We gotta rethink this.
Wait, I have an idea.
- I planted out all the bombs.
and press this button in.
- What needs to be done, bitch.
You got this Becky, just concentrate on the bomb.
- Fucking kiss me.
- Whoa, did you see that giant gopher explode?
Well, you know what that means.
W-W-W-Wacky Willie.
And if you didn't like the film,
see you in the sequel.
- Oh!
Tell me.
Just now, the news came from superior show
that the entertainment industry may face reform.
cooperate the deployment of the superior actively.
of the entertainment industry during the transition period.
The official words are enough.
Once entertainment industry is opened.

We'll help him place a bet,
but it cannot exceed 500 at a time.
If he loses,
It's okay.
If he wins,

Fourth Master,
You bastard!
Before, everyone speculated why Zhengyang Yan is missing.
It turns out that you killed Zhengyang Yan.
Now that the evidence is overwhelming,
That they would do like this for their own cause.
Qi Yang has been arrested.
Although Qi Yang may have confessed,
He was only honest about what he did,
to put the video in the ceremony?
Should not be Huasen.
But killing Zhengyang Yan
is just for upgrading Qi Yang instead.
Mu,
Is there anything in the disk
other than Qi Yang's voice
that is suspicious.
The recordings are fragmented.
Only know that Huasen group
All anonymous except
Qi Yang is an idiot.
Remember that his wife is our leverage
How can you be soft-hearted?
Why would I trust Qi Yang

Officer Zhang.
I believe him,
Thank you.
Okay.
You go first.
Waiter.
Sorry, wife.
I don't have further request right now,
Did Zuo,
Be careful,
There are some things you can't handle in here,
Zuo, I'm a good example for you.
You will find out who he is
but promise me
That whatever you do,
you must keep my wife and son safe.
Don't hurt family.
I promise you.
What happened?
I'm going to tell you
I'm Junzhe Zuo,
It's me, who put the dollars
It's me, who put the dollars
Pass to TICC, Feng.
Come here, officer Jiang.
Earlier today,
hold a press conference,
Xin Wu, the president of Huasen group,
secretly colluded with gangsters in Abi
to control the opening of the entertainment industry,
which is directly related to the previous two president.
We will do everything we can to cooperate the police
arrest and deport the criminals as soon as possible.
Go to hell!
Request support!
Fourth Master.
Feng.
Take it, Albert.
Good boy, Albert.
You shouldn't eat them either.
Furthermore, it defines your existence in the world.
Disobedience is real courage nowadays.
It's different. I'm not the system.
Good boy.
- Besides, we're late. - I told you I had plans.
Playing games with your silly friends?
Wait, Émile. What the hell?
Damn it! Émile!
Get in the car!
- Stop! - God damn!
- Calm down! - Don't touch me!
Bastards!
Stop!
Come back!
Let's go, Émile.
Drive!
- Strange times. - Strange times indeed.
- Stop it. Don't bother the others. - It's okay.
Mr. Marindaze.
Emile.
So... Lana is getting better.
We are confident that we can stabilize her condition.
This is the first good news. The others are...
The Reception Center South opens earlier than planned.
May of this year?
I contacted a colleague who found a school for Émile.
I always say that man is not sedentary.
That lifestyle will be our death. The center is an option.
These mutations...
In two years we have made lots of progress in understanding the disease.
The doctor is right.
- Rabies, plague, measles. - And Ebola? Diabetes?
- Flu? Nothing for that. - You heard what she said.
It doesn't compare to before your father brought her here.
Why are you so condescending? He's actually studying it.
I'm not condescending. The situation became dangerous.
René Char summed it up.
Want to see your mother?
You can see the outer part.
You need fresh air.
Émile...
Smile.
RECEPTION CENTER SOUTH
Absolutely gorgeous cottage!
Albert, bang!
So...
I want you to welcome him.
Want to say something?
Your name is Émile? Do your parents hate you?
Thanks, Victor, for the constructive comment.
- Were you expelled? - Nina!
It's strange you're showing up now. Did you cause trouble?
- No, my father moved for his job. - What do your parents do?
There, Nina.
Good job, Nina. Pretty embarrassing.
Last week we read Phaedra. Did you reach...
Nina, I hope this is relevant.
Émile... Don't be offended. You are new and I was curious.
My ADHD makes me say things bluntly.
My thoughts race and then I feel guilty.
Lightning.
So.
So, Phaedra. Last week we discussed the definition of catharsis.
- You're not cooking? - Cooking, serving...
In a place like this you have several jobs.
- Smells delicious. - Thanks.
- If it's well paid. - Very pragmatic.
It has its charm, except for that new concrete center.
- Yes, for the monsters. - That's right. Anyway...
Sure. Be right back.
No one serving?
There is nothing to fear.
Shit!
Damn it!
Fucking cottage!
Go to bed. It's late.
Damn it!
One two three...
Hello? Yes, it's me.
How? Wait.
I don't understand. What happened? When?
Where?
Keep driving.
- Hello! - Dad, what the hell?
- Stop! - Dad! Let me go!
Stop!
Police Assistant Julia Izquierdo. You are in good hands.
- What happened? - The bus ran off the road.
The storm knocked over a tree.
- Izquierdo! - I'm coming.
My colleague will take your information.
Okay, then go to bed. Good night.
Damn it!
I heard they caught one in town. There was police everywhere.
Hello.
Yeah, droopy eyelids. Up with them!
Bigger steps. Knees higher.
- You don't toss a discus. - I do my best.
Everyone has an activity, Marindaze takes root. Find the mistake.
The mistake is Marindaze.
Wake up and show some enthusiasm. Get out of the way. People run there.
Pull! Harder! Come on, girls!
- Move it, Nina! - Harder!
Weak. Flex your muscles!
Now what?
Guys, help your friend out.
There! Excellent!
- You suck. - Idiot.
And Mokhtari will be happy. Right, Mokhtari?
I have to go.
What the hell is that?
Émile, it's Dad. I'm working tonight but I made lasagna.
And you're opening a steakhouse?
- Hasn't anyone updated you? - No.
- Why not? - I asked the same thing.
I expected to work around the clock, but they're sending in the military.
I'm a good team player, but that pisses me off after training all year.
So... "Honor and Fatherland!"
Got it. We're in place with Izquierdo.
The task force. What happened?
Secure the entrance and clear the store.
Guys, we...
- Lana! - Stop. Did you hear?
Stop!
We wish to inform you of an ongoing police operation.
Please proceed to checkout. Thank you.
Please evacuate. We'll take care of it.
What is this really for?
Camping.
Sure.
Yeah.
Police Assistant!
Julia.
François.
Bonnell, in the car.
Wake up. It stinks in here.
- Didn't you hear the alarm? - Don't, Dad!
- Get out! - Damn, it stinks!
- Hurry up. I want to talk. - I'm coming.
Sit down.
- Are you hanging clothes in the bushes again? - There are survivors. I saw one.
We triangulate from here and search west, away from the river.
Trust me. We'll find her.
I got it.
Cool, right? We often have parties here.
Jordan's parents are rich and never home. Here.
Circular movements are difficult.
You can't move freely in the armor.
- This one's cool! - For St. John's Day...
- Should I fight a duel. - Really cool.
Careful. It's delicate.
- What's the midsummer festival about? - A traditional party with sausages.
It'll get canceled because of the creatures anyway.
I saw one yesterday.
After school, not far from city hall.
Things came out of her mouth, like an insect.
- Jordan's mother. - She looked at me.
I swear. Her eyes were full of hatred.
I believe you but I want facts.
- Okay, Émile? - Is everything alright?
- Unbelievable! - What a horny fuck!
What was that?
- Put it down. - Who wants to hack a creep?
- Shut up. They're living beings like us. - Stop preaching. I'll impale you.
CREEPS NOT WELCOME!
What is that?
What the hell is that?
Hurry up. We're leaving in ten minutes.
Find her, Albert.
Come on.
Dad, how did you feel when Mom started to change?
You know the quote by René Char?
Weren't you disgusted?
No, it was just different. We confronted it together.
She was still herself. Nothing changed.
I'm angry because you butcher verbs and eat mass-produced salami.
You bought it.
Lana!
Super discreet with the police here.
Damn it!
There.
Check the glove compartment.
CD 2000 and something.
I invited her to the town party.
- Wild. - Open the window. Let her hear it.
Louder!
Mom!
Damn it!
Albert!
Emile!
Get away!
Come on.
Run!
Dad, stop! Watch out where you drive!
- You're crazy. - Dad!
- Get in! - When you calm down.
Satisfied? Get in.
- A little accident. - My dog ​​bit me.
What happened here?
The creatures attacked the riding school. Total massacre.
A horse massacre rather.
Come back!
Park further away.
It's bleeding again. It's a serious wound.
He really got you. If he tries again...
...we will put him down.
The dog, not the child.
Hurry up, Laborde.
You need some air?
Rub yourself, Laborde.
You soundproofed the room?
The mood is going downhill.
- I probably need a change. - Like what?
A relocation.
Help with what? Everything is fine.
Breathe from your stomach when you're feeling stressed.
Ok. Let's go.
See you.
Dirty flesh.
You're alive. How nice.
I called you. We were worried. Not that you care.
- What is that? - Let go! Ask before you touch someone!
Mokhtari and friend!
- This cathode is hydrogen, right? - Yeah.
What does voltage measure? That one?
Shut up!
I behaved the same way before I was diagnosed with ADHD.
Sorry for running away the other day. And for licking your arm.
It's different without silencer.
The music school wanted it back three years ago.
I can't decide. I want it all.
Here.
- Can I have something to drink? - Help yourself.
What is that?
I'm vegetarian. Dead birds aren't my thing.
I didn't ask for it. I don't encourage animal cruelty.
You smell good.
Maybe that's why.
- I stink. - I like it.
Damn!
Were you involved in the accident?
My mother was there, too.
And you?
- Fix. - Like in "to fix"?
Only the strong survive out here.
Thanks for the food.
She follows me. Get lost!
I can't fly? What do birds do that can't fly?
Do they live or die?
I know a safer place.
It's not far.
Great. A swamp. Should I impale myself?
That must hurt, right?
Your back.
Does it hurt you?
Look ahead. There is lots to do.
Almost done.
Damn!
Look.
I designed it. And we have this.
Originally it's for wild dogs. Nice, right?
"I like animals, from a distance."
It's from Gascon.
Who's there?
Lana?
Relax.
Lana!
Stop!
That's enough.
No!
Calm down and listen.
Look at me.
Let us be peaceful and reasonable.
Come now...
Go.
I should have tried something else.
A song, maybe.
My little sister calms down if you sing.
Far away. Hiding.
Yes.
Sorry I'm late. My bike was stolen. What happened?
It's not just in France.
It's an international network. Check the numbers.
The number of creatures increases. More and more, without end.
It's no use locking them up. We must live together.
Are you done eating?
Leave the forest to them. Like a big park.
Coexistence. We have to.
But there's no political will.
So what do you do besides printing T-Shirts?
Combat technique, so you're ready when you run into one.
Yeah, right. I'm easy prey.
Maybe I'll catch one and we'll be friends.
Then pitbulls are nothing if I have a Godzilla.
The police shut down donations after the incident at the restaurant.
Another sign of the school's low standard.
Never mind.
You're okay?
Come on, Fix!
- I'm almost there. - Yeah.
Those bastards sent me for corrective surgery.
It was a massacre.
How it changes? It gets blocked and it hurts.
For me it's the backbone. I feel the bones change.
Wolf fur is rough and itchy.
Dachshund you mean. Or poodle.
- No, wolf. - In any case, it's pathetic.
- You're one to speak. - I will be magnificent.
I will be magnificent!
The frog!
Calm down, François. It's just trees.
Julia!
This silence isn't normal.
Pesticides and monocultures.
- Empty, lifeless... - Turn off the light.
Okay, come on.
Hey, you okay?
Lana...
I don't know if I'm scared of losing her...
...or finding her.
Breathe.
Okay? Can you get up?
Grab the wrist and then...
Damn it.
Had a nice evening?
Not as nice as yours, it seems.
- Yours? - No.
What is it? You're being weird.
- And? - Try it. See if it works.
No.
I'm here.
How far has it gone?
Tell me and we'll get somewhere.
- That's it. - Does anyone else know?
- No. - Your girlfriend?
Watch your routines. Go to school.
The holidays start in two weeks, so be careful.
What's in that milkshake? Ew.
Mom's medicine?
Will you tie me to the bed, too?
What can we do?
They're really smart! Everything is based on coexistence.
The shepherd and the wolf in coexistence. It's not about chasing and being chased.
Or to create divisions. No. We must cooperate.
That for example. Don't do that.
I promise.
- Fortunately, your teeth are deep inside. - Fangs you mean.
Good. Cut them every day. As for the ears...
- Take off your pants. - No way.
Like this. Wait five minutes then scrape it off.
And then... roll-on!
The more you take, the longer it takes to grow back.
So you no longer boycott aluminum?
This is different.
Damn it!
- You're not ready? - Just a minute.
Hey Emile.
- Are you Buddhists? - Yes.
- I'll wait outside. - I won't be long.
You look like her.
- Don't forget... - Take it easy.
Well.
Keep an eye on him.
A year later, a picture was found in a parking lot.
He's probably the kidnapper.
Listen.
Nina...
You think you can hear me if I scream?
Try it.
Let me try.
Fix?
What's wrong?
What?
Can you no longer speak?
Don't worry. We will find a solution.
Soon you will fly.
We're together. I'm here.
Get down!
Get down, you idiot! You're gonna kill yourself!
Thanks. Hope you'll enjoy.
Well done!
It stinks!
On the house...
- Ultrasound. - Thanks.
- If it wasn't Roma. - Change the channel, Jacques.
But being three hours late is not okay. His salary is deducted.
I called you 20 times.
Sorry, I was with some friends.
Stop it. I'm okay.
Look at your hands.
What are you thinking?
We agreed. Why aren't you listening?
Why aren't you listening?
Sit down.
No.
I'm protecting you.
No, you're not protecting me!
Sit down.
For 120 euros, I regret coming.
I like your hair.
Take it off.
- Ignore the talker. - Nina!
- Four beers, please. - Here.
- On our youth! - Thanks, friend.
Those jerks. They bother us every year...
Wait. Guys pissing together. Or what, Émile?
Nina is cool.
- Stop. - I don't hear anything.
It only disturbs creeps.
What will you turn into?
Listen to your breathing.
Over here!
- A creep! - Vincent, wait!
Where is Émile?
Get in line!
Come on!
There! He's moving!
I found him!
It's me.
No. Fix.
Frog?
- The boy's father. - Okay.
Luckily we found him first. The creeps are dangerous.
You didn't obstruct any military operation.
Thank you.
Name, date and signature.
I print a new one.
Come on.
Mom...
I saw her. We met.
It was snowing at the top. It was foggy and windy.
Suddenly you said...
"It's majestic."
I did?
What an idiot.
- What? - Nothing.
You are beautiful.
They stink.
You're not going there.
Run.
Run, Émile!
You return to a world bathed in pain.
A paradise of ruination, where the Grim Reaper sees all
and counts down the days until he will meet you all.
The suspect's disappearance is being investigated
5'8", and approximately 120 pounds.
of Hawthorne and Bates Avenues.
That part of the Silver Lake neighborhood
over the last few months.
to lock their doors and keep their eyes open
Hello?
Babe, I don't wanna be alone here.
Colette, don't freak out.
Don't tell me not to freak out. I'm freaking out.
Okay, well, just calm down.
That's worse than telling me not to freak out.
Maybe take a Xanax.
It's not funny.
Okay. Hurry.
Babe, I think I saw someone.
Are the doors locked?
Yeah. Look, I don't wanna be alone.
Okay, you're not alone, 'cause Camille's there, so.
I'm being serious.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Bye.
Hello? - Cole.
Where are you? Somebody's in the house.
What? - Somebody's in the house.
Shit! I'm almost there!
Camille?
Hey, babe!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey. - Hey.
What's wrong?
I heard somebody in the house.
There's somebody in the house.
You okay? - There's somebody
What the fuck, Cole? You're a fucking monster, man.
You've gone way too far. It was just a bad deal.
That was $100,000, motherfucker!
Your call has been forwarded
202-555-0857
is not available.
At the tone, please record your message.
When you have finished recording, you may hang up,
Morgan, pick up the phone. Morgan?
I'm so sorry, baby, but please, please just come home, 'kay?
I, I'm so sorry.
I threw that fucking thing away, okay?
Just, just please, just please,
just please call me back, okay?
Okay, please come home. I love you.
I'm gonna answer it next time he calls.
You will do no such thing, Charlie. I'm mad at him.
Why are you mad at him again?
Guess.
He moved three states over just to be with you.
He's new here. You're a bitch if you don't call him back.
He's probably playing his game right now.
God, every time he loses a life
Can I please just hear his voicemails?
First unheard message.
Morgan?
Anything?
I, uh,
I, I think you have the wrong number.
No.
No wrong number.
You have to call him back.
Lemme guess, he's so sorry for what he did
and he threw his game away.
Actually, that's pretty spot on, sis.
Yeah, I've heard it before.
Turns out he was exactly the same.
Do you love him?
He wasn't always like this.
In the beginning, we used to go places,
like get in the car and start driving
I wanted to break up with him
before I even moved back over here.
Morgan, you just told me you loved him.
I know. I'm so confused.
How's he supposed to act?
- Creeps in. - When you've been through
what I've been through, you'll understand what I mean.
I have a boyfriend,
Like you're acting like a bitch?
What's the point of dating someone
if I have to act like their mother?
Does Howie know you're here?
Did you lie to him, too?
Do Mom and Dad know about that?
If you don't tell me,
But it's not gonna change anything.
Morgan?
Can you see me?
I don't like being hung up on.
If you hang up on me again,
What do you want?
Listen, mister, I'm gonna have to call the police
if you keep calling me, okay?
Call 'em.
Look, my-my-my phone is about to die, okay?
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't fucking hang up on me!
Smart boy.
How did you even get this number?
Do you think he's mad at me?
He's not mad at you, you dip.
What makes you think he's mad at you?
Right. I just feel bad.
Special thinking, from the top.
I really thought he was the one.
My soulmate.
He's gonna be fine.
Know what?
That everything's gonna be okay.
The few times I met Howie,
he didn't make me feel like he was...
You know, toughen him up.
I'm exhausted from all of it.
Easy peasy.
The man is Ian Zane,
and police are following every lead they can
in search of him.
Did you see this?
- We believe he escaped... - Some nut got out
We'll be fine.
Police also insist that if you do see Mr. Zane,
hope he doesn't come around here.
Why? Because you'll kick his ass?
I just don't like how you talk bad about him.
Don't worry. Howie's a pushover.
I'll break the news to him tomorrow.
I'll tell him the truth.
Police urge that if you receive a call
Oh my god!
Interesting.
Assist your guy on the call.
Oh, shit, is that Louis?
Yeah, that's Louis.
He's gonna run. - I got him. You get Louis.
Hey, hey, Louis, Lou, Louis! No, no, no!
Fuck! Not this place!
Shit.
Suspect has entered the,
the Applegate residence.
Fuck.
Copy that. I'm on my way.
Please. Help me.
I wanna go home.
Please.
No.
No, no, no! He's coming back!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Your turn.
the next time, huh, bud?
I didn't do shit!
You know what they say.
Shut up, Frank.
No! no! No, no, no!
We need to go. Hey, hey.
You shoulda asked me earlier.
Well, fuck that!
What is that?
Kevin.
Is he off his sleep schedule?
He's changed.
I'm just trying to be prepared.
He really needs a more structured environment.
Kevin? Dear, perhaps we can talk about this!
What are we even doing here?
Our son.
What?
The way out.
I left the window open this morning.
How we get out.
Oh.
Help me up, you ass!
Come on, pull!
Fuck your psycho-ass child!
I slept with Carl.
You love me and you slept with Carl?
Y-yes.
Ugh. God.
Young ma-
where the innocent perish and the vicious thrive,
it is natural to succumb to fear.
The strong prey upon the weak and vulnerable,
looking to carry them away into the darkness.
The shadows are an ally of predators that stalk unnoticed,
waiting to strike the fatal blow.
So you wanna go somewhere really scary?
I know a place.
It happened back during the Civil War.
A slave named Momma Lou escaped from a plantation
She had just given birth.
because they woulda took her back to her owner,
All right, old-timer. You got my attention.
What happened next?
She held her baby down into the creek.
As they hid down there by the old wooden bridge.
But Momma Lou didn't really know what to do.
As the soldiers got closer,
she kept holding her baby down in there.
But it was too long.
The-the baby was dead.
Oh, my god.
Momma Lou was so devastated,
Well, legend says, if you go out there on Halloween night-
You walk out on that bridge,
and you say, "Momma Lou, I got your baby,"
Okay.
Not too long after, Momma Lou appears
and she's looking for her baby.
And sometimes you see her hanging from the bridge.
Oh, wow.
Is that bridge still there?
so many times, I lost count.
But hell, that don't matter to the dead.
That you wanna see some scary places.
Momma Lou's Bridge is the scariest place I know.
All right, can you draw me a map?
Why, sure. I'd be glad to.
All right, guys, it's Halloween night,
I'm out here on Momma Lou's Bridge, d'you believe that?
What I need to do is say, "Momma Lou, I got your baby,"
three times, right?
And I'm, oop...
but we're gonna do it anyways, okay, all right?
Hold-hold up.
You ready? One, two, three.
Momma Lou, I got your baby.
And nothing, nothing, nothing yet.
All right, one more time. Ready?
Momma Lou, I got your baby!
I guess maybe she didn't hear me the first time.
This is when it's supposed to happen, okay?
'cause you're gonna crap in it right now.
All right, here we go.
Momma Lou! I have your baby!
Nothing. See, look at this.
I'm not kidding. That's-that's freaky.
Where's that coming from?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm not sure where that's coming from.
This is, I'm kinda freaking out. Hold on.
Come on in.
Y'all...
Hold on.
Shit.
You stupid, gullible son of a bitch.
I don't understand.
Heh, so sorry that you're confusing, son.
But you see, there's no Momma Lou.
Just a legend.
Well, a legend and a couple of hungry rednecks.
That's right.
I need to return something, dear.
Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?
Are you trying to have Christmas trump my birthday?
Well, we'll just call it a birthday tree.
No. Get it out.
Fuck.
just a young schoolboy.
Just me and my guitar.
Now, after being on tour,
This one is for you, Baltimore.
It's called "Ride Me to the Top."
Uh, are we not headed out?
I figured a drink first.
Oh.
Well, um,
uh, make yourself comfortable.
Oh.
Well, have a seat.
We should get going.
No, no, no, no.
Listen.
Listen.
There's dancing where we're going.
Are you for real?
and listen for one goddamn minute?
Just know, I don't book anyone on a date.
But keep going.
No. No, no, no.
You know what?
Yeah, no, forget it. Forget it!
Naughty.
How dare you?
You cannot leave.
That's not her line. That's not your line.
That's not her line.
How dare you?
Look, I think...
Oh. Oh, well.
Look at that.
Sit. - This is not my show.
And you're not even in this...
Ah, I got it. Shopping, I know.
Hm. Cheers.
Oh boy.
You know,
Sammy said you were fast.
Yeah. Yeah, you answered the call real quick for that.
Well, you old paper shaker,
tonight was supposed to be about me.
Me!
You're gonna learn to listen. Hmm?
Naughty, naughty, needy Nellie.
Greedy boys go in my belly.
Naughty!
Friday, October 17th, 2020, 2:06 PM.
Hey, it's me.
It's over.
You'd better be there tonight.
Please be sober.
Message saved.
Where is everything?
Open up the safe right now.
I'm not gonna deal with this again.
Open it!
No!
Just let go, man.
You'll upset my wife.
No, no, no!
Friday, October 17th, 2020, 2:06 PM.
Hey, it's me.
It's over. - Message saved.
Hers is the most beautiful mind
we've ever had at this university.
She is dangerous.
Oh, you're just jealous.
She is outside.
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
Exactly!
What she said.
And it ruined the pipes!
What are you doing in the lab after hours?
I thought we were here to discuss
Dr. Clark!
She shrunk my nuts!
See? - He asked for it.
Expelled! - I don't believe anyone
would ask for that. - She misunderstood me.
What were you doing
in the lab after hours? - Order! Order!
I implore you.
Order!
because of what you did to Dr. Clark,
To expel you.
Think of the damage you've done.
Human genitalia is not your plaything-
- This is an outrage. - To do with whatever you like.
Me and my colleagues... He was a pervert!
are so sorry.
You have 24 hours to clear out of your lab.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, please.
I promise I won't talk to that girl again.
Look, it was, it was five minutes.
Okay, look, I won't do it.
You a scientist. You understand.
Like, we was in and out.
I know what this is about.
And then your boyfriend, DeQuan.
I think his name was JeQuan.
Then it was Tara from uptown.
Skinny latte, no foam.
You are a menace!
She shrunk my nuts!
I fucked her life up.
Bitch don't know who she fucking with.
Fucked her whole life up.
Fucked it up.
Shit.
Know who she messing with.
Whoa! What the hell was that?
Shit!
Oh no, you're not getting this brother.
Shit, this brother went to Harvard.
Oh, no. Oh, hell nah.
In this horrific place,
Those who foolishly choose to navigate the hell fire
pay the tolls of their journey in human souls.
and roads paved with the suffering of the damned.
but what lingers on for eternity will claim us all.
Yeah, all right. For what name?
Tanya A. Zornow.
My mother. - Oh, yes, yes.
Your mom called before and we talked about her meds.
Oh, yeah.
Here.
Fine.
We keep hers in the back with all the controlled drugs.
Okay, take your time. I'm in no hurry.
Hello? The lights are out.
Help. - Really?
Sir? I'm coming to help.
Oh! This is bad.
Help. I'm caught.
Here, here. Ow.
Eh, hello?
Mom! Mom.
Ma. Old lady!
Are you deaf or just stupid?
What?
I- - It's time for breakfast.
I don't have all day.
Let's go. Come on.
Number one, you're going to the kitchen,
and number two, hah, it's 80 degrees outside.
Crazy old bat.
And hurry up or you can do your own damn dishes.
Yeah, well, I gotta go get dressed.
I'm already late for work. Ugh.
Stomach pain.
Drowsiness?
Dizziness or weakness.
Temperatures of 104 or above.
Chills, shivering.
Loss of appetite?
Headaches.
Difficulty swallowing.
Mental confusion.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Thank you. See you tomorrow.
It's here.
Ah.
I'm leaving for work now. Stay out of things!
It's still my house.
Oh.
Thank you for again joining us here
in the United States of Horror.
Perhaps you may thrive here.
After all, those with a hunger for the wicked
and a thirst for blood can thrive here.
We will meet again.
But this passionate, despicable land
Farewell.
Wondering what you walked into?
Never been to a strip club before?
It must have crossed your mind. At least once.
You just didn't dare.
I don't mean me!
Miss?
Not love, I hope.
Plenty of choice: blond, brunette...
Look at this Spanish girl. Pretty, isn't she?
No, thanks.
Good bye, sir.
You should go downstairs and take a look first.
Welcoming a new dancer is always special.
who brings energy, youth and naïveté
could be cool.
So be nice to her.
Maybe she's never done this before.
She's pretty!
What an entrance!
How is everyone?
M-I-A, sounds like "meow."
How about a little striptease, Mia?
- Right now? - Sure, why not?
I'm hot.
I'm so hot.
Come over here, away from that gentleman.
You're not here to have fun and hook up. Sorry, sir.
Being a stripper is a profession.
I'll give you an express training session.
In five minutes,
you'll be a working girl.
One very important thing:
take it slow.
Look.
I'm captivating my audience.
And another one.
You bewitch and mesmerize them.
You play with the distance. You seduce them all.
But you pick one special guy.
You turn him on with your magnificent body,
like a subtle serpent.
you touch him.
I'm totally mesmerized.
What everyone else does.
Thank you. Enjoy the show!
Does everyone perform in pairs?
After all, it's just a striptease.
You'll need a stage name.
Aurora, like in Sleeping Beauty?
Very nice.
Elody!
Want some makeup?
Help yourself.
Thanks a lot.
So, how was the king's throne?
You were in the best seat. The king's throne.
If you want, there's room over here
Are you leaving?
I didn't even introduce myself.
Mia.
You liked it. I could tell.
Yeah, I did.
It wasn't creative, like your act.
- You seemed so comfortable. - I'm an actress.
Yeah. I'm applying to the Conservatory.
It must be the boss.
if she wants to smell you, check your size or cast a spell on you.
The boss steals people's clothes?
They say she lives upstairs. I've never seen her.
You're a bit strange.
I'm not a virgin,
but I've never had a real relationship.
Don't worry, it'll happen.
Really? I don't agree.
- She really moves me. - Too much information.
She literally threw herself at me.
Why can't she admit it?
She asked you to keep quiet, pretend it didn't happen.
How many of our friends did she secretly fuck?
Manon?
You heard us? I'm sorry.
Here's 50 euros... for the rent.
My grandmother can wait two weeks.
Take it.
Thanks, anyway.
Special day, Manon?
You're all made up. You look great!
- Got a date? - Nope.
You won't tell me?
So I see.
Just like that!
Unbelievable!
Thank you!
I'm Aurora.
Yes, today's my birthday.
Yes, we had a snack.
- Who's the blonde? - Sati.
She's tough on the new girls, but she's harmless.
I don't like her.
You look young. That's her turf.
We're lucky to have girls like her.
She's useful. Don't say that about her.
I'll say what I like.
Oh, how sweet! Your very first parlor.
Show your claws but be careful.
Wait, what is a parlor?
If they want more, you keep 30%.
The rest goes to the club.
Like withholdings on wages.
If he pays, you can touch him.
You're in charge.
But no sex. Y la boquita cerrada.
Don't be scared. It's a win-win deal.
One guy gave me 200 just to stroke his arm.
See that guy?
I swear!
Be right there.
You're so beautiful!
I bet nobody thinks you're as beautiful as I do.
You won't last here if you don't go along.
Sir, are you disrespecting our strippers?
She wanted to press charges, saw the doctor...
Relax, it's not like she was raped!
Look at it this way: you turned him on.
What shitty luck for a first time!
Don't let this scare you, okay?
No. So put that away.
Marlène always knew how to party.
I love the gold.
Here's another one.
Look.
This one's gigantic.
The spring-summer collection.
Let's put this one on full power.
What a cute nipple cover!
No. I'll show you. Big breasts, small breasts...
You can make it turn.
She's crazy not to lock this stuff up.
If the boss finds it, it all goes into stock.
Maybe she's gone for good.
She talked about it.
That depends on your lemon!
Hi, there.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Manon.
Hello.
I see why you're never at school.
Can you keep it down? We're actually working.
What were you thinking?
Are all your roommates like her?
Different relationships with money. It's complicated.
What we do isn't easy money. It's fast money.
Not everyone can do it.
And she doesn't need to work. It's written on her face.
I have lots of acts in mind, but not the right partner.
Have you ever made love to a woman?
Wrap parties are the best place to make connections.
Give me a sip.
I love that actor.
We didn't shoot together, but I really admire him.
He's so handsome!
Okay, let's go!
We're near the club.
- Let's stop by. - Sure.
Careful.
Hey, cut it out!
Don't touch my friend.
- We just want some company. - Well, I don't.
You won't blow us?
Interested?
Enjoy your evening!
Yeah!
Did you make good money off the little people today?
Ready for tonight's show?
Ready for tonight's indiscretions?
Will you protest with us?
Every Saturday night
Leaning on the bar
Life is rosy
Sipping on my pastis
I spend what I earn
And check out my favorite girl
Let me stay in this club for eternity...
Aurora!
A round of applause!
Aurora!
Who wants to know what it is?
Yes, but I can explain.
That guy? He forced you?
You made me. You said I'd be in trouble if I didn't.
That's not very nice.
Not nice at all.
Did he hurt you, Aurora?
He forced me into a crowd of crazy people.
You can check.
Calm down, Aurora!
Please, calm down.
You know the police loves you.
I'll have to unbutton your shirt.
Shall I?
One more button?
Shall I check...
inside her pants?
Ooh, I feel something.
Aurora?
Yes, officer?
Can you sing the national anthem?
Arise, children of the nation
Our day of glory has arrived!
Good evening!
Welcome. Go right in!
The guy wanted clothes pins all over his body.
You know me, I took my time.
Dragged it out 30 minutes.
Really?
I swear!
You hiked up the price, like I said?
Too much, I think. He's avoiding me.
With your tits, you'll do fine.
Better than a finger!
Hi!
I'm seeing my boyfriend.
- What? - You're gorgeous!
That's the one.
Okay!
Aurora, you have good taste. Come here.
He'll be dazzled.
I like colored mascara. It highlights my eyes.
He's totally into it.
He's hot! Think he'll give you a ring?
- Isn't that Vergine's guy? - Yeah.
Fuck!
- Poor darling! - Sweetheart!
We're here for you.
Sati is really out of line.
We'll see how it goes!
What about you?
Isn't there a single client you're into?
- Truth? - Yeah.
I like his eyes.
You can't even see them behind his glasses!
They're this thick!
He's ugly and cheap! The guy never books a parlor.
Seriously, what do you see in him?
I guess... he's mysterious.
What did you see in your boyfriend?
He's very loyal.
I'm in on your bachelor party gig.
Come on.
There are three guys. It'll be easier if it's the three of us.
They're cool and cute. It'll be great!
If you go, I'll go.
Girls, help me out, please.
Anyone speak English? I can't understand a word he says.
Please, tell me he's not a pervert.
Thanks.
That's amazing!
I can't believe you!
Don't worry, it's cool.
Just private dancing. We keep our G-strings on.
They wanted us all night, but I cut a deal.
Midnight at the latest.
No, thanks.
Seriously?
It's light and delicate.
Gentle.
Are you in marketing too?
Arthur, when's the wedding?
So you're in marketing?
Exactly.
An actress?
A real actress? Famous or not?
Not famous, apparently.
No offense, but we've never seen you.
That's okay.
Don't be insulted.
- I'm not. - Sorry, I laughed.
Hey, I can take a joke.
Look at that neck, that angle...
It's not just your physique. Your voice...
Mother Nature was good to you.
Savannah!
- How far do we go? - No blow jobs.
Just jerk them off, that'll be fine.
Hey, guys!
How about a dance? That's why we're here, right?
As long as Mia dances.
You just sit back and enjoy the show.
A little surprise.
See you soon, gentlemen.
Hang on.
Guys, have you ever seen two women make love?
You'll like this much better.
And you, sit here.
This is what girls do when you're not around.
Need any help, girls?
Oh, no...
She knows exactly what to do.
Don't stop!
She does it so well.
Wasn't that cool?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
I feel disgusting.
Except that they were a bunch of jerks from business school.
It's not that. I tried out for the Conservatory twice.
I'm 26, it's my last chance.
who pay to perform for their friends.
Focus on your next tryout.
What you earned tonight
will allow you to turn down exhausting extra work
that pays dirt.
something happened to me.
This guy I had kind of dated,
the head of a regional theater, called me.
He asked me to dinner with a director friend of his.
I invited a friend, thinking it would be fun.
But it wasn't at all what I expected.
What happened?
We had wine,
and I just didn't see it coming.
But before I knew it, I was in the director's lap,
Where was your friend?
She hadn't arrived yet.
She's always late.
had disappeared.
Anyway...
But I wasn't into it, so I asked him to stop.
I said "no" several times.
but I clearly said "no."
And...
"Shit, he's really going to do this."
I remember telling myself
The guy was ashamed. He ran to the bathroom,
holding his pants.
My friend and I started laughing.
She said she saved her friends
He raped you.
The theater guy...
That's Benjamin!
Say we usher in the same theater, okay?
Hi, love.
Hi, honey.
- Meet Aurora, the new usher. - Hi.
So-so. The actors weren't very good.
You know what I think of theater. If you're not in the play...
Bye.
Bye.
"Forgive me, Madam. With a blush I own
That I wrongly constructed words of innocence.
For very shame I cannot bear your sight longer. I go..."
"Ah! Cruel Prince, too well You understood me.
I have said enough To save you from mistake.
in all her fury.
I love.
But think not That at the moment when I love you most
You know it by heart. You're ready.
Hi, bimbos!
You, too.
You stayed!
Don't you want your fries? They're expensive around here.
Corto Maltese.
You know I have my private clientele.
Occasionally.
She told him she was going to Qatar, to be a backup dancer.
They confiscate passports in Qatar.
That's why we have no news. She's locked up somewhere in the desert.
I bet she married a prince.
You're so negative!
I'd like to suggest something that's forbidden.
0-6...
8-5...
This wine is lovely.
Lots of new tastes in my mouth.
That's the banks of the Rhône.
I'll show you my cellar if you like.
Thank you.
I love your voice.
It's so soft.
Thank you.
I love everything about you.
And I immediately felt a bond.
Am I wrong?
No, you're right.
She's with an interminable but very wealthy client.
Listen to yourself. You sound like a hooker.
We're dancers, not hookers!
It's weird that the money turns you on.
I'm honest about my desire.
So, tell me.
Well...
but it was so obvious and natural.
I was totally wet before we even started.
I was more comfortable with him than most of the guys I've slept with.
Did he take off his glasses?
Not even!
Maybe it was the heat of the moment,
It was quite touching.
And you're proud of yourself, too!
I'm done!
Hi, there.
the great discounts... And you walk in.
with a special delivery... Something like that.
No idea. We'll think about it.
I do my thing.
You come from over there.
Now, it's my turn...
Hello, I'm filling in for my husband who couldn't deliver today.
I brought lots of seasonal fruit.
I have strawberries,
apples,
I have...
Oh, hi...
Want to help us out with the staging?
Thanks, but I have to go change.
You think she saw us?
Right?
Thanks.
I can't stay.
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm no picnic.
You're a beautiful picnic.
On the contrary, it gives me confidence.
I feel alive for the first time in ages.
Yes, I do.
Want a little dance?
I see.
How do you rent here if your parents aren't loaded?
Don't rent in Paris. I'm in Bobigny.
I can't afford to buy.
It's not so expensive these days.
I can make you pay slips. Agencies and landlords love them.
That's fabulous!
Let's go!
I have a new boyfriend.
Really?
Guess what? He's a cop.
I was leaving the club.
He took back the ticket and asked for my number.
It's too early in the day.
You're a goddess!
I listed all my services.
We could create a shared profile if you'd like.
This is an individual profile.
I really think it could work.
Who just want to spice up their lives.
It could be really cool. Take a look.
Working in pairs limits the risks.
When I started having sex,
I couldn't believe
for nothing.
You're jealous.
You're jealous I'm doing it with Elody instead of you!
It's not safe like here.
- Statistically, it's risky. - Statistics can be manipulated.
If they surveyed female lawyers and bakers,
we'd learn that they, too, get assaulted.
Promised.
I'm done. Let's leave together.
You're the jealous one.
Room 712, it's 6 pm. We're on our way
The client pays first.
I'll count it discreetly. You never know.
- It'll be fine. - I wonder what he looks like.
Who knows?
Go!
Seventh floor.
You did it! This man is amazing!
My goodness!
My gorgeous girls!
Can't you sleep over?
I can't.
Benjamin's coming home tonight.
I feel like I found the magic formula.
I'm totally at peace.
I have everything I need!
That's because you're in love with me.
Maybe.
What?
Am I getting carried away?
What gets me going
I love your real name.
Manon.
Tell me a secret.
You first.
I don't like talking about it because...
I dropped out.
I'm sure you know how it works.
Then you find yourself a dissertation adviser.
Mine was a professor I'd studied with.
I met him during my master's.
He was a fascinating guy, regularly published...
The perfect adviser.
He always took me out to dinner. I loved it.
It's silly, but those meals
Then, without saying a word to me,
he left his wife and kids
to live with me.
You wicked temptress!
It's not funny.
I told him I hadn't asked for anything,
I didn't want to commit. Love just wasn't my thing.
And he went crazy.
Obviously, we couldn't keep working together.
You're not allowed to change.
Now you know my secret.
Your turn.
I have a child.
You do?
She's seven.
She's incredible.
A child complicates everything, especially when you're young.
When I started taking private lessons,
I thought he was really cute.
He was a physics student.
Benjamin?
With him, everything was easier.
We were very much in love, and we became organized.
I only see her every other week, so I want to make the most of it.
What's her name?
Eve.
See her in the yellow jacket?
She didn't see us.
Since I started stripping, I've been getting these visions.
Want to hear about them?
Or because she hit a nerve,
Yes, maybe. Well, no. It does scare me!
And with the kids, too...
Even if I'm not around.
I try to call every night when I'm away.
I think she sent you a call for help or a warning.
Show her you heard it. You don't have to change everything.
You could say, "Thinking of you.
I've missed you. It's been a long week..."?
Women love that.
You like the car I rented for you?
Shall we try?
Like this?
I know why you shop with us.
I understand you like to eat melon
in the winter.
That's very bad!
And you, you insist on eating pears in April!
That's just awful.
But here at Cockmart,
- What's up? - Hurry!
- Boyfriend. Why is he here? - Who knows?
I'll fill in for you.
Let's go. This isn't a massage parlor.
Well, sir,
how about a parlor to finish up?
Why are you here?
No. I followed you.
Lately, you seem...
Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.
I thought you were cheating on me.
Sorry, but we have other girls.
Is she your girlfriend?
You're one lucky guy.
She's got a magnificent ass!
Wait for me?
Don't touch a thing.
Very nice. So...
Who should I start with?
Don't touch her!
You never talk about your love life.
I'm with someone who's married.
- Don't let it hurt you. - It doesn't.
Stop.
It's his problem.
You're free.
Nothing to fear or feel guilty about.
- Are you with anyone? - Goodness, no!
What happened with Benjamin? Can you still work?
He still manages to surprise me.
I'm thirsty.
Thank you.
This is Eve.
I'm very happy to meet you.
How do you say "nose"?
"Nose"?
"Mouth"?
- "Ear"? - "Ear" is really cute. Listen.
Hello.
Go ahead.
to the homes where she worked as a maid.
While she worked, we stayed in the kitchen
praise or scold her.
One day, her boss said,
'I'm very disappointed.
You can't be trusted.'
for that tone of voice,
for this world, where humiliating others comes so easy.
Why have I never written about social domination?
whose backgrounds were so different from mine.
I would more or less lie to them about my origins.
With others,
I was deeply embarrassed to admit my origins.
Bravo!
If I'm selected,
You're my good-luck charm!
Bravo.
Thanks! I'm so hungry!
So, if you get in,
will you quit the club?
What's the problem?
I'm worried about your career. It could cause problems.
It's not like I make porn flicks.
True...
But, think about it.
Right?
Bad news. We're out of wine.
I'll open it.
On particles. I study flavors.
Fabulous! I love to eat!
Do you work with molecular gastronomy?
Not really. Flavor, in terms of physics,
There are six different kinds: up, down, strange, beauty.
I'd like to work it into an act.
Beauty quarks come next.
Make room.
That's understandable. But you must have a goal in life?
Give her a break!
Why is everyone so obsessed with life goals?
Yes, it's in the...
in the freezer.
I'm coming.
I think
Benjamin has something in mind.
What would you say
It's off.
What a shame!
We turned down a big opportunity for you.
We're so disappointed.
Each?
Thank you.
You're leaving?
Yes.
- Some other time? - See you soon.
Hello.
Thank you.
Have we met?
No, thanks. But our paths have crossed.
At a wrap party.
I was with a friend
who loves your work.
Stop seeing her.
I paid, so you're going to listen to me.
I take care of her.
Morning, noon, and night.
Our love is real.
- Have you asked her? - Not just at night, for fun.
You've never seen her. I see her all the time.
Shut your mouth!
Just stop seeing her.
Camelia told me about Marlène.
She's in Macau.
She's a surrogate mother for rich fags.
No way! That's fantastic!
She's creating new life.
Candles!
How are you?
Thanks, love.
Thank Mia for me. What a lovely gift.
Don't be upset on my last day.
We know you only came to see her.
- She can do what she wants. - Right. Give me some candy.
It must hurt seeing her with her boyfriend.
He looks so in love.
It's big.
Yeah.
But I was thinking...
I'm such an idiot!
No, you're not.
Not at all.
I think about it, too.
I think about it seriously.
I want us to be together.
But you have to stop hooking.
What's the problem?
I've made a year's rent in two months!
It'll mark you for life.
You think I'm a lost soul?
It'll pollute your relationship with whomever you love.
Selling one's body
No.
But I met someone.
And I believe in us.
Congratulations.
You do? My favorite is tutti-frutti.
We'll need you all summer.
To keep us cool.
What's your favorite?
Mia, what's yours?
Want my psychic's mobile? She really helps me.
- I'm beyond help. - Don't say that!
Mia, I seriously think you're the greatest actress here.
like the first time. You're excellent.
Don't lose hope.
Hi.
Are we not working?
Hey, I'm here!
No, thanks. I'll go get changed. I'm melting.
Why won't you answer my messages?
Listen...
Don't cry.
If we split up, we can't even be friends.
You've never loved two people at once.
One is already more than I can handle.
Don't say that.
I so wish you'd find someone better.
Someone really good for you.
You really don't get it.
I wanted to be with you, not just anyone.
I'm sorry.
Even if it's the last time.
Showtime, girls!
Look who's here.
"You know,
there's nothing worse in the world than to be a free woman.
Willy-nilly, I am immoral.
I am an immoral woman, Platonov. And I love you, perhaps...
because I am immoral.
I shall perish.
If I were only a professor
If I were a diplomatist,
I'd turn things topsy-turvy in this world.
A free woman...
That means, I'm superfluous."
What the hell was that?
Platonov by Chekhov.
The guy didn't come to hear tonterias.
He's waiting for you in a parlor.
She was married.
I waited 10 years for her to leave her husband.
But in the end, she chose him.
Don't lecture me, you little rich bitch.
Back off.
My parents don't help me, but I still refuse perverts.
Yeah, I told the boss. You're fucked.
How was the parlor?
I hope he'll help you get work!
You so deserve this.
I thought it would never end. He wore me out.
What about charging more for overtime?
Not for our regulars, of course.
No, we'll just nail the rich ones.
It sure is.
Look who's here.
Aurora!
Wow! What are you doing here?
I'm treating her to a drink. Great atmosphere.
You worked at the club, right?
- The one with bills stuck everywhere. - Good memory!
In fact, since you left the club,
it's not the same. I never go anymore.
Yes, I completely trust her.
I came up with an idea.
Would you like to finally visit Japan?
Well, no. I want you to go alone.
You lucky girl!
Totally unexpected!
And then, we can get together.
- Hello. - Hello, sir. A parlor?
No, thanks. No parlor.
I saw here recently.
I'm an actor, working on my first feature film.
I'm the director, and I'm looking for an actress.
What did you think?
Let's grab a parlor. We can talk in private.
It's strictly professional.
Here.
Read it.
Call me if you like it. We'll do a test.
Bye.
Hi, Aurora. It's me...
Call me back.
Call me when you get this message.
I have something to tell you.
Even if it's a little awkward.
This is more than just a fling
I know deep down inside
I leave, full of regret,
Your memory engraved in my heart.
I will love you forever...
A FEW YEARS LATER
Aurora never returned from Japan.
No fairy tale.
no husband, no sign of coming back.
Some thought she was dead. Clients asked for her.
Over time, they replaced her with new girls.
Don't count on me to find a moral to this story.
Leave your homes, girls.
without ending up dismembered inside a trunk.
A STAR IS BORN
A NEW FACE LIGHTS UP THE RED CARPET
Did you meet someone?
Someone, yes.
Rather...
a few "someones."
I wanted to start again.
My good fairy.
When I lack inspiration, I think of you
and the time we spent together.
To conclude this special show,
in celebration of your well-deserved retirement,
we have a little surprise for you.
I have compiled the stories of every girl here today,
and I like to tell them
But there's one story
yours.
I hope you didn't believe me when I said
We spend our whole lives looking for love,
losing it, and finding it again.
True love, romance, tenderness...
It all grows like weeds
He was the one who brought you to a hospital full of male doctors.
11:56
Oof! What was it?
-Shut up. -[man 2] Calm down, man.
Abu Kholoud mixed it with the tea.
It's far. No.
Just listen.
2:00 P.M.
Head back? Are you serious?
You want to cancel the whole day because of this douche?
BALILA ZAMAN
[herder] Cover it up so that the mother won't see her child. Cover it.
-You're in your old man's car? -[Saad] Yeah.
8:00 P.M.
Don't be shy.
[guy 1 grunts] Shut up.
[nurse] No, Doctor.
[doctor] This was an emergency.
Right back at you! What?
-Just piss off. -You piss off! You're spiteful.
There's no need for a lot of fuss.
No, Abu Fahad. Bless you.
"Our Hawks, the Saudis…"
Indeed. I'll just leave it here.
[Abu Fahad] Then charge it.
-Am I right, Abdullah? -Absolutely, Abu Fahad.
Then, you pull the sword and throw the sheath. Like that.
[shrieks] Hey! Open the door!
[cop 1] Listen, girl.
-Praise be to Allah. -[groans]
Hello?
[commentator in Arabic] I'll praise them deservedly.
The Samsung charger fits, see?
Um, doesn't it fit your phone?
No matter how long we falter…
Tssk.
-Tssk. -Do you have a cigarette?
-Oh my God. -It's burning!
[herder] Go straight
[commentator] …play has stopped at the moment,
What a wonderful and confident victory!
Bravo to each and every player,
The nostalgia. We do not rest on our laurels.
He grounded me for a month, but in the end, he appreciated my honesty.

Beautiful.

Hop in! There's room for everyone!
Come on. Hop in!
We got more seats!
More seats!
Seriously?
Oh, you're not?
Thank god!
Come on. A guy as good-looking as me?
Nope. That's why I thought you were.
Ouch! That hurts.
So, what are you? A call boy?
You're right.
What are you up for?
Nothing.
Wait, are you serious?
I knew it.
Fine.
You're kind of cute.
Kind of?
Okay, chill.
So...
So?
Not even in my dreams.
Okay.
If you say so.
So, if you don't want to do it here, how about in my place, or yours?
Sorry.
I'm just not into that right now.
That sucks.
I was supposed to meet somebody else but I got catfished.
My car won't even start. Bummer!
You deserve it.
Are you mocking me?
I thought I got some consolation
Only to find out he's a bully.
Me? A bully?
What if I'm having a bad day too?
I got catfished. My car broke down.
Then you dumped me.
I've had it worse.
I failed my licensure exam.
I'm sorry.
We're near the bus stop!
I gotta get off.
Alright. Take care.
You, too.
Hop in! There's room for more!
Did you forget something?
Yes.
You.
Me?
Fuck love.
That's enough.
I get that a lot.
Damn it! How to be heartless?
Unfortunately, this lifestyle is not for everyone.
I doubt that you can survive being alone.
Don't you feel lonely?
Why would I?
If you can do it, I can do it, too.
It's better said than done.
Look at you,
Why don't you think of ways to win back Chan?
But he wouldn't take me back.
He doesn't want me anymore.
- Happy Monthsary! - Hi!
What monthsary?
I don't do monthsaries.
That's your karma.
Now you're head over heels for an "ugly" guy.
Silly.
Why don't you visit me here?
And watch you read books?
Why not?
You don't want to be a lawyer, neither an accountant.
So what are you studying for?
There's a...
Weighing your options is different from walking away.
Weighing your options or...
Tino, please stop tempting me.
Just saying.
But if ever you'd run off with me,
And become my responsibility?
First of all, you're rich.
You have stocks and investments.
Maybe you just need to relax a little bit.
You look so tired.
That's good.
Hang on.
Someone's outside.
I'll call you back.
Is Tino there?
I'll talk to him.
Tino, I know it's hard to understand, but listen to me.
You might think I've lost my mind
but I have thought about this.
Your mother and I talked about this.
We both decided that we owe it to ourselves
What? I'd rather move out!
Tino, please!
Hi!
What happened?
Why? What happened?
Anywhere far from here.
Hold on. Calm down.
No.
Huh?
Wait a sec.
Are you serious?
Christian?
Son, are you busy?
Kinda.
Why, mom?
He's with Thomas.
Sure.
Alright. I'll tell your dad.
Sure.
So where are we going?
You're coming with me?
Yes!
You're right.
I probably need a break.
I’m dying to hug you.

Look how lovely this place is.
This is your room.
Looks good to me.
How about you?
I'm okay with it.
Okay. Thank you.
Auntie, you look familiar. Were you in the movies?
You still recognize me. That’s great!
I knew it!
'60s is too old. I was from the '80s to early '90s.
Had I not retired, I could've lasted until early 2000s.
Thank you.
I'm generous like that.
And I'm an ally, too.
I support people like you.
You're human beings, too, right?
The room is all yours. Do whatever you want.

What are you doing?
What do you think?
Are you ready?
Hey! Wait!
I should've ended it when I had the chance.
I didn't want to.
But Chan...
Chan was the only exception.
Upper body first...
Ready...
And ready. Go up.
And go up!
You're better than him, sir.
- There. Okay? - There you go! Bend your knees.
Let's see. Just look straight and go up.
There you go! You're such a fast-learner, sir!
What if you fall?
If you fall?
Catch me.
Which one? To surf?
Nope.
I'm an obedient child, you know.
I don't want to rush into things without having a solid plan.
Or we could just sell our videos online.
What do you think?
Seriously,
Let's not talk about them.
Look at the gorgeous view.
This is so good.
It's getting hot in here.
The sun is up.
Just like your dick.
It's your fault.
You're sexy.
And you can do all sorts of things on this body.
Except penetration.
Yeah. We need to talk about that.
I don't know.
I'm not sure yet.
What do you mean "official"?
You know what I mean.
Nope.
Care to explain?
You already know it.
Maybe I gambled too hard and I lost.
He knew what he was getting into.
Everything that happened to us was his choice, too.
Chan!
But I know we were happy.
We were happy.
Our relationship wasn't perfect, but we were okay.
Yes, it was just video call, but I thought it meant something.
Of course, it meant something.
So you mean what we have isn't official?
God, Chan! It's not that serious!
Well, I'm serious.
Am I giving up everything for something that's not serious?
How stupid of me?
Wait!
Wait.
Did I force you to go with me?
I'm sorry.
Fine.
Let's get it out of the way.
I have never been in a serious relationship before.
sex is very important.
So yes, it's a dealbreaker for me.
I survived the last six months because of you.
You make me happy when you listen to my stories...
I really wanted it to be true.
It's like waking up from a perfect dream.
Really?
Yes.
I want to go home.
Then go home.
He was the only person I truly cared about.
Are you okay?
Yes, I am. I just lost my balance.
Slowly.
Okay, I'm good.
Ouch! Thanks, sir.
Thanks, sir.
You're leaving just because we had a fight?
Chan, please don't go.
Please stay.
- Sorry. - It's alright. It's okay.
Chan...
Why?
Your teeth...
Sorry.
It's okay.
Chan, Chan...
It's okay. I'm good.
- I used to have braces. - It's okay.
Why?
Yes.
Stop, stop.
Stop.
Are you okay?
- Yeah. - Let's try again?
Yeah.
Okay.
Chan, Chan...
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let's just jerk off?
Are you coming? Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Slowly.
Almost there.
Wow!
Let me have this.
My boyfriend is such a gentleman.
Thank you.
Not just a gentleman,
but also a sweet lover.
The type that you'd introduce to your parents.
That's the goal.
How about me?
Will you introduce me to your parents?
It's not you.
It's my parents.
That's new.
Not really.
I think it's me.
I already told you that I was adopted, right?
But you were a consistent honor student, right?
You even graduated with the highest honors.
I'm sure they're proud of you.
I am proud of you.
I have a crazy idea.
Shoot.
Never mind.
Forget it.
- It's nothing. Never mind. - Come on.
Okay, fine.
I'm just wondering...
Are you open for an occasional third?
I'm not sure I got that right.
Okay.
threesome?
No...
I don't know.
I know what a throuple is.
But I don't think it's for me.
No, no.
It's just pure hook up.
Of course, with a stranger.
We won't be doing it frequently.
I don't know...
Once...
Twice...
Or thrice a month?
Just so we could get off.
I don't know.
It never crossed my mind.
It's fine.
It's okay. It's just an idea.
A crazy idea.
It's okay.
Silly!
Then why are you staring at me?
Yes?
Yes?
Fine.
I'm considering it.
You already know it.
Just say it.
Your proposal.
That thing you wanted to try.
That we'll get into an open relationship.
For real?
But we should set some rules, okay?
Of course!
We are not going to date other people.
We are just going to fuck them.
Wow.
Right.
I'm okay with this one.
Nope.
Come on!
This one?
I'm sure you like this type.
No.
What's your type?
Hunk?
Twink?
Jock?
Bear? Chub? Otter? Effem?
I don't know.
- Okay? - Okay.
Hi!
What took you so long?
I just bought something.
What's that?
Take a guess.
Food.
Did you swim?
Nope.
I have something to tell you.
I bumped into this gorgeous surfer while I was jogging on the beach.
And then I fell that's why I got wet.
Gorgeous?
Who's gorgeous?
You look fine.
What?
Jealous?
You haven't even met him.
If he's on the app, then I'm good with him.
For real? You're okay with him?
Who's this guy, anyway?
He gave me his number.
Sure.
Let's eat?
What's this?
It's not that painful.
Stop complaining. We're almost there.
Joaquin?
Hey! You made it!
You made it!
I thought we got lost.
This is Tino, my boyfriend.
Boyfriend. I see.
I'm Joaquin.
It's dirty.
Okay.
So, wanna come in?
Let's go?
Let's go.
Okay.
Let's go.
You want egg?
- I'm good. - Alright.
I get that a lot.
We're still talking about the food, aren't we?
Of course.
So about pottery...
is it your hobby or your business?
I only take orders if I want to.
I get what you mean.
How long have you been into pottery?
I don't have time for hobbies.
I don't usually do protégés.
I'll make an exception.
- Really? - Yeah.
Why?
I'll look forward to that, Joaquin.
Sure.
That's all you got?
You like it?
You feel good?
Fuck.
Hey, hey.
- Wait. - What?
Fuck me.
Shit.
Sorry.
I feel good.
Fuck!
You good?
It's good?
Go for it!
So hot!
Good thing you're back.
What's wrong?
You have a visitor.
She said she's your relative so I let her in.
Go ahead and see her. I'll go play mahjong.
Thank you.
Let's go?
Tino!
Tino!
Tino!
How did you know I'm here?
I saw your post online.
I also asked around.
I understand why you're furious.
Then good!
Because I'm not going with you.
- Tino. - Tino.
Tino.
I'm not asking you to come home.
You should patch things up.
She's been drinking again.
I was there when you left us to be with a man.
I was there when she was heartbroken.
I was there! I'd pick her up in random bars because she was so drunk and wasted.
I'd clean her up.
I know.
Then why did you abandon me?
Believe it or not, I love your mom.
Get out of my life.
Please.
That's what you get from running away.
I won't deny it,
I'm no saint.
But I never ran away.
Don't compare me with you. I was honest with my ex-wife.
I wasn't running away from anyone.
I came here to live life as I want to.
- But you also hurt other people, right? - But I'm not an asshole like you.
Fuck, okay! Fine! I'm an asshole!
Yes! You're an asshole so enough with your excuses.
You talk like you're not at fault.
So it's her fault now?
Why? Am I wrong?
Do you think I chose to be an asshole?
She was only thinking of herself.
It's all about her and her own fucking happiness.
When my mother left us,
I only cried once
Damn, it was hard.
The first few months was hard.
Until she moved on.
And I moved on, too.
We were okay.
We were happy.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You can talk to me about it.
I'm fine. Just cuddle me.
I'm sorry, it's quite messy.
Thank you.
Let's just wait for Tino.
He's out for a surfing lesson.
Let him be.
The more you stop him, the more he'll resist.
I just want to make sure that he's okay.
It's good that I met you.
The truth is,
That's normal.
Her Mommy Hazel once told me that Santino is allergic to relationships.
That's why I was surprised when I met you.
It's probably our fault.
Maybe we're not good role models for him.
Maybe that's also the reason why his first boyfriend cheated on him.
First boyfriend?
Yes.
When he was a teenager, he dated a much older guy.
It happened while Hazel and I were preoccupied with our own problems.
And when we found out, it was too late.
Tino was traumatized.
And I understand why he is indifferent towards me.
It's fine. I'm just reviewing for an exam.
Yes.
I really hope so.
I think that's stress.
When I was in college, I cope through meditation.
I'm tired of all your excuses.
What?
I'm trying my best here to be on your side.
You have a choice,
and you choose not to forgive.
It was your choice to be an asshole.
Tino.
Tino!
What?
Are you mad at me?
What do you think?
I told you I don't want to talk about them.
But you even cozied up to my mother.
Tino, she was just helping me out.
I don't know what you're going through
because you're not telling me.
I hate this.
All this drama.
Not too hard but not too soft.
Am I doing it right?
Yeah.
Okay. Now...
Joaquin, what the hell?!
- What? - What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
Can we focus, please?
No.
Forget it. Let's just fuck.
I am only going to do it with you when we're with Tino.
Okay?
Because?
Because?
I thought this is consented cheating.
What? No one's cheating here.
No one?
You know.
I tried to seduce Chan.
But you,
you have a chance.
He cares a lot about you.
on what really matters to you.
Should we call Joaquin?
Does he really have to be here when we're having sex?
I thought you're enjoying it.
Why don't we let him decide for our relationship?
Chan.
Chan, please. I don't want to argue.
Please, let's not fight.
I don't want to make a big deal out of this.
Fuck! This is why I hate relationships. There's too much drama.
This is not just drama.
I love you and I will never hurt you.
Did my mother tell you that?
Do you think you're doing me a favor?
You know nothing about my past!
- I said... - Shut up!
Shut up.
Tino?
Good thing I found you here.
What happened?
Can we talk this time?
What are you doing here anyway?
But I promised your mom that I will fix this.
Don't you think it's too late for that?
I was so thankful when you and mom broke up.
I thought I was the only reason why you stayed together.
Whatever your mom and I went through,
Yes,
that's why you left me,
because your boyfriend didn't want me in your life!
You abandoned me.
- Because your mama needed you... - I needed you!
I'm sorry.
But son, I'm here now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
You're right.
I deserve to be alone.
Fuck it.
I mean... Come on.
It's fun to not commit.
When you're not responsible for someone else's feelings but your own.
Coming.
It's you.
Disappointed?
Okay. I will answer one of your questions.
I'm only human.
I wish I had someone to celebrate with.
But I'm over it.
So over it.
It's hot.
It's hot.
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Just pretend that I'm Chan, okay?
I'm Chan.
Fuck!
Tino!
Wake up.
Tino! Wake up.
Take a shower. Go!
It's up to you. Wake up.
Coming!
Chan... Chan, wait!
Chan..
Chan, wait..
Calm down.
Chan, calm down, please.
Please, can we not resort to violence?
Chan.
Chan.
Wait.
Chan, enough.
Tino!
That's enough, Chan.
Chan! Please!
That's enough, Chan!
Stop it!
Wait.
Chan, stop it!
Are you sure about this?
I said stop, damn it!
I don't mind being used to fix your fucking relationship.
I'll just take a shower.
But when I'm done, I want the both of you gone.
Okay?
Chan, please say something.
Do you want us to fight and scream at each other?
Do you want to end this?
Why?
Curse and hurt me all you want.
Because I feel stupid
Whenever there's a problem, I always run away
To avoid getting hurt.
Not everyone will leave you,
If you want be like me, it's up to you.
But you...
you have so much love to give.
you have to forgive yourself first.
There's still room. Hurry!
The bus is leaving now!

Dear sports lovers...
Presenting the final contest of the 5th All Kerala Tug of War competition...
...organised by Dynamo Arts and Sports club.
From Kasargode, the land with the fusion of 7 languages including Kairali and Kannada...
to the martial grounds of Ananthapuri where Anantha Padmanabhan is enshrined...
and the other side is Udaya, Pallipadi.
...has turned the western horizon blood red.
Come on man, pull!!
Come on pull!
Hey Sara!!
Here Christone Rajakkad, Idukki wins!
After witnessing 24 champion teams battling here at The Dynamos Arts and Sports Club...
Don't blame me now.
Enough, there's no point in arguing. Let's go.
For what?
Ahh?!
Get down fast.
Sarah, stop fooling around and give me the key.
...by the next day morning everything will be fine.
- Goodnight! - Goodnight.
Sara!
Sara...
Don't scream. I'm not deaf.
You don't deserve an answer for that.
Mom, she is a spoilt brat.
Don't worry about that.
I think she will find someone and get married herself.
You should leave that child to her ways.
Don't simply torture her.
Hello?
Mama!
What's the matter?
I need to tell you something.
Is this a matter to be presented within a community?
Death was passed to us through Eve.
Due to her disobedience, Eve brought in death for herself and the human race.
Hey, ride properly you idiot!
Take his details, charge him a fine and let him go. Don't take up such headaches.
Keep the change.
Thank you Sir.
Drink less.
You are like a brother to me.
Where's your bike?
What's the case?
It's a drink and drive case.
Ok, give me one hours time.
It's for you.
Are you mad?
Hey...
Keep the bike with you.
It's become a daily routine.
He can't be reformed.
Okay, brother
Shucks!
Your seat has already been given, Sir.
There is a seat behind. Go and sit there.
You go and sit there.
You can go and sit anywhere.
Sir...sir...
Young man...hey young man...
Bro...please.
Look at him!
He is completely sloshed!
Switch off the lights.
It's none of our business.
Vodka.
Keep quiet.
Hey, please dear, come!
What's the matter?
Just to simply woo her.
Who is Lakshmi, your girlfriend?
My mother.
I am Mike.
Antony.
Isn't Mike a boyish name?
It's something like that...organ reassignment!
Huh?
Gender reassignment!
The bus will halt for ten minutes.
Those who wish to have refreshments can carry on.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
I want someone to accompany me while having food.
The dew from heaven!
We brewed it ourselves.
I am exactly like a boy.
Not mine, but my mom's boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
Ok
You can pour it off anywhere and at anytime.
Ayo...Anto...chetta...
Stop...!
Hey...
Shucks with his peeing!!
What a bad time!
Antony John.
This is like inviting unwanted trouble.
Yes exactly.
You will miss the bus, kiss and all.
(Playing Tamil movie song on radio)
She's a girl.
I'm a big foodie.
At home there are tons of complaints.
...I'll kick your balls off
Let's go.
Meanwhile, a guy tried to touch me.
I'm very affable!
I understood that.
I'm meeting someone like you for the first time.
Me too.
Hey...hey buddies...why don't you join us?
Come on.
Have one, bro.
You are very lucky.
Isn't your life awesome?
Having someone in your life is always great.
I am a Collector.
Ehh?
Really?!
Oh...
...you were lying.
No problem.
Telling lies doesn't make us crooks.
KL-56...
This truck is heading to Kerala.
That's it.
Bye...
Yes.
What is your plan after reaching your hometown?
Aha...! That's an awesome plan!
I have certain things to do after this organ reassignment.
We'll reach soon.
Yes move on...right.
This land got bushy so soon.
You continue ploughing.
...to wedlock and settled with kids.
In that way, you are fortunate.
This guy!
Do you have anyone else to inform?
His family is seeking marriage alliances even for him.
Their blessings will always be with you.
I'll throw sand at you!
Hey, what about Sanal?
He is still here.
What friend are you then?
Don't jump into decisions for such silly thoughts.
Sara...
Hey, pass me the oil.
Do some job man...at least something.
Get lost man!
Will that girl continue living like a boy?
Buzz off, man!
Not like you roasting chicken...
Look at the choices of people!
If these women behave like this, what will we men do?
Not we, only you.
He is blabbering since long!
Tell him to shut up.
Give him some.
Now you do what you want.
Bro, roast the remaining before leaving.
- Tell him some more stories too. - Goodnight.
Mithun must have come.
Buzz off man.
That was not needed.
Bro, let's sit until sunrise.
...that girl's story sounds great...
I liked it.
Antony...
Hey...
Somebody named Mike has come to see you.
Let's go.
Look at his sly smile.
Ok.
How did you reach here?
What's your plan?
Come.
Hey...hey...
You should come with me for the surgery.
No one I know is ready to stand by me.
Hey, it's a harmless service.
Hey, just help me.
Till then where will you stay?
Your room may be upstairs?
Just come up.
When will this get over?
I will make you free before 18th.
After the surgery starts you can go.
Later, I'll appoint a home nurse and adjust.
It's good!
"The Good Death!"
Anyone will feel like dying after reading this.
Antony John.
'On a four legged cot, under a three winged fan...'
Who is this Swathi?
For better or for worse.
A bit...
Please...
Mom...
I'll call Antony.
Come mom.
What's it man?
Come.
Chetta, one coffee.
Move.
Move man!!
Hey...
What's your problem?
Hey...hey...get away...get away.
Come on, speak up
Mom...!
How dare you mock my mother?
Hey hit him!
Hey hit him!
Hey hold him!
Get aside.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Move aside.
Come on.
Hey leave him.
Catch him.
Move away.
Hey Umesh come on...Antony!
Antony!
Antony!
Hey...hey...move.
Leave him...I said leave him!
Move away.
Move away!
Hey, Sanal!
Hey...Antony...
Hey...get a car...get a car.
Sir, take care at that side.
Hey...he is running away.
If your son has some mental disorder, keep him at home.
Huh...?
Huh?
You can go only after the police comes.
Get away.
Hey...move...move away.
Hey catch him...hey stop there.
Hey block him.
Mom!
Mom...!
- Yes...look there. - Stop there.
Shucks...!
Come bro, let's go home.
Get up...come.
Let's go.
Yes...pull over here.
Here...hmm.
Antony, get down. We've reached home.
Hey hold him.
Slowly.
Hey, won't you drop me home?
Yes, I will.
I lost my mother because of my flaws.
To listen to her...
...and to answer her back...
...I was the only one she had.
I'll go only after fulfilling your wish.
Because it's a long process.
I know, Doctor.
Anyway it's upto you.
I have my reasons.
Sara, can you wait outside for a minute?
Antony, this is not a trivial matter.
Once Sara starts changing totally, we can't predict how she will react.
Why should I?
Why are you reassigning this?
Simply.
Within five minutes, those guys sitting there will start staring at me.
You are right.
Boys always have the freedom for everything.
They don't have to be back home by 6 pm.
They can go anywhere at any odd time.
Chetta, please.
Thank you.
You can sleep with anyone at anytime.
Shall I ask you something?
I want to know how it works.
Bro, I thought it is for you.
I searched a lot bro, a lot.
All of them are straight.
This one is my friend's friend, Lily.
I'll go and meet the person.
Bro, that's done...ok.
Let's start with some wine.
Sure.
Are you a bisexual?
I haven't identified yet.
She was great!
What happened?
Nothing.
There, that was our usual spot.
Hi.
You brought me here to see this scoundrel.
Leave me.
We'll solve it.
Hmm...let's solve it.
Hey!
Hit me back!
- Qasi,leave him. - Leave me!
Hey...no...
Who is he?
Shucks!
Hey, tragedies aren't the only experiences.
Hey come on.
What happened?
Hey Qasib, Swathi has delivered a baby.
Who?
Hey deaf guy, not my wife.
Hey, Swathi has delivered a baby.
Come up...come.
My hand...
At least hold this cover.
You can hold that.
Hey your thralldom won't work here.
Get your hands off me.
It's a hospital. Come out I'll show you.
Sara.
You eat it.
Then who else will eat?
- Dear... - Not now Mom.
Was it a smooth labor, aunty?
Oh...no...no!
Where is Mithun?
He has gone home to get some dresses.
Tell him we want a treat.
Oh nice!
How is my baby?
Her same eyes and nose.
I felt magical.
Having a baby exactly like us.
After my 12th grade.
After a month, Papa passed away.
Then Mom and me never stayed there.
I have many.
But none of them come here.
Oh...that was great.
Both of them were very happy together.
'Come...come faster'
After 2-3 days it will start reacting in the body.
Don't roam around outside a lot. You have medicines.
We can start the surgery after two weeks.
You will have to continue the hormone treatment even after that.
Relax.
Let Sara be under observation for some time.
Ok Sir.
You still have the time to rethink.
I think you should talk to her.
She is confused.
All I can do is stand by it.
Let's go.
It's just nonsense. That's meant for girls.
I worked at few places.
Come.
Only if you have learnt it.
I have learnt it. I've experienced it many times.
You should combat after knowing the strength of your opponent.
No.
You could simply sit quietly somewhere.
Why did you go for such unwanted things?
Laugh once more.
Did it hurt?
No.
Now?
Is it paining now?
No.
Now?
No.
Come get up.
Hello.
This is from Kattappana Police Station.
How is Sherly related to you?
You have to come to this station as soon as possible.
Ok.
Shall we take her home, Sir?
Especially when Sara has a clear decision.
Hmm.
What settlement was that, Sir?
You can request your daughter but can't force her.
Why is the sea called Mother Sea?
Why can't we call Father Sea?
I think masculinity has started affecting.
(FATHER SEA)
Hmm...ship...!
I think you like the sea a lot dear.
Papa will take you.
Someone has come with Sebastian to see the shed.
- Sherly,bring the key with you. - Hmm.
This will be enough. If we could get in and see...
What was it used for before?
My school was in Bangalore.
- Oh Abraham... - Greetings,Chetta.
- Ok. - See you.
Don't make them wait.
One...
- Because I liked Taekwondo... - Two...
- I also joined his classes. - Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
Nothing can replace money.
Couldn't you be born as a boy?
What's wrong with you, mom?
Come on...
Everything was fine in the beginning.
Lift both your hands up...
...1...2...3...go.
Very good.
Come.
1...2...3...go.
Come.
1...2...3...
Hey!
Kapil...come on.
Yes...very good.
Continue.
Sara is a talented girl.
Keep going.
Ready...1...2...
...I discontinued the Taekwondo classes.
Good morning master. Good morning master.
Sara!
He was very happy there.
I didn't tell anybody when Papa called.
He was living in a cramped room with many inmates.
I was very angry with him since he left me and went.
Thinking on his side...
...Papa must have done the right thing.
Hey...get out!
Don't act over smart. Better stay in your limits.
Hey you!
I left home that day with the gold Mom reserved for my marriage.
Come...let's go.
Sara...
Antony...
Antony...
Antony...
Get your hands off me.
Mom, who is this man? You...
Mama!
Mama!
Hey...you!
Hey...you!
Open the door!
Mama!
Hello Sir.
This is regarding Miss Sara Thomas's gender reassignment surgeries.
The first one is scheduled on this 23rd.
We just want to reconfirm your appointment.
You have a happy news.
They asked you to get ready for the surgery.
Mastectomy.
Removal of breast.
Enough, come let's go.
A bit more time.
You go.
Do what you want.
Sara's medicines.
And welcome back. This is RJ Mike.
We were talking about travels.
It's all about the journey, not about the destination.
Only when we are lost in our travels, do we explore new ways.
In our life there may have been...
...some unforgettable...
...or some travels that have created an impact.
So...
...let's hear each other out.
...is 7-3-5-6-0-4-4-4-8-4.
So let's meet up again tomorrow morning.
This is RJ Mike, signing off. This is your own Music Monk.
Hey Anto...
Mike.
Someone has come to see you.
Mastectomy?
See, this is a like a metamorphosis.
After gender affirmation surgery...
...it is important that you shouldn't feel incomplete.
After the transition, your confidence should increase.
...then he can undergo physical transition.
The reasons you are saying now to transform into a man...
...aren't silly in my opinion.
I can figure out social reasons in it.
That's why you desired to transform into a man.
You should strive to achieve them by continuing as a woman.
That should be your motive, Sara.
Don't you think you should strive to achieve it?
You took away the name I had reserved for myself.
Mike...
Huh...? Huh?
'There is a cafeteria close by.'
'Where were you all this while?'
'Amsterdam.'
'But I never expected you at all.'
Where is everyone?
Where's my car?
I'm not whoever you think I am.
Ever since Gabriel called you by your real name, I knew.
They're scripture.
'Little Kunjali wants to sleep'
'come and put him to sleep, slowly'
'he is a mischievous boy'
'little Kunjali wants to sleep'
'come and put him to sleep, slowly'
...is coming back here like a beheaded goat.
Let's stop...
What was his name?
Mangattachan.
Yes, that's it.
As long as he is leading the Zamorin's army...
Don't take things lightly, your highness.
We need help from the Portuguese.
If you don't want to lose your crown and sceptre,
...that is the only option you have!
It's not that, shankaran thampi.
If you don't want to see Zamorin's nairs plundering the Kochi palace,
'm'.
His highness sent this for you.
What do they want?
Kartaas?
What is this kartaas?
there won't be any money, even to buy water for the bull that pulls the cart.
Idiot!
Hold it firm!
Load the gun.
Lift it straight up!
Tend to your shoulders.
Aim at the pig's head!
Bang!
What's the occasion?
A wedding is going to happen in the Marakkar family.
Wow! - Mammali!
Bow before him!
Marakkar, the...?
His name is Muhammed Ali.
We call him Kunjali at home.
We've decided to conduct the wedding next month.
She is kaippulli haji's younger daughter.
These kids grew up together.
Everything will go well!
Marakkar...
What did you tell them then?
Now, you better obey what they are saying!
That's all.
You needn't come here again to talk about this, Marakkar.
What are you saying, brother?
load them on to fishing boats,
I'll show you how the Portuguese would stand gaping in wonder!
Kunja...
Don't sweat with oil on your head, and catch a fever!
I'll take care of that.
Kunjali...!!
Come here.
Ask for his forgiveness.
He's a child, right?
Just forgive him.
He did it unknowingly.
'Mama'
Mama... - Careful, kunja.
Don't hit your forehead on the door.
It's bad omen.
When the Zamorin said that they can't enter calicut,
the Portuguese came with a huge Navy,
and waged war at ponnani beach.
As Zamorin's left hand, there was mangattachan at the coast...
And as his right hand, I was at the sea.
Along with my son kuttypokkar Ali...
We fought for 3 days continuously, day and night.
The Portuguese Navy was burned down,
So many people died.
Here...
Even if he gets married,
Though we won the war,
...including your father.
After burying him...
...and surrendered his sword before the Zamorin and bowed to him.
The same night...
and walked south with him.
That's how we reached here...
Not a single ship will reach your harbour now.
The traders are all standing united with Kuttyali Marakkar.
Hey! Well...
I know what to do.
What is it?
'The words of the heart are spoken through the eyes'
'the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes'
'the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes'
'you have become the guiding light of my life'
'this is the intoxication of love, my beloved'
'i can't find peace even when I sleep'
'the words of the heart are spoken through the eyes'
'we shall make our dreams come true, my companion'
Listen, brother... It's almost twilight.
So be it, moidutty. Tell the riders.
This is for you.
Turn this side!
What is this?
I inherited this from my ancestors.
What is written on this, mother?
As long as this is on your neck,
god will protect you!
I'm going to sleep, brother.
There might be reptiles in the bushes.
Stop there, you...!!
I asked you to stop!
Where are you running?
Ayesha!
Come down, girl.
Will you hit me?
Then why are you holding that stick?
Then throw that stick away, and climb up here.
I'll catch you.
I will jump! - Go ahead!
Come on, jump!
Ayesha!
Ayesha!
Uncle, what is this...?
Keep quiet.
Moidutty?
Shut up and come!
Have we got them all?
Two more rascals are yet to be found.
Search everywhere! - Señor!
Nobody is here, señor!
Where are they?
Kunja...!!
Mother! - Son...
O lord!
Don't go!
Mother!
Mother!
I have no idea what actually happened.
...to slash the head of kaippulli haji.
Will their people spare him?
When I went back and checked at dawn,
everything was burned down.
You are the senior Marakkar now.
You should sell it all to the Portuguese.
That too, for the price they quote!
Otherwise, whatever you cultivate, will go rotten lying in your houses.
If there is no other way, we will do as you say!
Moidu uncle!
Mammali...!!
I cannot see even one star!
Get me the compass from that bag!
Okay.
Careful!
Mammali!
Go up and straighten the sail.
Son, mammali.
Climb carefully.
Uncle!
Move the ship to the right, mammali...!!
Go inside.
Show the plate.
You should understand something, Abdul rahman haji.
it was my duty to ensure the welfare of the people.
Now this land is ruled by the Zamorin king.
Our mosque has rice and groceries only for a couple more days.
The storms took away the boats and huts of the fishermen.
Wipe off all that blood, and get a plate from somewhere.
You can take this plate.
Uncle!
Mammali...!!
Uncle!
Pour it.
I was really worried wondering whether something happened to you.
There is one way.
Give it here.
Take it & run! - My money!
Who is he?
Some outsider.
Give me my money!
Return my money, I said!
Keep it with you.
Go, take it!
Touch it if you dare!
Rice to eat and clothes to wear,
and money to rebuild houses and repair the boats,
have been sent here by his highness Zamorin.
Who is he? - Mangattachan.
The authority to distribute it by verifying names and houses,
The bullock carts can go directly to namath house.
You can unload all the goods there.
Are they your sons, mangattachan?
This is ananth and this is achyuth.
Sheesh!
Take this.
Hey!
Pick it up and give it.
Do you know who I am?
Hey!
What's the matter?
What do you want?
Look at his attitude!
Who is he?
I've never seen him earlier.
Whoever he may be...
There's nothing wrong in what he said.
What is your name?
Show me your face!
You've brought the grains from your wife's house, is it?
I just asked when I saw you donating it in plenty!
Okay! Lock it up!
The grains & money that Zamorin sent are over.
Okay! You may go now!
Where did the rice & grains disappear?
I boiled the grains & ate it.
We cannot leave like that.
Open that door!
Stop! Where are you going?
Move away!
Let me check. Move away!
Allah!
Get up and move!
This forest is our province hereafter.
How long can we hide in the forest like this, bhaijaan?
I'll tell you a story.
Listen.
to fight thousands of enemies,
the prophet marched to Medina with just 313 soldiers.
As an answer to the prophet,
above the palm trees,
After counting them,
nabi told the soldiers...
'Only 14 people would be martyred among us righteous people'
that was the answer that god gave nabi.
During twilight,
above the palm trees,
I also saw... many stars shining bright.
Those are you, children.
Those who see the tears of people who are in misery,
God will never give up on such people.
Come, everyone.
Look at that.
What is this?
Rice & grains at kappad beach.
From Kunjali. Take it.
Aimootty...
Didn't I ask you to go visit your wife and son?
Let it be time, brother.
It's not like that, aimootty.
But if something happens to you,
to cry and suffer,
Whatever troubles you may face, I'm there for you.
A ship is coming!
It's a Portuguese ship.
I had seen the flag.
Since it's really foggy, I couldn't see clearly.
Faster!
Mama!
Go, do your work.
No helping!
Enemy on board!
Thangudu!
Mama!
Hey! Drop your sword!
Otherwise I'll slit her throat!
Mama!
Partner! Where are you?
Aimootty!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
How did this happen?
...is really painful.
You should go and give this money to your sister-in-law.
Convince her that he died in an accident or something.
Bravo!
Slitting the opponent's throat without shedding even a drop of blood...
His younger brother achyuth ain't bad either.
Let the practice continue.
Say it softly. He has the ear of an elephant.
During the harvest in last January,
that rascal Kunjali stole 800 barrels of grains I brought from my warehouse.
He stole the goods you were about to sell the arabs for exorbitant prices,
To the left... to the left... Jump and attack.
You don't know anything, mangattachan.
That viceroy is really agitated.
Kolathiri was bigger than Zamorin's kozhikode once.
Don't forget that.
Puthumana, that was before your father koloth panicker...
...after losing the battle to mangattachan.
...the vigour and valiance of the kolathiri army has never diminished!
Please don't mind this, master.
Father and uncles keep boasting about themselves, wherever they go.
To discuss what has to be done to safeguard the country, when it is facing a threat.
Confine your talks to that topic.
This is a scheme by the Portuguese to infiltrate the Zamorin kingdom.
Once the army enters the country,
And that rascal stole that entire box of money!
I've never heard about Kunjali stealing even a penny...
...from anyone who behaves decently to other people.
It can be a penny... It can be millions...
If you can't capture him & slit his throat,
I will capture Kunjali and bring him to you!
Will anyone tell me...
Who is this Kunjali?
Those who have seen him, are not alive.
...fold their hands and bow to him!
...this ananth will tie up Kunjali and bring him in front of you!
They won't allow even the gods to enter there and touch him.
Well.. - No, your highness.
I will bring him here, before this lunar month is over.
Dead or alive.
No one needs to know how.
This is achyuth mangattachan's word.
The landlords can open their mouths after that.
...and offer your prayers there.
Partner! What's the name of this flat-nose?
Chang yui Yang. - What? What?
That name won't come out of my mouth.
Let us give him a name.
Chinali.
Chinali or thenali.
He won't understand all that.
Mama (mother)!
Mama!
I understood. - What?
Ask him to eat first.
Hey chinali!
Mama!
Hey!
Come on!
Oh my god!
Bloody monkey!
He's kicking like crazy!
He kicks really hard!
Move.
Let it be.
Mama!
Your mama...!!
Don't play in that water. You'll catch some disease.
Mama!
Mama!
My son! Where were you all this while?
Sister-in-law...
Do you understand anything that these Chinese people are saying?
I've brought their clothes, and some money in this.
You tell her, sister-in-law.
Let them do what they want.
I need to stop this business,
...build a beautiful house and surroundings,
...and then take you and abdu there.
Don't you need lots of money for that, moin kutty?
That has been arranged.
Just listen to what I say.
Your bag.
Kunja...!!
Did you see Kunjali?
No.
Then who sent this with you?
And gave this to me.
Salutations from Kunjali for the honourable his highness Zamorin.
...are not being served justice from their king...
...this Kunjali buckled up my belt and set forth to do that.
The day the struggling society of this country...
...does not befit your stature!
Also, please tell mangattachan that winning through betrayal...
If you feel that these words of mine reek of arrogance,
...please forgive this Kunjali.
From... Mammali alias Kunjali.
Shameless fellow!
...i don't think how it should be done.
Victory obtained through betrayal, is not part of kshatriya clan's ethics.
...is a coward!
Not a brave-heart!
You and ananth are equal to me.
But I'm a father who's proud about ananth.
I expect to feel the same about you too!
He might be a thief and a pirate.
There is something that is disturbing my mind.
What is it, father?
A great warrior like Kunjali...
You are archa, right?
I, alphonso de noronha,
captain and commander of the Portuguese Navy.
I'm here obeying the orders of the honourable viceroy francesco da gama...
...to personally bring you this scroll, your highness Zamorin.
Give me the message from viceroy.
Ships accompanied by 60 cannons,
...and around 6000 Navy men,
...will burn down the Zamorin's empire from kozhikode to kolathiri, together.
We will chop off Zamorin's head, and hang it below the Portuguese flag.
Before the upcoming full moon day,
...if you don't agree to our conditions,
...get ready for war.
From viceroy gama.
Such cruelty!
We needn't make any compromise with these culture-less devils!
Viceroy has decided to defeat us by humiliating and threatening us.
Whatever happens, we wouldn't yield to that.
If things happen as described in the scroll...
...will not be able to survive against the Portuguese ships!
We should remember that fact!
I'm not taking a hasty decision now.
Even before the Portuguese army sets foot on our coast,
...the Cannon balls that they shoot from the ships of their Navy,
Are you listening to me, father?
We won't be able to win this war, father.
He has a point.
Father...
I have an idea in my mind.
What is it?
Be it on land or at sea,
Yes.
So?
Kunjali...!!
Zamorins didn't rule this country for generations,
It is only because of the power that the people respectfully bestowed upon us,
...because of our legacy.
...was the selfless devotion of many mangattachans.
In war strategies,
That's exactly why...
...i am accepting mangattachan's suggestion regarding Kunjali.
The Zamorin palace doesn't need any association with the Portuguese.
Your highness,
It's an army that's 100 times stronger.
Yet, we fought bravely, without losing courage.
Pokkerali died on Kuttyali Marakkar's lap,
When I think about hoisting the Zamorin flag along with pattu Marakkar that day,
...i still feel proud!
...this royal court will lose its honour.
This land is like our mother.
If someone is ready to come forward to save our mother,
...however bad he may be,
...we can call him a great man.
The Zamorin empire had seen him only as an enemy until now.
But if we call him as a friend,
...he will come.
Go to sleep, boy!
He will come.
Kunjali will come.
How can you be sure about that?
Kunjali will come. Wait and watch!
What's happening there?
This is not Kunjali.
How do you know that?
'he is a shield for his friends'
'he lives the lives of many others'
Thank you for this honour bestowed upon me.
Kunjali...!!
Kunjali who might be present as smoke or wind, hidden in plain sight...
So... it was you?
Before seeing you in person,
But...
...about a Kunjali who chops ten heads with a single slash of the sword.
...to scare them and put them to sleep!
So are the people with me.
Since you have given me respect,
I have heard a lot about this palace.
We have seen each other somewhere, earlier.
Pattu?
Pattu Marakkar!
Yes, indeed!
...holding your hand and fighting by your side,
...long back, at the ponnani coast.
My dear friend, pattu.
For around 50 years,
...need not have that fear anymore.
...exchange his position,
The honour that I was invited here to receive,
...should be respectfully placed in my hand.
I am ananth mangattachan.
Commander of the infantry.
I honour Kunjali Marakkar with the position of the commander of our Navy.
That's him.
I had felt back then itself...
I have to inform something to everyone.
Kolathiri army won't take part in this war, under Kunjali.
This is beneath our dignity!
When rulers of local provinces became part of this empire...
...after losing to Zamorin and bowing down to him,
That their soldiers will accompany and serve the Zamorin army,
Don't you remember your father signing it, puthumana?
Then go ahead and chop it. Let's see!
Come on!
Chandroth, chop his head off!
When someone is insulting our entire family,
No one has taught me such a philosophy!
In whatever my parents and teachers have taught me,
...is selfishness, your highness!
Fighting on a war-field is not like hiding and stealing things.
Not just this Kunjali...
Even if all his dead ancestors come together,
...we cannot win this war against the Portuguese army.
...the Portuguese army will not set foot on Zamorin's land.
First, they will come posing as traders.
Then they will build churches and warehouses.
Not just the land and the women of this country...
...that would be our fate.
Whoever is coming with me, can follow me.
We will do that job!
Go and die!
How will you stop them?
Are you asking us to fight them with the few sticks and swords we have?
Oh god!
Thangudu!
We will win this war!
There is something there!
Give me your rifle.
Señor!
Sailing away.
Doesn't look like trouble.
Light the fire arrows!
Attack!
All cannons ready to fire!
Sabeera Raja... to the left!
Samudra Raja... To the right!
First and second sails, down!
Open up the stern sails!
All the sailors!
To the right!
Stern sail to the right!
Oars on the starboard!
To the left!
Fire the cannons!
Come on, start!
Fire the cannons!
...to see you in person.
Many years back...
Listening to the cries of my mother, whose throat you slit, tying her on to a pillar,
...among the corpses I killed,
Destiny brought us face to face,
...only today.
I will introduce you to some noblemen. Please come.
This is abubacker haji from thanoor.
Aren't you abu who used to sell coir at lal Mandi?
That's not me.
Hey! Just because you defeated the Portuguese by fluke somehow,
Then I'll throw you before them.
Are you mocking me?
If we had lost this war,
Achu...
Father and I, are proud about that fact.
'O dear lord krishna'
'o lord Govinda, who plays the flute'
'we are your people, you are our creator'
'o lord gopala, murari'
'O dear lord krishna'
'o lord Govinda, who plays the flute'
'we are your people, you are our creator'
'o lord gopala, murari'
Where is ananth?
You forgot someone, your highness.
Whom?
Chandroth panicker.
It's true.
Please come.
Your highness...
For you...
A special reward from me.
Your highness!
Granted!
'What are you thinking about, krishna?'
'for your happiness'
'come to me like the beautiful spring season'
'as the drops of the drizzling rain fall upon me'
'i am not myself.. I am lost somewhere, my beloved'
'my mind is swinging in the sky'
'come to me like the beautiful spring season'
'Where have you trapped me, performing magic tricks on me'
'throwing glances at me, you've captured me in your heart'
'I've never batted an eyelid ever since I saw you'
'oh dear god, how did you create such beauty?'
'i want to reside in your heart'
'i have become yours, this relationship is called love'
'as the drops of the drizzling rain fall upon me'
'i am not myself.. I am lost somewhere, my beloved'
'I am a honey bee in pursuit'
'the colours of the rainbow has come into our lives'
'our lives will be abundant with happiness'
'we shall live together forever, like the union of melody and rhythm'
'come to me like the beautiful spring season'
Father...
Father!
Father!!
I think we don't have to think any further.
That's right, father.
Without bothering about the superiority of the clan,
only when he had this desire.
You shouldn't break it, father.
Hold it.
Hold it!
I will fulfill it.
Smile!
Smile, I say!
Kunja...
What is it?
I saw a shadow.
Oh! That?
Come, I'll show you.
Partner!
Standing guard for you, until sunrise.
When he talks about you, he talks with pride!
Believe me!
How do you know that?
I am saying what I understood from his half-urdu, half-Chinese languages.
Whenever I close my eyes,
You carry on.
Thangudu...
That shadow I saw was not chinali's.
Long live the king!
Long live Kunjali!!
We are fixing achu's marriage.
Who's the girl?
Dharmoth panicker's daughter. Archa.
May god bless them.
Kunjali will let people out of the dining area,
I forgot to say something.
Managattachan, you should go to kolathiri urgently.
I heard rumors that they are engaged in some secret agreements with the Portuguese.
O goddess!
after the sunrise, there is an auspicious hour.
That will be suitable.
If the Zamorin falls,
All I expect is an exclusive trade!
In the present circumstance, none of this is possible.
We must wait until the situation turns favourable for us.
This is a gift.
But you can surely kill.
'K'
uncle...
You're lying.
No.
'kha'
listen...
If you don't mind,
Who?
Don't act like you don't know.
Kunjali...
Panicker...
Go and search everywhere!
Stop!
Cross this if you dare!
None of you will return alive!
We won't allow anyone to barge into houses with women & children in them.
Once we find him,
Wait & watch!
They both are in my house.
...after getting married.
They both haven't even changed the dry flower garlands on their necks.
Call him!
Wait.
Kunjali...!!
What has that devil done, uncle?
Kunjali...!!
Partner! No!
Almighty!
This pregnancy story!
Let mangattachan come back.
Your highness...
Ananth...
...and make him understand things.
What do you think?
Okay.
Go!
...by mere words.
I have never been dishonest to anyone till date.
I know.
...not a drop of blood should be shed anywhere.
I am begging you...
Give me permission.
...go ahead!
I'm sorry.
...my heart still trembles!
The ones who forgive and embrace those who admit their folly,
...are called humans.
Uncle!!
Achu!
How dare you touch my wife, you scoundrel?
You should listen to me!
You Chinese scoundrel!
No one will move without my permission!
Uncle!
Achu!
Brother!
She is my wife!
I will kill that dog who humiliated my wife!
Kunjali...!!
Ananth!
No!
Listen to me!
Traitor!
Archa!!
God!!
To those who can't respect words,
Kunjali...!!
Partner, no!
Stop it!
Move away!
They should rot!!
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I am a father...
...who is begging with folded hands, before the person who killed my own son.
...i need my son.
I know everything that happened there.
I am a kshatriya brahmin...
But for me...
...that there should be mutual respect, even between enemies?
I knew your father pokkarali.
He was a brave-heart.
He was fortunate enough to depart, without seeing his own son's death.
This sinner isn't that fortunate.
From the day he was born, till today...
Even though he failed in front of you,
If his soul that has departed his body needs to attain salvation,
To cremate him performing the last rites...
Otherwise,
...you will receive the curse of this old brahmin man.
This is ananth's promise!
No!
Traitor!
Listen to me!
I'm saying the truth!
Couldn't you tell me, uncle?
As if I didn't!
You attacked him like a mad animal!
One day...
Take him...
I shouldn't have sent ananth there.
Kunjali shall be punished for this.
...without realizing the truth and rectitude.
The greatest weight that a man can carry...
His own child's corpse.
I carried that.
I cannot do anything, anymore.
I am bidding farewell.
Mangattachan!
My dignity, pride, nobility and arrogance...
Wait!
Listen!
Mangattachan!
Your highness!
Your highness!
Your highness!
Come closer.
We must put an end to Kunjali's arrogance.
a trial should be conducted,
How dare you come here with such a letter?
They've declared you as a traitor!
what else should he do?
Sir...
...and made the face of kuthiravattom nair who took the elephant,
Do you still wish to hold Kunjali in such high regard, your highness?
If you are still adamant about it,
You had considered mangattachan's words to be holy until now, right?
Since he is as good as dead,
...you must listen to us also now.
Considering the welfare of the country,
...you should step down and take rest.
You have ruled enough!
Until you breathe your last,
Is this a decision made by everyone? - Yes.
If you obey,
...you will always have this position and respect.
That's all we have to say, as of now.
Go!
O goddess!
I, Andre furtado de mendonca,
I'm here to hand over this token of honour...
...from the viceroy Francisco da gama,
Not just that...
...for the Portuguese to build churches and warehouses here,
What is this?
Son...
...by betraying the people!
It's not for war.
This compromise is for peace.
Come!
For his arrogance towards the royal law,
This is also to inform that...
...achyuth mangattachan has been appointed...
Third battalion to tents 10 to 15.
Francisco da gama,
I have come with an army of 6000 men,
...cavalry and artillery...
...to stop the atrocities...
...of Kunjali Marakkar forever.
I want his face...
...at my feet!
Dead or alive!
Continue!
We will attack him with the combined forces...
...of the Portuguese and Zamorin armies...
...till the fort falls.
Instead..
Achu and dharmoth panicker had mentioned this to me.
It's dangerous to let Kunjali grow any further.
This should be nipped in the bud.
I am ready to stand with Zamorin and the Portuguese army.
Kolathiri army is not ready!
Kolathiri army is not ready to wag our tails, listening to the Portuguese!
Come!
Isn't chandru the commander of kolathiri army?
As far as the army is concerned, his word is final.
Take it.
Take this.
before coming here, chandroth?
Yes.
If you agree...
Kolathiri army will join you, Kunjali.
the Portuguese army will take away all the crops!
They won't spare even a seed to sow!
before the people who came to loot this country, in the name of trade!
In front of the Portuguese and Zamorin armies who come with guns and swords,
you can live happily!
You can live,
seeing your daughters cleaning up their houses.
And when your blue-eyed grandchildren born to the Portuguese,
call you 'grandfather' in Portuguese language,
And then, one day...
You will fall dead somewhere.
grabbing everything that you get,
come with me!
I will come.
I will come!
We are with you!
We are with you!
We will come!
We are with you!
Kunja...
Uncle...
Yesterday, during the night...
all the shining stars had disappeared.
The Zamorin and Portuguese armies have begun setting up camp outside.
After this battle...
I am talking about the truth that the prophet saw.
Leaving me behind on this earth,
Then, until I die...
I trust you.
That's why I'm showing you this path.
Look at my army.
All you have is a stream.
I'll give you one last chance to surrender...
...and give up your fort.
Your men will live...
If you refuse,
and the consequences will be dire.
What's he saying?
If you step inside the fort,
You shouldn't go wrong!
What's he saying?
What's he saying?
He says...
What's he saying?
Zamorin infantry!
Zamorin...
Second battalion!
Full attack!
Pull it!
Pull it!
Artillery!
Our army is amongst them.
Our army is here.
Let those pigs die!
We need to face them strongly!
Remember!
The enemy shouldn't reach this side.
Fire!
Charge!
Everyone, go inside.
Cavalry!
Artillery!
Come!
Be careful! Come!
You are the chaff who was born to mangattachan!
I killed the one who deserved to do it, unknowingly.
As a penance for that mistake,
Get lost!
Kunjali is dead!!
Kunjali...!!
Kunjali!
Kunjali...!!
Kunjali...!!
You traitor!!
You still have time to kill me.
Before anyone comes to know...
Partner!
Partner!
Welcome, everyone.
The crowd seems to be diminishing, as time goes by.
Every day...
Instead, we should kill ten of his men who are in our gallows, every day...
Shoot them dead!
I am not ready to stain the royal legacy...
to take vengeance against Kunjali.
Yes.
The king is always right.
Would you?
Or you?
Or you?
For our country...
His order...
But there's always someone above...
...the king.
The almighty.
The god.
Here, I am god.
And I've decided!
the hundreds of prisoners of war who supported Kunjali...
...have been sentenced to death by the judiciary.
Guns in position.
Fire!
Drop the guns!
It's time...
I've been expecting this arrival for many days.
They were exploiting it.
For that crime...
I shall release the viceroy.
But I will only meet his highness Zamorin himself.
Chandroth will come and take you.
You should repeat whatever I said, to his highness.
no one should be brought along.
I know whatever you're doing is not right.
Yet I'm committing this betrayal.
I decided to do this.
Mother!
Uncle is here!
My mother prayed to the almighty to protect me, and gave this to me.
It will protect him hereafter.
Zubaida...
Though unknowingly...
Listen!
Don't go!
Listen!
Stop! Don't go!
Your highness...
People are always victims of circumstances.
You, me and everyone else.
You shouldn't think that you don't have anyone.
One word from your heart...
...that Kunjali should be with you.
I will chase those Portuguese rats away, from this country!
No!
Kunjali!
...the sentence for a capital event.
But, if Marakkar pleads guilty of his accusations,
the punishment may be diluted.
I hereby sentence...
...Kunjali Marakkar to death..
...by guillotine, the French way.
My lord!
One last chance.
Beg for mercy...
...to the king of Portugal...
...and save yourself from death.
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
...so the king can hear it with his ears.
Say it!
End him!
Make him face the blade!
Let him see his death coming!
Almighty!
Save my country!
'Tell these awakened eyes where you are'
'make the cool breeze a lullaby'
'teach him to sleep like you'
'my dear child'
'Kunjali, your name shall live on forever'
'Kunjali, your name shall live on forever'
'Kunjali, your name shall live on forever'
'Kunjali, your name shall live on forever'
One...
two...
three...
Give me the revolver! I also want to play.
Children.
Say something, otherwise they'll stay like this until tomorrow.
Sorry, love, I hate being the grumpy admiral
When I'm at home.
Let's do it like this, Admiral: try to calm the crew
Hey, sailor, stop bothering your sister,
otherwise I will take away your position as vice-dad.
Good morning.
Bom...
You can't stop from one day to the next.
Pronto.
All good?
No.
Right.
ENRICO: BETTER TO WAIT SITTING DOWN.
FLAVIO: THEN GET HARD. I AUTHORIZE.
Come here...
Stop this!
Right. I got all pissed off with vampires.
And this Claudia?
Claudia is just like what you see on social media.
She's cocky, but she's nice when she wants to be.
Perry Mason is a favorite among them.
I'll have to remember the subjunctive...
And there? What it is?
Wait one moment.
Look there.
Look how wonderful!
Being content is the 1st step to unhappiness, girl.
When you play the wise old man...
I am.
What is that?
Yes, there's still Enrico's girlfriend.
Oh no, my love...
Enrico is arriving with the little girl.
I'm about to call the police for child solicitation.
With or without you.
- Welcome! - We're here!
Our...
It's getting old, man.
So as to...
Do not mind. He always plays the asshole.
The entire universe spins...
around a skirt tail.
Damn.
- Careful, this is prehistoric. - So cute!
Were they already dating here?
No, I was waiting for you.
Come, I want to show you something.
Come, come, come.
How wonderful!
How about locking the door?
Oh, shit...
Come here.
It's rude, especially when you're invited.
Relax, my love.
- What's up, little couple? - Look at them!
What's up, handsome?
hope
You look beautiful!
At least the girl gave something back.
- And you've already settled in, haven't you? - How beautiful you are...
- Welcome to my yacht! - I wish you...
Don't be cretins.
Why does everyone always want to drive?
Get out of there! As for jealousy, it seems like a child.
My God, it's so jealous...
How many non-alcoholic piÃ±a coladas did Enrico drink?
Like this?
Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen for him.
has a big heart.
Baby, I'm going to fall too.
Go, Flavio!
Come on sunga!
Take it all!
Congratulations!
- All good. - Sit there.
because I wanted to show how well he pilots the yacht and so on,
He always had chambermaids and maids.
When we camped, he didn't even wash.
Maybe this sponge cake here...
It's Enrico's birthday. Is important.
Well, I'm not teetotal. He sends.
A toast.
To Enrico,
the sincere friend that everyone should be lucky to have in this life.
- Congratulations my friend. - Health!
He arrives. Gift.
Look how wonderful!
Now stop using that Chinese rubbish.
Vaca!
Fede, we give ours down there.
Happy birthday.
It's a contract.
There's just one thing missing:
your signature.
It's 10 thousand euros per month, plus benefits.
Company car, paid trips, health insurance.
But?
In reality, I came to propose a business to you.
Sorry about the resort. I know they lost money.
We want to protect you.
From what?
To take a step bigger than your leg again.
Why?
Why am I not like you?
Look, let's do this.
I'll think about it a little, okay?
Okay, but don't take too long.
Enough talking about work. You've already had your fill.
Listen, I wanted to know something important.
I'll talk later, okay?
It's not possible.
What it was?
Love what happened?
Good morning.
What it was?
Federico! Federico!
Mal.
Someone came aboard.
Where's Claudia?
Claudia!
What is happening? Flavio!
Flavio?
Flavio, stop for a moment.
hey wait
Wait, damn it.
Look... the boat is gone.
Flavio, what happened?
and sabotaged the desalination plant.
And now?
We are adrift,
no food and no water.
Everyone was passed out.
Just drinks and some weed?
Federico,
What was in those joints?
Herb. The usual marijuana.
Still, I didn't smoke and he didn't drink.
The only logical explanation is that we were drugged.
The strange thing is... I understand stealing from us,
You're right, it's weird.
Things like that don't happen in this area.
I think it's something political.
Maybe it's a prank on me.
Enough of this nonsense!
Stay calm.
We have to prepare ourselves for when another boat passes
Shit...
- A radio that no one has seen before? - Answer, exchange.
Wasn't the radio broken?
This is Broken Wave.
Shall I speak to the commander? Exchange.
Affirmative, exchange.
I understand. It happens...
Nobody is kidding. We were robbed.
We've been adrift for a day. Exchange.
It's off the trade routes. There are dangerous currents.
How soon can it reach us?
and take us to the nearest port.
Maybe it's like this in your perfect sailor's manual,
How do you know my name?
Elena Caetani, Claudia Argan,
Federico Colonna, Martina Zaccone
and especially you, Enrico Cerci.
Claudia, do you want to add me on social media?
Always looking for followers...
May I know who we are talking to?
You can call me Emilio.
Emilio, as "The Black Corsair", by Salgari.
Okay, Emilio, what the fuck do you want?
I wanted to know how they were.
They must be feeling tired, confused.
Some may be experiencing drug withdrawal effects
Like I said, you're off the beaten track,
then no one will come to the rescue.
And your families won't send anyone to look for you.
to let you know that everything is ok
and that the holidays are great.
A person can go days without eating. Then no.
At least, not yet.
Oh, Flavio.
Hello...
An experienced sailor,
I didn't think he was so naive.
As you can see, I'm not naive,
I think I deserve a little more of your attention. What do you say?
Okay, Emilio, we're listening.
I want to talk to Enrico.
I am here. I'm Enrico, exchange.
Just six numbers.
The current account password and transfer code.
I'm not talking about the account where you keep your change.
You know.
I'm talking about the other account, the Luxembourg one,
where they are currently deposited
Chat better with your friends.
The walkie-talkie battery should last another 48 hours.
We pay even more! Let me call my dad.
What is this about Luxembourg?
In fact, I don't think it's his.
It's ours, but we thought it was lost.
He screwed you.
I said we shouldn't trust him,
but you didn't listen to me. He looked like a swindler.
On the other hand,
the best way for a thief to hide
It's pretending it was stolen.
in some mafioso back home from his father.
But the guy isn't a jerk like you two
But he's just mad at Enrico!
He had to pay for the scam and got us involved.
It's not possible. She's right.
It has nothing to do with Kenya.
Don't come with this class struggle nonsense!
You are a thief!
Listen, Federico, I messed up there in Kenya. I agree.
Right. But first: don't you dare call me a thief.
Second:
How many times?
Are you silent now? Is everyone quiet?
Just to clear your shitty conscience.
I'm not a thief, Martina.
I'm not a thief.
You!
Look, Enrico...
I don't care about Kenya. It's just between us.
Nobody will know.
Well, the code is...
874521.
Very good. And now the code for the transfer. Exchange.
040878.
Hey, Martina, come here.
Come here, come here.
I have nothing to do with it. I didn't steal anything.
Disappearing with a million of your friends is what?
The money was available.
I just wanted to build something myself.
Broken Wave, listening? Exchange.
Broken Wave, listening?
We're here. Enrico listening.
Good news, Enrico.
The transfer has been completed.
To the south... Where is the south?
That wasn't fair, man!
The choice is yours.
Who knows, maybe they won't learn to deserve things?
Does it take a while to go swimming?
He is the best swimmer. Sorry, but that's right.
No, Elena is right. It's too risky.
What is more,
He couldn't even do it under normal conditions.
He is well.
Now let's vote.
Who agrees that Enrico goes?
- It's decided. - I go.
It's not my fault? So I go.
I don't run away from my responsibilities.
It's going in the wrong direction.
The boat is moving away.
Breathe! Look...
Or.
He comes!
Federico!
It's been 15 years.
He left the field because he was very poor,
but he ended up being poor in the city too.
"Poverty brings out the worst in human beings," he said.
He introduced me to important people.
I'm sorry for involving you in this story.
No.
I'm scared, Fede.
Flavio will make it.
I'm sure.
When all this is over,
for our grandchildren.
If you think about it, it's a fantastic story.
Six friends at sea,
on a drifting yacht,
Damn, it works!
I'm already thinking about the soundtrack.
Us, as always.
Hemingway!
What did Emilio say when Flavio wanted to locate him?
Which, when pointing the binoculars, ended up revealing himself.
Exactly! Hemingway's heliograph!
Elena, go and rest.
It is an instrument capable of sending Morse signals over a distance!
We just need the Sun and two mirrors.
They were discovered and ended up slaughtered.
Help me.
My father just did his job.
Every accused has the right to the best possible defense.
And we just wanted to defend our friend.
What else are friends for?
Emilio,
try to analyze the situation.
A boat could appear at any moment.
What will happen?
Nobody is hurt
Why do you always have to talk about money?
I thought you were smarter, lawyer.
It's a negotiation, isn't it?
And you will do exactly what I say.
It has to work.
Of course it works.
Guys, listening? It's Flavio.
My love!
Elena,
go to our cabin and look for a DVD.
Watch with everyone.
He wants to screw us!
He arrives.
I already did what you wanted.
Now let me go.
Go. Go.
Untie me.
Or.
Where?
Where? Is not here!
Here, here, here. I found.
Let's go.
Calm down, Elena. I got it. Calm.
Wedding ring...
- It stinks, take that DVD out. - Why?
- Please. I'm asking. - Why? Keep calm.
What? What is it...?
What the fuck?
I love you.
Enough, man. Let's go.
Leave me. What the fuck?
What rubbish is this, Claudia?
Claudia?
With my best friend.
Pardon me! Pardon me!
I'm sorry, Fede.
Fuck you, fuck you...
And, you, let go of me!
Elena.
Elena.
He who is right doesn't win.
The smartest one wins!
Go, Flavio, go!
Elena, listen.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
I swear.
I'm asking for forgiveness.
No! No...
No, no... my love...
Claudia, breathe. Breathe, my love.
Breathe, my love, please. Please breathe.
My love...
All I wanted was for...
Wedding ring!
It stinks! It stinks, help!
Wedding ring!
Wedding ring.
Wedding ring!
Please, Fede!
and then dedicate it to the service of all humanity
Don't you think this little offense would be canceled
It's from "Crime and Punishment."
"For one life, thousands of lives saved
One death,
in exchange for hundreds.
Old Fyodor...
Incomparable.
Culpa...
and punishment.
The book...
talk about guilt
And redemption.
I am here to bring divine justice.
They. Hey, Elena.
Look, a boat.
It's a boat.
We're saved, damn it!
Shit...
Shit! Shit!
Hey! We're here!
Elena! Elena, we are saved!
No...
Elena, what is it?
Elena?
What the fuck, Elena? Get down!
No!
Cum!
Hi, Donkey.
Hi, Donkey. All very well?
Now it is.
How do we deal with the unexpected?
Leave it to me, don't worry.
We're almost there.
Right. I'm listening.
You were that girl...
Yeah, I know.
Daddy told you not to cry.
Do you hear the siren?
Here, stupid. You can stay.
Stay calm. I am here.
Mommy!
- Good evening, sir. - Goodnight.
We saw a Morse Code SOS coming from here.
We came to check.
You did well.
But it is no longer necessary.
We received the report
and the rescue operation was immediately activated.
- Let's take care of everything. - Is really everthing fine?
Because that doesn't seem to be standard procedure.
Even though it's against the rules?
And finally,
They were retired a long time ago.
Everything is under control, my lord.
Stop wasting my time.
Do not move.
Emilio, don't do that. Don't do that!
Pare!
No!
No... don't do that!
Are you listening?
Emilio!
I'm sorry, Stupid. I had no choice.
Martina, you are two murderers.
Victims.
Hey, you kid!
Men.
Men?
Shit.
Hi, Donkey.
That's it, leave the bag there.
Take off the coat.
Look, look, take it.
Ready. Now, sit there.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you bring everything?
Pronto.
He finished. I took everything.
That's what the very rich do.
You were the other kid in the car with her.
We're not alike, are we?
Emilio and Martina.
From your parents.
What difference does?
What if I was?
You are crazy.
Any psychiatrist would agree.
But believe me...
With everything we've been through, it would be strange otherwise.
We were the happiest children in the world.
The happiest.
And then, suddenly...
where we saw our parents agonize and die.
Don't cry, little one.
Everything is fine.
It was an endless hour,
even though the OR said that help arrived in 7 minutes.
Go get help, sailor.
Socorro!
Socorro!
Socorro!
Since we had no relatives, we ended up in an orphanage.
But I guarantee it looked like something from a Dickens book.
We were finally adopted.
a certain tendency towards sadism.
This is how psychopaths come into the world.
We wanted to destroy your perfect world.
It was our father's fault,
because I wasn't wearing glasses that day.
And from the police's conclusions,
considered inadmissible due to formal defects.
who said the ambulance only arrived an hour later.
With Flavio's father defending you,
I wasn't even there that night, Martina.
Only members and close relatives could enter.
I was not there.
I was just their kids' poor friend.
I lived 15 minutes down the road.
Nobody had been there yet.
after drinking so much,
he would never get out of jail.
All his father's money wouldn't save him.
It's just that I...
I am teetotal.
I never drink.
What is more,
It was guaranteed.
I stayed there.
It was simple...
and I accepted.
Martina, forgive me.
But I didn't kill your parents.
Well, now we kill them both.
You told him everything, asshole!
Do you know what I always liked about your films, Federico?
What do my films have?
the villain always wins.
- And? - Ask yourself a question.
We are saved.
What is happening?
Emilio!
I'm leaving!
You understood?
No no! No!
You are ready?
GOOD DAYS
But I didn't.
I'm not doing this for you!
Go home.
Mummy.
I know.
Understand? Get lost.
Who are you guys?
Uncle... I am Rinku.
It tastes synthetic.
And this is...
Get to the point, bro.
Take it out.
Tiffin.
I simply picked up what had fallen on the ground.
Aunty...
The pretty and innocent girl who'd got our stuff out.
I told her myself.
How did she get our address?
You're mistaken.
Send her in.
and said, "Jasmine...
-Who is it? -Never mind.
Check properly.
Madam...
No...
You're a good man.
Sir?
you're a shrewd and--
Hello, my child?
No problem.
-I'm not going. -Leave!
-My family... -No.
What if I don't?
Please let us go.
What is this?
<i>♪ Dancing like there's no tomorrow ♪</i>
We'll all die!
With me.
Yes.
Jerry, ask him to give me another chance!
Please let them go.
Jerry madam, please give him the address.
No...
You are a good boy.
Sir...
<i>Then get them here.</i>
Jaya...
Where?
<i>A new world awaits once you conquer your fears.</i>
And what are you gonna do when one of those psychos finds us?
Hey, the deaf girl's trying to say something.
Look, we need to pick a direction and stick to it.
Are you crazy? What about the bear traps?
but just try to stay on the path.
- That could work. - What about the psychos?
What about them? We just took one out.
We still don't know what the red means.
For all we know, we're going further into the maze.
It's okay. We're gonna get out of this maze.
and two of us have already been killed.
I think we're right here, and I'm thinking
hanging around didn't help save them.
Which means they're heading in the same direction
If they figure out we're behind them,
they'll just turn around and chase us down.
Do you really wanna leave them here awake?
And it's still not enough.
Of course we told them.
Beyond that, we're out of business.
Was that on purpose?
I'll do my job,
Sorry, I'll be at the bank in 10 minutes.
Well, if all goes well...
- Grégoire, it's Charles. - Yes, Charles?
<i>- You still driving?</i> <i>- Yeah.</i>
Be careful!
I know, I know...
Why are you calling, Charles?
You can't pay me back, is that it?
Shit!
I'm such a jerk!
<i>Hello, you've reached</i> <i>Daniel's voicemail.</i>
Daniel, it's me.
Thanks.
You'll make a tidy sum!
<i>Want it?</i> <i>Otherwise, I'll give it to Sam.</i>
No, I'll take it.
<i>- You sure?</i> <i>- Positive. What's the address?</i>
<i>123 Quai de la Marne.</i> <i>Madeleine Keller.</i>
You're welcome.
121...
First of all, I'm not deaf.
Plus, I'm ready.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm coming.
Yes, I know.
Well...
and the whole machine goes on the blink!
Now the doctors won't let me live alone anymore.
They think I'd be better off in an institution
with medical or specialized supervision. Whatever...
Anyway, it's no joke.
I'm not happy. That's not what I wanted.
No idea... Eighty?
Or else you need glasses.
I'm 92 years old.
- Really? - Really.
Not bad, huh?
Yeah.
You don't look it.
I was born just before the war.
But that's so far away.
Boy, is it far...
Do you know Vincennes?
That's where I was born and grew up.
Sure.
I know.
I'd love to see my old neighborhood.
Okay.
Yes, I think it's that way.
Okay? Can we go now?
It's ugly. I don't recognize a thing.
Okay.
Oh, no, not that.
I must've been 10 or 11.
André's the one who pushed me.
But I forgave André immediately.
Because I had a crush on him!
No, the first man I kissed
There were dances everywhere!
What a party it was!
And Matt and I danced all night long.
Honey and orange.
What a marvel!
And you?
Excuse me?
See what I mean?
No, I don't remember.
My goodness...
I told you mine, you can certainly tell me yours.
Half my age.
You could be my grandson.
You know what my father always said?
Each moment of anger ages you.
So, there!
I know.
I've known it quite well.
Yes.
Charles...
Is that your name? I'm not mistaken?
Yeah.
<i>Here, H. Mounier, L. Keller &</i> <i>A. Marazzi were executed by Nazis</i>
I was mad at the whole world.
Fortunately,
the Americans landed a few days later.
And among those Americans,
there was Matt.
Your first kiss. Honey and oranges.
See? You are listening to me!
That's sweet.
Sixteen years old. My God!
Mad love!
Mad, but too short.
Much too short. Three short months.
And I stayed here.
But those days...
The promises!
I never saw Matt again. Never again.
Yet, I could never forget him.
Never.
I still think of him.
He never knew it.
But before he shoved off, he left me a wonderful gift.
What kind of gift?
Nineteen and a half inches.
Mathieu,
my son.
No choice.
There's an accident ahead.
Anyway, take your time.
I'm in no hurry.
You know that.
Hold on!
Fuck!
It's because of that jerk!
Do you take anything, like the occasional tranquilizer?
I spend my life in this taxi.
It drives you crazy, in the end.
Six days a week.
And what do I make?
By the time I pay
for the lease on the car
and all the expenses...
Change jobs.
I've thought about it!
I'm my own boss, nobody tells me what to do.
And when I don't feel like talking, I clam up.
So I'm in luck today!
The problem is
Who you never even see.
Once, I dropped off a guy in front of his house
and told him the fare was 55 euros.
The guy taps me on the shoulder
"I only have 50. Could you back up a little?"
Think that's funny?
What did you do?
I backed up.
I backed up.
The Avenue Parmentier!
No, thanks, don't bother.
My mother was a dresser
It was called the...
The Splendid...? The Splendor!
Do you like theater?
Karine and I can't even go to the movies. So the theater...
What a shame.
You know, the theater
is another world.
Ever since I was little,
I loved it there.
The lights,
the elegant women on opening night...
<i>Rehearsing their lines</i> <i>up to the very last minute!</i>
I moved heaven and earth
to try to find Matt.
I wrote hundreds of letters.
But he was already married.
Madeleine!
I never contacted him again.
- The dress is too long. - Let's see.
I keep stepping on it.
Madeleine will fix it.
Who's asking?
Look at that outfit! It's indecent!
The movies.
I can't watch Mathieu every time.
I warn you.
Thanks, Mom.
Madam, Mr. Deventroux is here.
See him in.
Come here.
Come here!
What flavor?
Excuse me?
His kisses. What flavor?
I've decided not to remember.
Know it?
Sorry...
Still, it's wild!
We lived right there.
Look what's there now!
Life really is full of imagination.
This kid's exhausting!
Please, don't blame him.
It's not his fault if he's between us.
Bring your plate here, honey.
We have to get up, too?
Have fun with your bastard son.
I'm sure you have lots to talk about.
Eat, sweetheart.
You're not eating, Mom?
I'm not too hungry.
What's a "bastard"?
You're drunk again.
- Stop! - Whose fault is that?
Stop!
Go to bed, sweetheart. It's nothing.
Mommy slipped.
Go on. I'll come kiss you goodnight.
Let's see.
It's not too bad.
It's the kid's fault.
Doesn't it drive you crazy?
Look at me.
I didn't mean to hurt you, I swear.
If you'd just make an effort.
You're better off here, taking care of us.
Like before.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop!
Stop, Ray.
Stop!
Take it easy!
Mommy, I'm home!
Hi, honey. Got any homework?
No, I'm fine.
Hurry up.
It's nothing.
It'll go away.
Mathieu, come here!
Don't be afraid.
He'll never hurt you.
Mathieu!
What tips?
Don't play dumb! The one on the table.
I didn't touch it.
Think I can't count now?
I swear, it wasn't me.
Did I ask your opinion?
Now I can't count?
That's not what I said.
No, Ray...
Let her go!
You're crazy! Sweetheart...
That makes me crazy!
Mathieu's 7 years old, Ray!
If he lived with your mother, things would be different!
Go rinse your face with cold water. I'll be right in.
I'll take Mathieu to my mother's.
We'll spend the evening together.
Just you and me.
And did you?
What do you think?
You'd better believe it!
He beats you, he beats your son...
The "night" would be an exaggeration.
Ray?
Come closer.
Not drinking?
Wait, I'll bring you another.
Forget it. I've got a better proposition.
You okay?
Yeah.
What's happening to...
What's happening...
Ray?
Ray!
<i>My mother always</i> <i>had trouble sleeping.</i>
But, uh...
No.
You kill when you love.
Back in those days,
you couldn't get a divorce for domestic violence.
People didn't get divorced at all. Or hardly ever.
He pressured me so much
to have his child. But I didn't want to.
I already had my Mathieu.
who was quite enough for me.
When he hit Matt's son, I don't know,
It made my blood boil.
Hi. Can you hear me?
I'm whispering because I have a fare who's dozing.
Pretty? Yeah, a pretty fare who's 92 years old.
I'm sorry about this morning.
I even left Daniel a message.
See?
Yeah.
Is Betty okay?
She didn't wake up this morning?
Good.
I've gotta go. Traffic's moving.
I'll call back when my ride's done.
Karine!
I love you.
That Karine...
I woke you?
Oh, no!
What do you think?
At my age, if you fall asleep,
you may never wake up!
and mother of my daughter, Betty.
Betty. What a pretty name!
How did you meet?
In high school.
But for me, memories...
That I know.
Memories aren't your thing.
But that comes with age, you'll see!
We're domestic partners.
with a bunch of old geezers even older than I am.
Holy cow!
Well, with this kisser and my elephant ears, it was no cinch!
Every one!
To take her home,
But she...
She'd give a polite smile and get on the bus.
That made them crazy.
No. No, but...
I had an Agfamatic 2000.
What's that?
screwed up all my courage and sat next to her.
I asked if I could photograph her gaze.
A photographer...
Tell me about her gaze.
It was her eyes that I fell for. Totally!
And when I showed her the photos,
We've had our ups and downs, like all couples.
Know what you are?
And who's Daniel?
Oh, Daniel...
He's my brother.
But we've never been on the same wavelength.
He's a doctor and I'm...
Exactly.
And you and your wife...
What the fuck?!
- Take it easy! - No apologies?
Those fucking scooters!
Charles...
I'm about to aggravate you again.
Yes.
Sure!
- Careful. - Are you in pain? Your legs?
I'm fine.
- Hurry! - Sure.
After you.
Hello.
The ladies' room, please?
It's urgent.
It won't take long.
My goodness!
Take it easy!
Get outta the way!
Okay, we're going.
Everything's fine.
Move!
Move your damn taxi!
Go!
You said it!
Thank you, Charles.
No problem. It's only normal.
Can I bum one?
I haven't smoked in 30 years.
Nothing can hurt me now.
I'm a cab driver, I remind you!
It's the Conciergerie.
The courthouse.
Yes.
Ray didn't die.
You know, the '50s weren't like today.
or even to open a bank account.
Can you imagine...
burning his balls off?
The courthouse was a mob scene.
Officers of the court,
please remove the people in the hall,
Mrs. Haguenau...
My question is the following...
My husband?
A man
He's a torturer.
I didn't want to kill Raymond.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have called the ambulance.
My son and I were in danger, Your Honor.
The Court calls Raymond Haguenau.
Raymond Haguenau.
Come forward.
a.k.a. Ray, a welder by profession?
That's me.
I swear.
The defendant, here present, claims that you hit her.
Is that true?
Some are so hard-headed.
We've been married for five years.
How are you today?
Mr. Haguenau, you asked for a closed session,
under article 306 of the criminal procedure code,
on acts of torture and barbarity.
Speak without fear. We're listening.
His seducing days are over, he'll never have kids
and that's great news for humanity.
Silence! You don't have the floor.
Officers, please...
Did you appeal?
No.
Back then, you couldn't appeal a decision of the Assizes Court.
But 25 years is criminal!
No, it was the '50s.
Well...
Don't throw out the baby with the bath water. No!
It was great. For example,
we zipped around on Vespas...
We wore skirts that showed our knees.
And we listened to jazz everywhere!
You'd have really loved the fifties!
Yeah, maybe...
And your son? What did he think?
Oh, fuck!
Shit!
What?
I think I ran a red light.
Police. You went through a red light.
No, sir, it was yellow.
- License and registration, please. - Be nice...
Your papers.
Fuck, he's gonna give me shit!
I have something important to say.
I work like a dog, day after day.
My life's over.
- Insurance. - It was yellow!
Insurance.
Please!
- Thank you. - Please!
Charles, dear,
could you leave me alone with the young lady?
Think about that next time.
Get going!
He's taking me to my cardiologist for an operation. It's my last chance.
Given the results of my last EKG...
You know, miss, we're so close.
That would be so nice, miss.
I could've been an actress!
Thank you.
Thank you, Charles!
Betty loves vanilla ice cream.
I love it, too.
It was the only thing that had any taste.
I have to say, I had been good.
I had left a child
You're handsome.
You must have some things to say to me.
I haven't seen you much.
It bummed me out to see you in jail.
I understand.
So...
How's school going?
When you make choices in life, you need the courage to assume them.
And what should I know?
Did you take them?
Yes.
All of them?
Your degree? College?
That was just to please you, but it's not what I want in life.
I'm a photographer. You can see that.
I work for the Gamma agency and...
And?
I leave in two weeks.
So, I...
Everything I did, I did for you, Mathieu.
For me?
Think it was easy being Madeleine Keller's son?
I was in prison, too.
I'm taking off because I need to breathe.
Understand? To breathe.
Mathieu...
Sweetheart.
They called me on April 10.
It was the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Six months after he left.
That day, I was mad at the whole world, once again.
So mad...
given that I'm still around, at 92.
And Ray?
What about Ray?
Yes.
Paris Match organized a big ceremony
to be in the photographs.
When I saw that, I made them cancel everything. Everything!
And it was good.
It's my fault. I lost track of time.
Yes, indeed.
Mrs. Keller was expected at 3 o'clock.
I'm really sorry.
Charles,
Mrs. Keller? I can hear you.
<i>You must come now.</i> <i>We're waiting for you.</i>
Everyone's already had dinner.
<i>If all the residents were like you,</i> <i>it would be a free-for-all.</i>
You're right, Madam.
Exactly! So...
- Mado... - Will you be here soon?
Feel like pigging out?
<i>What?</i> <i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>
I'm going into a tunnel. Hello, hello...
Really? We're gonna pig out?
One day, I gave my daughter a treat.
Well, one night.
Just before Christmas, two years ago.
Betty wanted to see Paris - the lights...
Then we went down the Champs-Elysées.
We did Boulevard Haussmann, the department stores.
And the Place Vendôme.
The most beautiful in the world.
- Her mother's eyes! - Yes.
Thanks to my daughter,
I saw a Paris I was no longer able to see.
Every year, I cover three times the circumference of the Earth.
I don't have one memory to hang onto. Not one.
I've never even been out of France.
I drove a guy to Brussels, during the train strike.
But Brussels...
that's not really abroad.
Pitiful, isn't it?
Still, we do have my wife's family home.
In the country.
- Where? - In Picardy.
She's a nurse.
- A nurse? - Yeah.
Why "something else"?
Think I dine like this with all my fares?
That'd make a lot of meals!
You're funny.
Hello, Daniel?
No.
I don't wanna get rude.
Have you finished?
- Everything okay, Charles? - Fine, and you?
- Fine. - Good.
- It's great here. - Absolutely.
- Was everything okay? - Yes, thank you.
- Please... - No, it's my pleasure.
- Please. - It's my pleasure.
You saved my license. It's the least I can do.
No, I'd be delighted.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It's been ages since I strolled on a man's arm.
Really?
Well, I'm touched.
Very. Very lovely.
It's done me good.
Let's go, Charles.
Help me out.
Good evening.
Madeleine Keller. I'm expected.
Okay, I'll send the nurse.
Mrs. Keller?
That's me, not him.
One suitcase.
I've never taken a seat in a chair like that.
And I'm not starting tonight.
This way, ma'am. Come with us.
- Charles... - Yes.
I didn't pay for the ride.
Don't worry. I'll come back, okay?
- We'll settle up another time. - Okay.
Goodbye, Charles.
She was a star!
An icon.
She still owes me for the ride.
Come along, I'd like you to meet her.
She'd like that. I talked about you a lot.
She has no family.
What's the matter?
I put my parents' house on the market yesterday.
My sister finally agreed.
We have to pull through.
We have to face up to things.
Given how rarely we go on vacation...
now we can go somewhere nice, for a change.
It'll do us good.
Did you tell Betty?
No. Not yet.
It'll be fine.
Hello.
We're here to visit Madeleine Keller.
She arrived late last week.
Yes, I know.
Didn't anyone contact you?
What?
She had severe heart problems.
Her heart gave out.
What's her room number?
But, sir, it's no use...
No, she has to meet my wife.
Please, it's very important. I want to introduce my wife.
- Charles... - I beg you.
Room 39.
But it's really...
Sir, wait!
Charles...
Hello...
- Are you Charles Hoffman? - Yes.
- The cab driver? - Yes.
I have this for you.
My condolences. Have a nice day.
My dear Charles,
it means I'm no longer here.
And that's the way it's meant to be.
<i>Tonight, I'm looking at the photos</i> <i>that have been with me</i>
throughout all these years.
<i>They speak</i> <i>of the people I've so loved.</i>
Last night,
The next day,
you end your days in an old folks' home,
It all goes by in a flash.
<i>was the last happy moment</i> <i>of my life.</i>
A lovely ride, as you say.
Stay the ugly duckling that you are.
Take off, Charles.
<i>go on a vacation.</i> <i>Far, very far...</i>
Farewell, Charles.
I don't really need it.
Look.

He says it does.
Or what?
are partying in Vegas, not driving eight hours
to the heart of buttfuck nowhere.
If it had to be the desert, couldn't we have done like
Palm Springs, or something?
God, this guy better have a big dick.
Proof is in the pics.
Hey, let's go!
I can't pee.
-She can't pee! -She can't pee!
So, how do you really feel about him?
Who?
This mystery fiancé!
Yeah, right.
I don't know. When you know, you know.
I'm looking for a man, like manly man.
I just want to smell him all the time.
Ugh. That is gross.
Like, ugh, smell him?
-He smells good! -[chuckles]
Ew.
No, he doesn't like getting his picture taken.
What?
I'm calling it.
This dude's weird.
Not everybody's obsessed with themselves, Carmen.
Not everybody's obsessed with themselves.
I don't know...
Borderline gay?
No socials even?
No, he hates that shit.
He says it conflicts
-The what? -What?
Okay, here they come.
Come on, Liz!
Oh my God.
Ooh.
Sorry, stage fright.
Liz kept staring at me.
I wasn't staring at you.
Okay, Betty, will you please explain
Yeah, it feels different, all right.
to be away from my kids.
They're maniacs.
I mean, I love them,
What's their diet like?
SADIE: Okay.
-Umm, GPS says 28 minutes out. -Okay.
Wooo!
Don't spill that shit in my car, Carmen!
Oh, too late.
Okay, okay.
no-pictures-please, secret marriage.
Okay.
-Oh my God! -Oh my God!
What?
It's great.
It ends bad.
Wow.
What a shithole.
Hope the inside's better than the outside.
We are definitely getting murdered here.
Yay.
Come on, guys.
It's perfect.
Come on!
Hold my hand.
Let's go.
All right, Liz.
Oh my God, June.
What is that smell?
CARMEN: Probably David.
Now I understand the attraction.
So sexy.
It probably just needs to air out.
Maybe they have scented candles somewhere.
Hello there.
What's your name?
Really cute.
It's like a great place to raise a family.
So safe.
It's great.
Just needs a...
A woman's touch.
Yeah, only if the woman is holding a lighter.
I'm kidding.
Look, it's gonna be fun, okay?
and get some dinner.
You're hungry, right?
Promise?
Yes, I promise.
You guys want to check out this hot tub?
See!
Yeah.
Come on, butthead.
Fuck!
What?
I think he's kind of cute.
This isn't funny.
You think this is funny?
LIZ: Oh, fuck.
That's just like--
Oh.
I'm sorry, guys.
Maybe we can drain it or something.
Drain it?
Hey, this isn't your fault.
June?
We--
-JUNE: Whatever! -Close it.
We don't, June.
JUNE: Ah, okay.
Me, me, me, me!
More?
Fill her up.
Fill her up.
Here you go, party pooper.
I'm good.
Okay, there's a goat head in the hot tub.
Fucking drink it.
BETTY: We're all drinking.
-Listen up. -Yes!
Take a drink. Don't set it down.
-Take a drink. -Come on.
Wooo!
Come on.
-Oh... Yes! -Yes!
Wooh!
CARMEN: Yes!
The nerd is fucking drinking!
Now it's a party!
Okay.
Cheers to my little sister.
CARMEN: Oh.
I'm so excited for you.
Cheers to you!
JUNE: Cheers!
Ah! Okay.
Dude, Sadie was married?
I married Satan himself, so that was fun.
Nothing.
I didn't need his money, thank you.
You took it, though.
That's enough, ladies.
It's just sisterly love this weekend
CARMEN: Good times.
Right.
And good vibes.
CARMEN: Yes.
JUNE: Yes!
Okay.
Yes!
And drinks.
Oh, that's not fair.
You're obviously gonna win.
Okay, fuck it.
Let's do it.
So, we're all gonna take turns asking June a question.
If you answer wrong, you take a drink.
Right.
If you don't know the answer, you take two drinks.
Liz, that's two drinks if you get it wrong, okay.
Okay, I'm gonna go first.
Okay, when did June lose her virginity?
-14! -14!
That’s like uh--
Girl!
I have a question.
What is June's favorite movie?
Ooh, Sharknado.
CARMEN: What?
Spice World.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
CARMEN: Really?
Not by choice.
It's only cause this psycho over here made me watch it
You loved it.
That's cute.
We were good.
Sporty Spice sucks.
What?
This is really great, guys.
It's exactly what I wanted.
Five bitches alone in the desert
is exactly what you wanted?
Yeah, it actually is.
Aw.
Hey, you fucking zombie.
Go night-night.
You know what, June?
I have to be honest.
Because I don't really think anyone else
What the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, what are you talking about?
Like, I just don't get this. [chuckles]
Like, any of this.
Like, why aren't you inviting anyone to your wedding?
all the time when we were kids.
This isn't it.
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.
Okay, then why aren't you inviting anyone
who you're marrying in such a fucking hurry?
Okay, wow.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, I don't know.
We don't even hang out anymore.
of whatever the fuck this fucking thing is.
JUNE: Okay, whatever.
You fucking bitch.
Okay, this is fucking crazy.
You're fucking drunk, Liz.
Okay, guys, come on.
Come on.
Seriously.
You are drunk.
Okay, and look,
and not ruin the trip before it's even happened?
Of course, you're trying to ruin this.
Go to bed.
Dang.
You okay?
She just pisses me off.
I shouldn't have invited her.
I'm barely even friends with her anymore.
Stop it.
Yes, you are.
About what?
Um, my wedding.
with your overly supportive, everything is great bullshit.
Don't turn this around on me, okay?
You just said no to everything.
The fucking spa thing.
I mean, fucking look around you.
Look where we are.
I don't want any of that shit, Sadie!
the same fucking mistake that you did.
Not everybody cares about-- about money and fucking status.
and your stupid fucking job,
Well, guess what?
Wow.
Okay, nice to know what you really think about me.
The truth hurts.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?
Nothing!
I am happy!
I'm going to bed.
Fuck you, June.
Are you okay?
No.
No.
Hey.
Get some coffee?
Over there.
You want some?
It's tempting.
I'm sorry, Juney.
I'm sorry, too.
I'm sorry, Sadie.
It's okay.
You know what?
It's a new day, clean slate.
And I'm hiding the tequila from you.
I don't even like it.
Oh, hmm.
Oh, we all love each other again?
Oh.
Oh.
Ooh, somebody needs to brush their teeth.
Liz.
Oh God. Sorry.
All right.
Oh my God.
And she's down.
Breathe in.
Nice corpse pose, Liz.
Hey, Betty.
But thank you so much for that.
It was really great.
Sorry.
This was really fun.
Quitters!
No, wait for me, please.
Do you think there's snakes out here?
How you holding up?
Good.
Bye.
I mean, this is crazy, right?
Yeah.
We gotta get good with it.
Fuck!
No.
I know.
Hey, you remember her 12th birthday party?
No!
Yes, it was.
Now she's marrying some guy with no teeth.
He has some teeth.
Yeah.
That cake was fucking epic.
She had that meltdown.
Oh my God.
Honestly, I just...
I just thought she was smarter than this?
Yeah, me too.
I don't know, maybe we can change her mind?
If not, we can always kill him.
And namaste.
2003, Chateau Lafite Limier.
Cool.
No, not cool.
I don't even want to tell you what it cost.
But you will.
Okay, how much?
2,400.
Oh shit.
Oh my goodness.
Fill her up!
No.
2 ounces to start.
2 ounces?
-Just really let it... -Communion.
Let it breathe, okay.
Let it breathe, let it breathe.
Is that 2 ounces?
Oh, for fuck’s sakes.
And a toast.
June, I think I can speak for everyone here
when I say we're all so happy for you.
You're a gift to my heart.
You're my sister
So, here's to June and David.
Together may they build a life of love,
To June and David.
Hot one never dies first.
Go with her.
Oh my God.
Okay.
Are you expecting someone?
You better be cute.
Hello?
Hello?
Just like lock the fucking door.
Oh, relax.
No, Liz is right.
Lock it.
Jesus, paranoid much?
I don't know, this feels weird.
I don't-- I don't like it.
We're all gonna die.
Baby!
June, what the fuck?
Everybody, this is Davey.
Davey, this is Carmen, Liz, Betty
and you remember my sister Sadie.
Hey, sorry ladies.
Did we scare y'all?
What do you mean we?
Hey everybody, these are my boys Bobby and Mikey.
And that's Puppy.
We brought drinks.
Oh yeah.
Lovely.
I'll take one.
Holy tits.
I'll always drink to us, baby.
Maybe that's not for me.
Puppy, throw me a beer.
Oh, babe! [chuckles]
June.
What?
Bedroom now.
Okay, ow.
Hey ow.
Somebody's in trouble.
I wanted to tell you,
Say no to what?
Come on.
Sadie, that's not cool.
Okay, they're not staying.
David wanted to come by and meet everybody.
Okay.
They said they were close by
Yeah, he was right.
Come on, Sadie.
about is how you know nothing about David.
Well, here is a perfect opportunity
And maybe even like him.
It's fine.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just-- I wish I knew.
Ah.
“Chateau Lafite Limier.
You want some?
No.
Okay.
Bullshit.
I swear to God,
Couldn't do it, man.
Too slow.
Hey, uh, princess Buttercup.
Yeah.
Check this out.
Wow, sexy.
Stupid.
What happened?
Don't ask.
Why?
Well, Betty Boop, if you must know,
Poof. Come on.
Anyways, I was right outside of Elkin
in this shitty little bar, drunk as hell,
and in walks this dude.
Oh, yeah, that's very culturally similar.
MIKE: What?
How was I supposed to know?
Anyways, this dude sits down right next to me
The lighter my grandpops gave me right before he died.
-Fuck y'all. -[Carmen chuckles]
Anyways, this dude takes a shine to my lighter
and asks me how reliable it is.
I tell him it's reliable as fuck.
‘Cause it's fucking American made.
So, he laughs
and takes out this crazy-ass fucking knife
and puts it on the bar.
He tells me it's from the Middle East
or something worth thousands.
if my American lighter can light 10 times
and also gets to keep the lighter.
Let me guess what happened.
Well, you know what fucking happened.
So, instead of just walking away,
saw his ear off clean.
Hey, I may be a jackass, but I'm also a man of my word.
We're here to see you, baby.
Fucking Casanova.
Do not listen to a word he says.
MIKE: Fuck you.
He's more full of shit than a 10-pound robin.
MIKE: Fuck you. Fuck you, man.
Settle the fuck down.
Hey, Junie talks about yous all the time.
that'll take better care of this little girl than me.
Wait a second.
I thought you were missing a tooth?
What?
Sadie said that he was.
Did she say that?
Well, it grew back.
Oh, you smell good.
Like a strawberry.
Thanks, creep.
Am I?
Am I a creep?
DAVID: Be good, Mikey.
Eyes on the prize.
Oh, make no mistake.
I am the prize.
CARMEN: Oh.
The what?
The perimeter.
You see, on this property at night,
Hmm. Imagine that.
Big cats come down from the hills
Bobcats, mountain lions, even.
A real menace.
we figured it’s the least we could do.
Thanks, babe.
Ah, no dear.
Of course, we're gonna kill ‘em.
That's inhumane.
DAVID: What?
You one of them vegans?
Ain't that right, four eyes?
Oh, come on, Liz.
Come on.
Oh, you city folks,
you ain't never gonna understand with all your--
Don't you ever feel bad?
You know, for killing an innocent creature?
Hey!
What?
No.
Sorry.
Do I feel bad?
John 5:24,
“Truly, truly I say to you, whoever hears my words
and believes him who sent me has eternal life.
Can I come with you guys?
It's dark.
Carmen, no.
Your sister thinks she's the boss of everybody.
What's that supposed to mean?
What I said.
No, I'm serious.
It's my bachelorette party, Carmen.
At least, someone around here knows how to have a good time.
Yeah, we'll have her back before sun up.
Yeah, they'll have me back before sun up.
I-- I don't know.
And don't worry,
Yeah, I'll let you hold my gun.
Promise.
No.
No guns, Carmen.
Oh my God, Sadie.
The boss.
Please.
Please, please, please, please, please...
If you really want to.
Okay.
Yes.
Just be safe, okay?
Of course.
I brought magnums.
JUNE: What?
Wow, I really didn't see that one coming.
Oh my God, I can't.
This is so fucking stupid.
Just be careful, okay?
Always.
Carmen doesn't always make the best decisions.
Okay, that is so rude.
Eat my pussy, Liz. Wooh!
That girl is fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Oh my God, that's a dead snake.
Wow.
So cute.
It's like so dusty.
My nose is like super dry.
This is so fun.
Why are we stopping?
We're here.
Oh really?
This is exciting.
Out.
Ooh.
belongs to my family.
It's been passed through the generations
for what feels like an eternity.
It's pretty chill.
We'll go north to see if we can't find a few cats.
And that's when the killing starts?
That's when the killing starts.
What is that for?
No, I'm good.
Oh, perv.
Gentlemen!
Uh, wait, what?
It's a tradition.
Legend goes a month before a wedding,
you bury a bottle of bourbon in the dirt.
Upside down.
Aw.
Yeah.
Well, that's just a modern day belief.
When the bottle is buried underground
and happy life together for eternity.
You're such a softy.
Who knew?
Bury the bourbon!
Bury the bride!
What can I say?
I'm thirsty.
Oh! Oh my God.
That tastes like ass.
But there's nothing shorter of 100% liquid gold.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--
No, no.
No apologies necessary.
It's an acquired taste.
Yeah.
Puppy.
A cool fucking chick.
I know.

Wait.
You want me to call you?
Maybe.
Take that phone out.
Davey!
and my girl.
Come here.
That's right.
Okay, let me see.
Wait.
What?
Cute.
Worried about her?
I just, I couldn't sleep.
Yeah, me neither.
Now, that's okay.
Hey.
Hey you.
Did you guys have fun?
Where's Carmen?
I don't know.
Okay, I-- I don't understand.
What's going on?
She's a big girl.
Okay.
Watch your tone.
JUNE: David.
Jesus Christ, could you guys be any louder?
They came back without Carmen.
Oh my God.
Okay, what?
You-- you just left her out there?
It's okay, guys, they're just fucking with us.
Is that fucking blood?
We got a cat.
Yeah, a big yella motherfucker.
LIZ: Okay.
Somebody better start fucking talking
or there's gonna be a serious fucking problem.
You think this is fucking funny?
Everybody just calm the fuck down.
Booty shorts got a little too drunk for the drive back,
so we left her there to cuddle up with Pup.
Okay, take me to her.
Now!
June, your friend needs to watch herself.
Yeah, well, this isn't cool, David.
Fine.
Now!
DAVID: I'll take you.
No, I think we should stay.
She's-- she's fine.
She's fine.
Of course, she's fine.
with little Lizzie Borden here.
And you know, we'll have some pancakes.
Yeah, sorry to scare you ladies.
She likes to party.
Yeah, that's for damn sure.
Jesus.
I'll be right back.
in the fucking dark with Puppy?
Puppy!
This is your friend.
Okay, Liz doesn't even fucking like Carmen
and she's more concerned than you.
Okay, Sadie.
and my shortcomings as a fucking human being.
June.
Come on.
What, you think this is fucking funny?
You stupid fucking redneck.
Oh, my fucking God.
Oh, and just for the record,
I am officially voting no on this marriage to June.
Fuck.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, my God!
What?
What's wrong?
Sadie, what the fuck happened?
He fucking killed...
He fucking killed her.
Who killed?
David.
David fucking just killed Liz in the truck.
Everything's okay.
He-- he killed her.
JUNE: Sadie, stop it!
June, I'm not fucking kidding, okay?
There was blood everywhere.
JUNE: Hey, Sadie, stop it!
Stop!
June, I'm fucking serious, okay?
There was blood everywhere.
Listen, this is fucking insane!
Okay, I know you don't like him,
You serious?
Come here.
It's okay.
I'm serious, okay?
I fucking...
I fucking...
With my own eyes.
And--
And Liz was yelling at him.
And she's dead.
I'm fucking sure!
Oh God.
Okay.
Oh God, I need to think.
Let me think for a second.
We need to go, like right now, okay?
BETTY: Okay, June.
-Where's June? -June!
She's out there with them.
Betty, she's out there with them.
-Betty, I-- -Oh my God.
June, June!
DAVID: We're in here, ladies!
Where's Liz?
Hey, she's not feeling well.
You killed her!
Jesus.
Why is everybody so uptight around here?
No, David!
David!
What are you doing?
Lock your door.
Pups, nice of you to join us.
I assume you're finished with the play thing?
Don't you fucking touch me!
Fuck you!
June, sit down!
Sit down.
You know, having to admit your friends were right about me.
I'm not a nice guy.
I'm not exactly what I said I was.
Well, tell her the other thing.
Please don't kill us. [cries]
Boops!
You're ruining the surprise!
Okay, I'll tell you.
Sorry.
No please, David.
Please just let her go.
You have two choices, alright?
And honestly, I'm gonna leave it for you all to decide,
One.
I could blow her fucking head off.
No, David she has kids!
Please.
Don't interrupt me, June.
BETTY: My babies. [crying]
Or two.
I could rip her open
and fucking eat her for breakfast.
See, I told you it's a big decision.
See, he told you.
Here's the kicker.
You know, by now you're probably realizing
would exactly refer to as normal.
You know, old Betty here's gonna die either way.
to party in the after party.
Please, David...
Again with the fucking interruptions!
What's with that?
They never stop.
Never stop.
Okay, what the fuck are you talking about?
You see, this land here,
this is some un-fucking holy land.
If you bury her, she will come back.
And she will be one of us.
I'd rather fucking die!
Tell 'em the best part.
Oh, yeah, this is good.
See, y'all are probably wondering,
especially you, Junie, why the engagement party?
Why the wedding plans?
You see, the boys and me,
we started a tradition, many years ago.
but hey, it is what it is.
Usually desperate.
Eager to get out of her boring life.
You know the type, right, June?
to come out here for a little bachelorette party.
Last year was Mikey's turn.
That was a fucking wild one, wasn't it, Mikey?
Sure was.
Goddamn.
We hunt them down one by one.
Eat 'em, drink their blood.
And the ones we really like we bring back for a little play.
June, the gun!
Get the gun!
Come on, baby.
You don't want to do that.
Yes, I do.
You fucking freak!
Yeah, move and your fucking next.
Puppy, buddy old pal, care to step in on any of this?
You ain't gonna shoot me.
Wow.
Let's assess the current situation.
We have two guns.
Mine, which I know is fully loaded
I'm gonna guess not, but I could be wrong.
but I am certain that a very upset Bobby
or a very unstable Puppy will rip your sister apart
but the end result is always the same.
Y'all die.
DAVID: Then try me.
Shoot.
Listen, I have an idea.
and get you three out of the shed?
I can't promise I ain't gonna kill you later,
but hey, what can I say, feeling patient.
SADIE: June.
June.
June.
June!
A couple hours, I think.
I fell asleep, too.
So, what?
Are they vampires or something?
Seems like it.
I don't know.
We're all getting out of here, okay?
No.
David was right.
They would have killed you both. And then me.
But I deserve it.
Like, I can't believe Liz and Carmen are gone.
Hey, focus, okay?
Apparently, a shotgun to the head.
You have a fucking gun, Betty?
Well, aren't-- aren't crosses a thing?
Or a stake to the heart, right?
Daylight.
Oh, ho-- holy water.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
Oh!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Okay, okay. It’s okay, it’s okay.
Okay, step one, We get out of the fucking murder shed.
Okay.
Oh. Okay. Okay.
Yes, yes.
Yes, June, yes!
It’s working, it’s working.
Oh, no!
Oh, fuck no!
Okay.
Where are they?
Fucking if I know.
Let's get in the car and go.
The car keys, I--
I'll go.
No.
We're all gonna go, okay?
Okay.
They're not here.
Okay. Maybe they're in the car.
Let's just go check there.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Oh, hey, little bucks.
Fuck, I really hate that guy.
No offense.
I found your keys.
Leave us the fuck alone!
Let us go.
Oh, you can go.
You know, in fact I think,
your head start should start right now.
5, 4, 3...
Go!
2, 1.
“Though I than He, may longer live,
I thought she was right behind us.
No, no, no, no.
Sadie, there's a house right there.
Come on.
DAVID: Betty!
Oh God.
DAVID: Betty!
Betty!
Carmen? Carmen?
Carmen?
Carmen? Carmen?
Carmen?
Oh, no.
Help.
Oh my God.
I found a flashlight.
Fuck.
Sorry.
June, what the fuck is it?
Oh no.
Oh my God.
Stop!
I know it looks bad.
But I can explain, please.
Don't fucking move!
PUPPY: I know.
I'm not like them.
I won't hurt you, I promise.
I can help you.
Stop!
Fucking stop!
I was just like you.
My little sister.
She was about your age.
She was beautiful.
SADIE: Stop!
They kept me...
...kept me around as a joke.
Stop moving!
Something to play with, to torture.
You see the way they treat me?
Like...
Like a prisoner, an animal.
They're sick.
My name's not Puppy!
It's Andrew.
Andrew Tosh.
I used to sell insurance.
I'm a man, not a dog.
They'd kill me if I didn't.
If you didn't...
If you didn't hit me like that, then I would've let you go.
I swear.
Stop moving!
Please.
Please.
They're always after me.
Don't kill me.
Please.
Please.
Bullshit.
He wasn't.
Oh shit!
Keep going, keep going.
Oh my God!
Oh fuck, no!
-June, please, just get in. -I can't.
June, please.
What about the gun?
Can it get it wet?
How the fuck should I know?
The first time I used it was
to blow a fucking vampire's head off.
Okay, okay.
I'll hide it.
I'll hide it.
Okay.
DAVID: June!
Oh my God, now.
Oh.
Oh my God!
Oh fuck.
Relax, relax. It's fucking dead, June.
No fucking shit.
It's staring at me.
I don't know.
DAVID: Fuck!
Oh, yeah, but--
DAVID: June!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
I think so.
June, we gotta go before they come back, okay?
Okay.
-Okay. -Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye, buddy.
Grab the gun.
Oh, right.
June, they fucking took it.
Wait, I don't get it.
They grabbed the gun,
Or they're really fucking stupid.
Let's just hope they're stupid.
We gotta go.
We gotta go, okay?
That.
Fuck, it's locked.
Okay, find a key.
Fuck this shit!
Nice, June, nice.
Oh yeah.
This is mine.
SADIE: Oh, shit!
Yeah.
I think it's a bear trap.
Fuck!
Help me open it, okay?
Okay. Okay.
Take it.
Fuck.
How do we pry it?
Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Um, okay, I have to secure this, right?
Okay.
I saw a hammer in the shed.
I'll go get it.
Okay, be careful.
Okay.
JUNE: Sadie?
Sadie!
JUNE: Sadie!
Let her go.
She's mine.
Take me, then!
No offense, but you ain't my type.
I love you, baby.
I'ma kill you.
I'm gonna enjoy that.
Although, I think he may wanna kill you
I wonder what he's gonna do to you when I let him out.
You ain't gonna do shit.
Please, David, please.
Except watch your sister die!
No!
No!
I know you think this is your fault.
I used to be fun before mom left him
and dad became a fucking shell of himself.
I just...
I missed out on
doing stupid shit with my friends.
And with you.
I became so fucking serious,
that I couldn't even stand myself.
You were always so kind, and happy, and carefree.
The only thing,
I've ever done right in my whole life
And I failed.
I let it happen.
This is my fault!
This is my fault.
It's all gonna be okay now, June.
The sun.
It does work.
Just not right away.
Good.
Die slowly.

Report to the Captain.
Good evening, welcome.
Quiet heart, healthy mind...
We're giving free meals to the elderly.
I'll let you go when I find a way.
I won't lose...
Your zodiac's on the Grand Throne in 2 years.
Just imagine it.
Say it.
SLOW
Still nameless at this early hour
Vast spaces under the blue skies
Look as beautiful as you
Listen, my dear
I've planted a seed
Listen, my dear
I've come to know
<i>Your name blossoms and warms me like a flame</i>
I'm the interpreter, about the lesson.
Oh, hi!
Oh. Right.
Sorry. Didn't know.
Tell them they can put their stuff here.
Did I?
Need help with anything?
Not really.
I've been thinking.
Let's just go somewhere.
Like, now?
- Into what? - Well...
You mean, dancing?
You know what they say.
Who says that?
Math is easy.
Good.
Why so chirpy?
Nothing, just a good mood.
It is funny.
I mean, I just had this...
Nothing cute about it.
That's for 'pops'.
Sure, did you see him look at her?
You're so observant.
Don't know, it felt kinda stupid afterwards.
Well, I like it.
What?
Whatever that means.
I'm not sure it's relevant but... the day before yesterday.
Serious?
Fuck...
What did you learn there?
I'm not very cultivated.
So when's the big day?
Some time in July...
I'm interpreting those classes.
You thought it was mine?
That's how it sounded.
I'm headed across the square.
And I'm going up.
You know what?
I made a ridiculous amount of soup yesterday.
My brother's deaf.
I'm not very quick.
"Break through"?
So I just started learning it with him.
Ended up an interpreter.
So essentially, you were just lazy to study something else.
I'm just a big lazy bum.
You live here by yourself?
So what does one wall say to the other wall?
Careful now.
What? I'm doing great.
You know what's weird?
Is it good or bad?
It's good.
It's not clear, though.
Absolutely nothing.
There was no transition.
So what does it mean?
Don't know.
Maybe you just don't like me?
I do like you.
It's why I wanted to tell you.
Do I look good?
About what I've told you...
You know?
A relationship, for example.
That came out stupid.
But it didn't sound stupid.
It's not like I'm physically incapable of something.
Not gross. I just don't.
I simply don't need it.
I googled it.
I bet.
OK. Thanks guys.
Elena, you're OK?
But don't worry about me, OK?
<i>Just find a place for yourself and try to stay in the moment.</i>
"We'll go to McDonald's," to calm me down.
"If you cry, you'll disgrace yourself."
Sure, to meet her.
How old are you there?
"I want to learn ballet."
"Why don't you choose something else, dear."
That's what I said.
And what did you do?
Took up basketball.
Was pretty good, too.
And she said,
You were in Luxembourg at the time.
like you said.
Would you like more tea?
No, we'll be going now.
We're going to McDonald's.
Do you like me?
Of course I do.
I'm not going to change.
Fine, me neither.
Let's dance.
You... want to go somewhere?
That's so cool!
Well, I like it.
What's this?
Yeah, with black hair, black clothes, all that stuff.
My goth side?
Yeah, it totally fits you.
Let's go, they're waiting for drinks.
Yeah. I like it.
It was just for fun, we were partying.
used to being free.
How do you want it?
"Normal"?
Just us and no one else.
With
You
To mine
In a trembling voice
I asked it
What it thinks about it
It yearns to tear itself in two
Never mind the pain
I've seen it all in your eyes
Is it OK?
Isn't it gross?
Just stop it.
Relax.
It's OK, Dovydas.
Oh dear...
I think it's funny.
Well, let's count how long the landline phone hasn't rung.
Still not funny.
I find it hilarious.
I've had this hairband for three months.
No idea.
Maybe the same place socks go?
You're right!
Oh well, then.
It is funny.
You just needed time
to get it.
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four...
Let's take it from here.
five, six, seven, eight...
Wait, what's the actual tempo?
Shall I go?
picking up on people, asking what love is.
Do you realise I love you?
Go home, OK?
Have some water.
What if we break up
Will you make a bed for me?
I mean it.
Dovydas, stop it!
Hey, nothing happened then.
We just smoked a joint and I left.
After I told you, was it?
Yes, after. But not because of it.
I don't know, we weren't together. I did nothing wrong.
I didn't reject you.
Were you trying to prove something?
No, it's fine.
Thanks.
For god's sake...
Are you going for a beer? Get one for me.
Why? What does he want?
He texts "what's up?" at 1AM. What do you think he wants?
Wait, so if you write "what's up?", it means you want sex?
Not necessarily. It depends on
who you write to and when.
Do you miss it?
What?
That lifestyle.
You mean, promiscuous?
Come on, I'm really curious.
Well, maybe...
That look when
you know someone's truly into you.
And the energy...
It can be so powerful.
I can't apologize every time.
I know.
I'm OK.
Doesn't it hurt?
You can go harder.
How can you always be so sure about everything?
I remember when you told me.
We were by the river, drinking wine.
Even when you were with Donatas?
My god, Viktorija!
Seriously, though.
Don't you miss guys?
The attention..?
Love..?
My mother kept asking this for a long time.
Isn't it hard to have no family,
no children, no flat...
You know what's the worst part?
I actually
hardly ever think about it.
I never feel lonely.
I just want to know.
I'm just saying.
You're drunk.
Neither do I.
Open relationship...
Damn it, who set the rules for everyone to live by?
Dovydas...
You know, I...
Like what?
But this life doesn't suit everybody.
Of course not.
if you slept with other guys,
would that make me less of a man?
Who invented this whole system?!
You feel sick?
Can you unhook it?
To keep your head from spinning.
Do you ever feel like...
Like what?
Like,
there's something wrong with you.
Were you jerking off?
Well, yeah.
Seriously?
I don't see it as a particularly
sexual act.
But that involves thinking about someone.
You're not thinking at all?
What are you, a Buddhist?
- Not necessarily. - Yes, necessarily.
No, it's about physiology, that's all.
What's the difference?
You could fucking try at least.
OK, I'm sorry I'm not normal enough for you.
I didn't say you weren't normal enough.
Fine, go live your life.
Like I'm always disappointing you?
Me, to leave you?
I love you too.
How's Dovydas?
What are you doing here?
Bought it off you.
- I never had one. - Not too late to get it.
Your place, then?
Oh fuck off.
I met with Vilius.
What are you doing?
Wake you up?
Look, I just met him. Nothing happened.
I thought we were beyond that stuff.
What are you doing?
Going for a walk.
Stop!
Let's just go home.
No more arguing, OK?
Got your swim trunks?
You're fucking kidding.
We'll break up and it'll be like nothing ever happened.
There will be nothing.
I'm tired.
Yeah.
Fuck, fuck...
When you were yelling at me.
I wasn't.
I didn't even know
I really...
I yearn to tear myself in two
<i>After all there's nothing lovelier in the world</i>
What once was
And what will be
What once was
And what will be
<i>Today 2012, 21st December.</i>
<i>But nothing happened anywhere...</i>
<i>December 21, 2012, remember this date?</i>
<i>The date about which people around the world are buzzing,</i>
<i>'Doomsday' is not a Hollywood movie,</i>
<i>Is everyone going to die that day?</i>
<i>What does science say?</i>
I don't understand anything.
Hello! Welcome back.
The date about which people around the world are buzzing,
'Doomsday' is not a Hollywood movie,
Is everyone going to die that day?
What does science say?
- Listen Brahmam! - Sir!
How would I know about doomsday?
Brahmam! Sir?
Leave that glass aside for some time and listen to me.
But if he confesses the truth on camera,
the people would immediately switch the channel.
You can sleep later.
It's very easy!
And immediately the people would ditch the TV and surround you.
the media will at least gain TRPs, what would I gain?
Idiot!
but we can exploit their fears.
Shut up, you dumbass!
This is why you are still begging others for favours.
Listen!
If it does happen,
I understood Mr. Bhushanam!
Come forward!
Daniel, you too have a role.
But you have the worst image overall.
Pour drinks for me now.
<i>What is the catastrophe that humankind is about to face?</i>
When shall we start?
I have done my part.
Continue that!
<i>Potuluri Veerabrahmam come true before the Doomsday?</i>
"Oh my god!"
"What is this magic?"
"Oh no! What is this?
"Oh no! Oh God!"
"What is this magic?"
"Oh no! Oh Jesus!"
while proposing someone?
<i>This time when you come home,</i>
Really?
<i>Yes, she told me herself.</i>
Ok, I'll come.
Shiva!
Shiva!
Is the file rendered?
Sir, please come.
Superb!
It matches Hollywood standards.
Graphics should not be evidently seen, should they?
Avatar.
I have not spent my money to recreate a live tiger,
You better understand.
You should be updated.
Sir, please do as he says.
Shiva, remove the top 2 or 3 layers
What are you talking about?
Are we artists or prostitutes?
Muthyam, I got the bird.
Go, get it.
Bloody imbecile!
he would blame me for not searching for it well.
Muthyam, what have you done about our plan?
Don't forget that.
Set that imbecile right and I would grant you half an acre of land.
Gummatala Veera Narasimha Muthyam, son of Gummatala Veera Shankara Muthyam.
Bloody!
Shall I roast it and take it home? Madam might relish it!
Leave it, madam might not enjoy it.
Mr. President, I have to tell you something,
don't get your daughter married to an NRI.
You are right.
Even their horoscope matched.
You are right.
This is nothing, my great-grandfather,
Why should we believe you either?
Will our village drown too, grandpa?
Are we staying on the moon to be insulated from the event?
There are no Ghosts.
<i>The one who dispels fear.</i>
Hey, brother is here...
That's a five-star.
Say what you want to but I wouldn't trust the media people ever.
Don't you remember the chaos created by the news of Skylab's fall on the radio?
Had the media been present in those times,
Mr. President!
Check out his attitude!
Bloody!
Hey, Shiva!
Did you buy me the cigarette?
Did you at least light my cigarette?
Did my smoke affect you?
He feeds his buffalo an ounce and extracts 10 ounces of milk.
He is a roadside Romeo who has no other worthwhile contribution to this village.
Did Shiva resign from his job?
It seems Shiva harass someone at office.
Is it?
I'm coming...
Your son created a nuisance in his office.
what a ruckus he created!
Shiva is coming home. Have you prepared lunch?
If not, get upma ready.
Wait, I'll check if we have cashews.
Why are you scolding me?
Damn it!
Uncle, you look so active?
How pretty! She looks like a movie heroine.
Pour this petrol into the vehicle.
She can't digest my happiness.
<i>Mr. Raja Gajaveera Bahubalabahudur...</i>
Sit down, guys.
There it is, flying in the sky...
It is going, going, going...
God knows what your great-grandfather used to eat,
- nobody has his strength in today's times. - You are right.
He would chew up the bones too.
A grown-up elephant failed to push him aside once.
<i>It is going, going, going...</i>
Make an attempt. You have big muscles. Why don't you try once?
Why? What would do with that hollow cup of his?
Sir, Shiva says he would break the record if he gets Rs.10,000 as a prize.
"Shiva has come!"
"Shiva has come!"
<i>but Shiva has landed the spear in the river.</i>
Mr. President, money?
"You won't leave anyone in the world, it's very strange"
"Tell us, who are you, Shiva?"
"Tell us, who are you, Shiva?"
"Tell us, who are you, Shiva?"
"Tell us, who are you, Shiva?"
"What's the talk now, Shiva?"
My father will kill me if he sees this.
Since then, he has been acting like a statue.
"He doesn't leave his pleasure"
Brother-in-law, do you see his antics?
He could throw my great-grandfather's spear that long,
Muthyam, did you find that spear?
Yes. That's my great-grandfather's spear.
I will get a Hero cycle...
Shiva! How fortunate you are!
I've been observing you since my childhood,
you are living your life on your terms.
Like a rat inside a hole, I have to do everything inside these four walls.
Darn...
the President's daughter was looking at you like this... with lust-filled eyes.
Can't I dance like you?
Play a nice song.
Play it! Play it!
Play it! Play it!
I am dancing now.
It's very soft.
Have this buttermilk.
Your grandfather.
An idiot!
I'm his son,
I'm a fool too.
You are not born a Mahatma!
But the whole village need not know about your uselessness.
I won't stop you.
But drink only at home.
We are just doing a show-off!
Look here! Look!
Listen, be careful until you get married to the President's daughter.
I won't repeat it.
Remember this, my dear son!
One minute...
What happened to you?
I am feeling scared.
Don't do such stupid things. He will beat me into a pulp.
One minute, brother.
Hello, what is it?
Please. Please do this. Go.
Tell me.
If you can propose to her one more time, she will raise her hand in affirmation.
She will raise her hand if I propose here, is it?
Am I a school teacher?
He is acting to extort money from you. Bloody scoundrel!
Wait, Mary. Tell me, Daniel.
Why are you doing this?
Father, I saw Jesus in my dreams.
Bloody drunkard,
Atheist fellow! Scoundrel, rogue, rascal, scumbag...
- Kick the stool. - Please...
"Hallelujah... Hallelujah!"
"Hallelujah..."
You are a great trickster, Daniel.
Just nod your head
He should start the proceedings for people to believe it.
Be brave!
Baghvad Geeta and Bible are not only for worshipping...
To be used as well!
Coming to cheating...
Suppose you are hungry,
If you sit on the banks of a river and call the fish to satiate your hunger,
What will we do?
We take a stick, wrap a thread, tie a fishing hook,
<i>Good plan. But be careful,</i>
I like it.
Do you believe in God?
The entire Geetha...
what is happening in the present is for good too
Why do you worry, girl?
I too am telling this one last time, this gives me a kick,
Hold on to your useless kick...
"She becomes fire in moments"
"Greet me in the moonlight like the moon itself"
"Come lets listen to the thrilling stories"
"Won't you miss the track of your path?"
"Even my shadow goes in shock touching you"
"She becomes fire in moments"
"The dreams calls me towards it"
"What will you do if someone sees us in such time?"
"The world doesn't have any other job"
"Our job is ours"
"They are from my heart"
"Come to me"
"This isn't the time"
"Does sleep kick in today?"
That's no big deal.
The media has frightened us already,
Alright, you don't believe in God.
Do one thing, wear a locket that covers your ♪♪♪ too.
'He got trapped now.'
If you would accompany me, just this one time,
He is creating panic in the village with his dreams.
Move aside... Move!
Move!
He is meditating, sir.
Meditating, my foot. Why is he meditating? Ask him to come out.
Bhushan, you must not disturb the ones who are in meditation.
Brother-in-law...
Move away. If he is late,
Sir?
Brahmam, what are you doing?
Throw that book away and take Bhagavad Geetha in your hand.
Keep the shlokas aside and just tell me the meaning of it. I'm already tensed.
Oh Arjuna, it does not befit you to yield to this unmanliness.
Mr. Brahmam,
your get-up, and the background with smoke set-up,
By the way, you are frightening people about doomsday more than the TV reporters.
but in the morning I was still sleeping beside my wife.
- Hail Lord Shiva! - Wow! What else?
Petty human!
Come here.
Coming.
I am Bhushan, Bedurlanka's Chiranjeevi!
Do you see the skies spitting out the fire?
Yes, I can.
I can see it.
With strange happenings you can't even dreama about...
Is the nature weeping?
Can you see it?
Yeah! Yeah!
- Yes. I see the President dying. - No just that...
This is the Almighty's decision.
Hail Lord Shiva.
Get lost!
Oh great soul, leave the common folks. Show the future to the President,
Mr. President...
Please tell us how to save ourselves.
Go.
I'm still thinking about it.
Hail Lord Shiva.
Oh, Gurudev!
Save us, Guru!
<i>Will the cataclysmic event break the Earth into pieces?</i>
<i>Will it happen in one day</i>
Don't go away, be with us.
Damn! Idiot!
and has sent me to serve you.
You all know that I have cheated my parents and many others in this village.
But today, I'm baptized.
Bloody scoundrel.
Then tell me what is written in Psalm 30:3 of the old testament.
No... don't open the bible
Now, what has this sinner questioned me,
Whom did he ask?
Who asked me?
I, a sinner, have asked the recently baptized you
Answer it quickly.
Yes, I'm going to answer it.
It is missing, Daddy.
I have searched the whole Bible.
"Hallelujah... Hallelujah!"
"Hallelujah... Hallelujah!"
Listen, everybody.
Today, a sinner has questioned me,
Husha! Busha! All fall down! Hallelujah!
You may check it.
He is our saviour!
He is our saviour!
He is our saviour from doomsday!
Oh, Lord... Such sinners are erasing your credibility,
please open their eyes and show them the right path.
Master, forgive me.
Brahmam, this is why when Arjuna was in confusion, Lord Sri Krishna told...
Master! I beg you, don't start with your Bhagavad Geetha sermons.
You dumbo!
If you try to disobey me,
With your lie exposed, the public would chase you like mad dogs.
Dumb idiot!
"Praise our saviour, Brahmam!"
Great soul! Great soul!
Yes, there's a way.
What is the solution?
Village loot.
We shall anoint it with Panchamrit...
and then offer it to mother Ganga.
Bring it down!
What a sacred opportunity!
You, petty human!
You bugger!
In a huge war with an elephant...
Beware!
and his family will grant all their gold.
Later, he will offer me all the Gold made for the Goddess.
Only after that...
He is giving an Oscar-winning performance.
Who would go against Mr. President's orders?
Gold is a minuscule thing.
What do you say, guys?
Let me utilise this opportunity to my benefit before Kantam finds this out.
- gold and make a humongous cross... - Ok, father.
"Everywhere in the world, everyone's the same..."
Sir, I have saved this gold for my daughter's marriage.
The world is about to end...
Let the gold go but, I can't tolerate hunger anymore.
My stomach is bloating because it's empty.
Bible, and Quran to make them understand.
There is a right time for everything.
Half the villagers must have pawned their gold here.
She is getting angry too...
Stupid! This is my favourite necklace.
"You have no competition. You are incomparable."
"You have no competition. You are incomparable."
"People should be astounded by your feat."
What happened? Why did you call me?
Nothing. I wanted to have a cigarette.
Stop it. Don't act over-smart.
My dad will make new ones for me.
Why? Everyone is donating. Are you not?
Not at all. Don't do such stupid things.
My dad already hates you.
he would hate you even more.
Hey, are you eating everything?
Mom, coffee?
I'm going.
Shiva!
Exactly! I dreamt of you and Chitra getting married.
I even dreamt of your kids.
Keep the coffee on the table.
Mom!
- Hallelujah! - "Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"
Shiva!
Hallelujah!
Move!
Hey, Shiva!
If needed, I will sell it and buy alcohol with that money.
Even if the Prime Minister tells me too...
Mr. Bhushan, I have a doubt...
Lord Sree Vishnu appears in every yug in a different avatar.
In that case, if Lord Sree Vishnu himself couldn't stop
the destruction of the previous three yugs with all his avatars,
how did you believe them, sir?
Who was the other?
- Huh? - Just asking!
Just asking.
- What is this? - We gave everything. What now?
What would happen now?
Shambho Shankara!!
Devotee!
A deed done here will resonate with the whole world.
The whole world will survive the cataclysm.
If needed, I would sacrifice my life.
And I will fight the cataclysm.
I shall save our village.
This is my oath!
Sons of the Lord! Ignore that atheist!
I would sacrifice my life to save you.
Hallelujah!
He said, not only the President, but he wouldn't listen to the Prime Minister.
I will outcast him from this village.
But you...
You want to oppose the villagers and lose the girl you love, do you?
Yes, son. Think about it again.
I won't do what I don't believe.
That's my self-respect. That's not ego.
but I love you more than you can ever imagine since my childhood.
Now they are merged, Shiva.
They bashed people who told the truth.
Take it easy.
Shiva, no matter how much you think, you have just two options.
Either live in accordance with society,
Shiva would never give his rings away.
Mr. Daniel, forgive me.
Forgive me, Mr. Brahmam.
Forgive me.
Mr. President, forgive me.
It was my fault that I questioned your beliefs. Forgive me for that.
But this is my belief.
When the whole village is donating their gold, what's your problem?
I don't see the devotion in this act, I see only fear.
What are you talking about?
He has built so many temples and religious places.
Even in this, I see only self-boasting but not devotion.
What are you talking?
Since the matter has come this far, let's settle it here.
How dare you! How can you wrong the President's family?
Come back.
Siri! Siri!
Call her.
She is already on the call.
Nobody from this village will ever talk with your family.
Think about it once again.
If needed, I would fall on his feet to forgive us.
But please think again.
Give that...
Throw the fake ones in the river and we shall pocket these real gold.
Citing various reasons...
I'm planning a trip to Bangkok!
What will you do in Bangkok?
From there I'll directly come to Bangkok.
What does it mean?
Look, the thing is...
I too shall follow him to Bangkok...
What will you do there?
Brahmam!
Shambho Shankara!
Shambho Shankara! Shambho Shankara!
Hallelujah!
Shambho Shankara!
Hallelujah!
Shambho Shankara!
Shambho Shankara!
Devotees!
Children of God, you may now stop your fasting.
Our prayer has been sent to the Almighty.
You may go and eat.
You may... Wait... Wait...
Brother-in-law...
Such a feat was once achieved by Saint Bhageeratha.
After him, it's only you.
Brahmam, shall I tell you something?
The one who is in hunger begs for food,
and the one with a satiated stomach begs for validation.
Mr. Brahmam just told me a good news.
My son respects you a lot.
Although you have stopped the cataclysmic event,
the villagers are still fearing any untoward event.
Yes.
Come, come.
Okay.
He might enter the village and cause a ruckus.
Ask our men to seal the village borders.
Okay, sir.
Prabhavati! Prabhavati...
I have fixed Chitra's marriage with Kasiraju.
Start the preparations.
Mom...
I don't want to marry him.
Our choices and desires don't matter to them.
But, after I grew up...
People talk about the dress I wear
but no one cares about my inner feelings.
Chitra, I don't believe in God.
But I visit the temple so that I can enjoy momentary freedom at least.
Do you know the greatest gift man possesses?
Forgetting!
We, women, possess that a little more than men.
Mom!
Her dad forced me into this alliance.
But you know, right?
Your talk seems weird.
Come to my farmhouse in the evening.
I doubt your intentions.
Don't you trust me?
I swear on my Goddess.
Hi, bro.
Hello, bro.
Hello, bro. Is this yours?
It's okay. I don't mind having other people's food.
Bro, you are getting a call.
Hello, bro... pick up the call, it might solve your problem.
Let me pick it up.
I thought you committed suicide already.
I'm going to marry your lover and take her to bed.
I'll look straight into her eyes and...
Bro! This guy is riding the bike at jet speed.
Save me!
I beg you, please stop the bike. Stop it. He stopped.
Wait, wait. Don't go.
Hey, rascals.
Why are you taking so much trouble for that damn cycle?
Aren't you doing the job of security for a damn bottle? Do your job.
Rascals! Go to hell.
I'm having the same doubt.
We shall own Benz like the celebrities.
Why are you doing all this?
What will do with that spear? Come.
So I order the villagers to hold him captive and offer him to us.
Your Daniel.
Shiva!
Shiva, leave me.
Don't hit me. Shiva!
Leave me. Shiva! Kill him!
Uncle, I thrashed that Shiva and brought her here.
Come...
Please go away...
Come, they should be somwehere around.
- Hey! Search inside! - Oh no!
Come, let's go. He is running away.
Let's go guys. We'll get him some other time.
How will the cataclysm take place?
Shiva, what shall we do now?
Will it happen in seconds? Or will it take hours?
The reason could be anything but the common factor is
When in need, both ideas and opportunities would find their way to you.
The entire universe would conspire to help you.
It would happen elsewhere but it would happen here.
What is this?
I accidentally stepped on a landmine that I planted. It happens when I'm tipsy.
Thank God, you didn't die!
Not did Balayya distrust Boyapati.
You must trust me. Otherwise, I'm leaving.
Will you not stop me?
Its alright.
In first grade, I loved to eat chalk pencils.
You brought me three nuts in the third grade.
And in fourth grade...
Sure. One second.
What are you looking at? Get the load.
I remember how you beat me in the tenth grade because I disobeyed you.
Who are you?
Why did you get me here?
You are the hero. Everything is set. Ready?
There is a comedian role in Rajamouli's next movie. I'll get you that role.
A comedian's role in Rajamouli's movie?
No. Let that be.
Done.
Double done then!
Ready?
Wait and watch me!
<i>The day when the world is gasping its last breath.</i>
<i>Is the world ending today?</i>
<i>Is the world perishing today?</i>
<i>To know the details Stay tuned to, TV 777.</i>
Dear!
Praise the lord! This was not my prediction,
I just repeated what Jesus told me in my dreams.
Hallelujah!
Witness the marriage.
What a misfortune!
For the first time, we are attending a marriage without any jewellery on us.
Yes, it has stopped.
Start playing the instruments!
Nothing happened... Please continue...
The Shiva Shankara Varaprasad show begins!
Here we go.
How would I know?
Hello!
Kishore, show us your talent.
<i>God doesn't show mercy on us.</i>
<i>As predicted by the Mayan calendar...</i>
<i>The catastrophe has commenced.</i>
You showed me the dreams of Bangkok and shit! You idiot.
- Wait till everything is... - Shut up, idiot!
Hey, Daniel! Ew! What the hell, Daniel!
Shiva!
Chitra!
You look very pretty in this attire, Chitra.
I want to smoke.
Feelings are very volatile, Chitra.
But beauty has at least 5-6 years of guarantee.
Do you want proof?
- ONG - What?
Go ahead with one.
One...
Two...
Three...
I'm going to tell you the secret behind this master plan. Listen carefully, dear.
That's it!
Shiva! Did you do all this for me?
Breaking news! The continent Antarctica is no more.
A tsunami has consumed the whole continent.
Oh Shit!
The cataclysmic event just crossed America and has reached Europe.
Visuals, please!
Bro, the megacities are being washed away into oceans.
Oh, shit! I'm coming.
Hey!
If anyone steps ahead, I'll shoot down their heads. Wait there!
Wait there!
Mr. President, do something!
Who will save us?
Hello, Mr. Bhushanam!
The whole world is going down.
Get down. Get down my boat.
Sir, Sir! Please don't leave me here.
Mr. Bhushanam! Please help me, God will grant you heaven.
If you want, I'll give away my rings.
Our village is much better.
Brother-in-law, I used swear words for you. please forgive me.
Everything is finished.
Estan Listos Mu cha chos Are you ready, guys?
"Your heart is wavering with freight..."
"Death is looking straight into your eyes" Look at those flowers.
"Your heart is wavering with freight..."
"Death is looking straight into your eyes" Check the radio.
Shiva, we also have a radio in our house.
Wait!
Take this.
Whoa! I'm a one-time learner!
Is it?
<i>The neem tree giving milk in Khammam.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Visuals please, if possible...</i>
You, wretched!
You, wretched!
You caused your parents to shed tears publicly.
You disowned the girl who loved you.
You chose those materialistic rings over your own people...
Now that death is impending, you beg for refuge in the same village, do you?
Wretched person!
Everybody forgive me.
Catastrophe! I have corrected my sins.
- ONG! - Hey tell me...
Speak properly.
Tell me, madam.
One more.
- Full or half or qurter? - Full.
The catastrophe didn't stop despite my atonement!
Who would save us?
Just one person!
Who is he?
Mr. Brahmam!
I will create the Atma Linga with shining, lightning...
Mr. Brahmam?
Where is Mr. Brahmam?
Just once, Kantham. I locked up my libido all my life. I can't anymore.
I want to enjoy that pleasure just once before I die.
Just agree this one time.
It's wrong, Mr. Brahmam...

Please! Please, Kantham. Just do it once with me.
but you refuse me, though I'm pleading in front you.
You will rot in hell.
I curse you.
Don't get angry, Mr. Brahmam.
Kantham!
Kantham! Kantham!
Stupid fellow! Wait!
Must you arrive at this moment?
Come! come!
I was a fool to speak ill to you.
Forgive this sinner and get that out.
- What? - Lingam! Aatmalingam!
Is this all your sketch?
But before that, you all must close your eyes and pray.
Close your eyes.
Please...
Mr. Brahmam is running away. Chase him. Chase him.
Come, come.
Why is Mr. Brahmam running away?
What should we do now?
In its stomach.
Then where is the Aatmalingam?
In his stomach.

Come out, let's have a drink together. What do you fear about now?
Kasi, come out, please. Let's have a drink together.
Coming.
Bloody, coward!
Hey!

Hey!

but you must display a posh outlook, is it?
I would live my last moments on my terms.
Come, Savitri, let's live our life on our terms.
They call him something. What is that?
Are you Bedurulanka's Chiranjeevi?
You, bald head!
Hey, original! Original!
Today onwards, I am Bedurulanka's Chiranjeevi.
Today onwards, I am Bedurulanka's Chiranjeevi. Only me.
Who am I?
Bedurulanka's Chiranjeevi.

Hey... Move aside.
Siri! Siri!
Siri, please forgive me.
Look, that bald guy influenced me.
But I truly love only you.
Forgive me and I'll die peacefully.
Did you forgive me?
I'm thankful that you forgave me.
Shiva, I feel so relaxed.
like riding the Titanic on the river Godavari.
I love this feeling so much. I'm high even though I'm not high.
Why are you staring at me?
How delightful I am.
Come, Siri.
If you bring out your original self not even death can scare you.
Lust, anger, greed, temptations, pride, and envy are Arishadvargas.
They stop us from discovering the truth and make our lives miserable.
But we are fortunate that,
You would be blessed with a human life...
Move aside...
You should be killed.
You made them Godmen with your superstition.
Gentlemen, please forgive us. We made a mistake. Please forgive us.
Please forgive me.
I utilised the foolishness of Mr. President...
Yes.
I should do that.
Kantham! Come.
What does this bald-head want from Kantham?
What?
Shameless fellow.
We have a son too.
- Come here. - A climax full of twists!
Brother!
But I declare it to everyone, he is my brother.
I'm going to marry Kantham right here, right now.
Do you vermillion, Mr. Priest?
Go, marry her.
I have two mothers. I have two mothers.
Suseela, forgive me. I used to visit Kantham too.
Gosh!
But Kantham used to understand them without me telling her anything.
Sundaram, I too had fantasies...
but I felt awkward sharing them with you.
- Forgive me, brother. - Hey!
What the hell!
Forgive me, dad...
Forgive me, daughter-in-law
I was jealous seeing my son closer to you...
That's why I stole your necklace and made him beat you for losing it.
What?
I never knew this village had so much stink.
I killed my dad, Father.
I give you all my properties. Throw that umbrella away and die as a landlord.
Here, these are deities' ornaments. I had stolen them.
Hey, who are you guys?
You exiled me because I didn't give my two rings.

a lot of reading.
so I'm really hoping to hear back.

Let's do it.

You too?
So you've seen her.
I don't know, I was hoping you knew.
I've never had to deal with something like this.
Yeah well they're both dead
so that's not going to help us.
No.
You never try to communicate,
But we can't just pretend like this isn't happening.
No, of course not.
Maybe grandma will know what to do?
Grandma?
Got any better ideas?
No, I guess not.
How's your mother doing?
Yeah, that's always been your mother.
Ever since I can remember,
she was making her own money, always working,
even when she was in school.
You remind me so much of her.
Unfortunately, not all men
can handle strong women with Patience.
Your father has always been battling his demons.
No.
So angry at him, I wouldn't wanna talk to him anyway.
It's okay to be angry.
Just don't let that lead to bitterness sentiment, okay?
So, about this thing
Man, that was fun.
Yeah, me too.
Can't you call it off?
so that maybe I can afford to go abroad
during the winter break.
Really?
That sounds exciting,
You should.
There's a whole world outside of the valley
Yeah, I hear ya.
But my favorite seasonal experience, Autumn in the midwest.
It sounds like it.
Anyway, back to reality.
Yeah.
Wanna do a few more laps?
Let's do it.
All right, sounds good.
that have been happening to us?
especially here, in this region.
This,
this is a haunted valley.
the streets, and the alleyways,
looking for a dwelling place.
He's prowling around, like a roaring lion,
looking for someone to devour.
The devil?
And his demons.
I just thought the devil is supposed to be in hell.
Then you'd be wrong.
Hell was created for him, sure,
but he and his angels dwell amongst us
He was even tempted by the devil.
Well, we're all seeing some kind of human-like entity,
not some kind of devil or demon.
The devil can take any form he wants.
Couldn't it just be the restless spirit
of a woman who passed here in the area?
until awakened by god himself
when the day of judgment arrives.
that demonic force continues to impersonate that person
It wanders the streets,
looking for someone else to attach itself to.
How do you know if you have an attachment?
They go through an entire lifetime without ever knowing.
If you are seeing a physical manifestation of the spirit,
then it's a good sign because it means
it is still prowling around.
However, it is also very dangerous
that it has targeted your family.
What?
You must remain vigilant.
How?
The enemy tries to find ways to gain access into your home
from the love and protection of god.
See, we are empty vessels.
with bitterness, greed, hate, anger, lust,
which are open invitations to unclean spirits of the world.
Remain vigilant.
You know, I don't think
I've ever taken this path home before.
Yeah, it's a bit faster.
The what?
The old Miller house?
No.
Well, it's only supposed to be
What?
Yeah.
Why?
but as the legend has it,
Mrs. Miller became very depressed
after suffering the loss of a child.
Her husband, Mr. Miller, tried to get her help.
that were telling her to hurt herself.
Unfortunately, her husband wasn't able to help her.
She became lost in her loneliness.
After that, Mr. Miller was never the same again.
Anyway, it's just a ghost legend.
Yeah.
Bethany.
Just get to the point.
Uh, I'm not uh,
we uh, we'd like to get married.
Well I hope she knows what she's getting into.
Yeah.
send you the uh, divorce papers.
That way we can finalize this thing and uh,
Listen, I was hoping you could do me a favor and uh,
share the news with the kids for me?
Let 'em know yourself.
So um, do you believe any of that?
Yeah.
How about the ghost part?
I don't know, I'm sure there's some truth to the stories.
Have you ever experienced anything paranormal before?
I don't know.
I can't say I have.
Have you?
Uh...
oh my goodness, you have, haven't you?
I'd rather you not think
I envy you.
Trust me, you do not wanna experience anything paranormal.
Well, maybe just a little.

A PRINCE
He was a delicate child
and very beautiful.
He never complained.
Perhaps I wasn't prepared to listen.
I never gave much thought to Kutta's mother or father.
but I believed them to be dead.
I wasn't really capable of great tenderness.
I was always afraid he might break.
He always came home from school with good grades,
and he had no difficulty speaking French.
which was, after all, purely imaginary,
My father, who ran a nursery in Sussex,
had given me a French destiny,
I returned regularly to England to visit him
and to bring back perennials from his nursery
which were still quite rare in France.
when I came across this study
based on some tests they carried out.
When I saw that, I thought it was so beautiful.
It's like a musical score.
I want to make that real,
I want to make it concrete

He works on some of the estates in Varengeville-sur-Mer.
and wasn't short of advice for me.
He had embarked on a crazy botanical project
When I took over the school,
I saw all sorts of kids arriving from very different backgrounds.
Inspired and inscrutable.
In short,
he was the first child, before Kutta,

"It's your last chance," I was warned.

I was a shy, introverted child.
and I suffered from recurring nightmares

I can no longer bear

My mother has always been an avid reader
of British and American fantasy novels.
She was convinced that a spirit she called Roger

How is Pierre-Joseph getting on?
It's for a wedding.
at the training and apprenticeship college in Yvetot,
the 32 pairs of eyes watching me
Pierre-Joseph looked the other way.
He caught me unawares.
The morning dragged,
in spite of the optimistic tone I was trying
"Because of your passion for plants and books, Alberto.
"Because you are well travelled.
"from your direct observation of landscapes and people,
"at home, where they are at."
"This is a special year."
Indeed it was! The child her marriage had denied her
had just arrived.
I was touched by the young Kutta,
by his thin face with its mix of Indian and Tibetan traits,
his light-brown skin over a frail body,
like so many others I had seen
like a plant, how could I not think that,
He said nothing.
despite being on the receiving end from his classmates.
of all the children in my care.
My mother threw my father out of the house.
He sought refuge in his hunting lodge in Hugleville-en-Caux
a few kilometres from the house,
The lodge was always full of hunting friends.
Their passion was to drink and eat.
Sometimes I found my cousin there
and we made love.
He had an attractive cock with a pert glans,
a nice belly to set it off,
and balls that nestled nicely between his thighs.

And you have to identify an animal footprint.
Or, in a hunting situation,
I became friends with Alberto, my botany teacher,
My mother kept threatening to kill us, my father and I,
or to commit suicide.
and begged me to push her down them.
Hello.
I tried to stop her drinking,
and there wasn't much I could do.
Françoise encouraged my mother to let me carry on.
To convince her, she told her I was an artist,
How much?
Okay.
Goodbye.
Yes, I'm fine.
Yes.
I filmed in Bhopal. We arrived in the night.
I heard horns honking. I could see lorries in the distance.
And I thought...
And it was very moving.
And I thought of that boy I was trying to find.
We ran towards one another.
We hugged one another and cried.
I had met a boy who was already
never to return.
I had been that boy,
capable of telling barefaced lies,
of betrayal without remorse,
to feel a steady hand weighing on my body.
Alberto had initiated me in love, in the names of flowers,
and in poets such as Novalis and Denys.
He sent me his first collection of poems,
It was accompanied by a letter
telling me he'd be spending the summer in Portugal
to take him back to Yvetot,
Mino came in my mouth.
to hide in my father's dirty laundry cupboard
to inhale the piss-stained crotch
of his white Eminence underpants,
remembering Sunday evenings at the house
when, on returning from the hunt,
The water caused his penis to swell and he stroked it,
which to me seemed
I wanted to live in the cabin.
My mother was strongly opposed to the idea.
The cabin had been burgled,
I felt at peace there.
The cabin had been violated,
and it was a relief.
All that remained was a photograph.
I turned the image upside-down
to give the hares some dignity back.
Saint Hubert's Chapel,
dedicated to the animals slaughtered by my forefathers.
- Hello, Mr Aubry. - Hello.
Here.
- Hello. - Pierre-Joseph,
Odile!
- Hello. - Hello there.
He's come to work for you, as part of his apprenticeship.
Great.
Come on, then. We'll show you round the greenhouses.
My new employer was called Mr Aubry.
Adrien!
Kutta often had skin problems.
His skin was so delicate,
I remember the doctor suggesting at the time
The child flatly refused,
reassuring me that he was fine,
and he wasn't at all worried.
What is this yellow?
Piss and linseed oil.
I had left the cabin
to sleep at her mother's house.
Sometimes she allowed me, lying to her mother,
to spend the night with Alberto.
Sylvie worked in a bookshop
where she regularly saw Françoise,
sometimes accompanied by her adoptive son.
That's how, every now and again, I heard news of Kutta.
"Rosier Evêque."
"Rosier Cuspidé."
A beautiful plant.
You need to leave...
If you don't get enough of the root,
the dandelions grow back.
Listen, you've brought me luck.
I could cry.
I've managed to cultivate quillworts!
There's a huge clump here.
It's incredible.
There are more!
It's this, these little rosettes.
That's it.
A place of ill repute.
I met my previous ex there too.
He went to Jean Rostand college.
He's really into horticulture and all that.
But...
so there was nothing to build on.
You know what they say about narcissism.
Being narcissistic is the opposite of self-love.
It's a lack of self-esteem.
What about you?
You turn me on.
On Saturdays I went with Adrien
to Pavilly market to sell plants.
We left early enough to give us time to make love
before getting set up.
The market stall opposite ours
belonged to a beekeeper called Moïse.
He was a sturdy man.
When you passed his stall,
an enthusiasm amongst the students.
As for Pierre-Joseph, he remained silent.
Then, sometime later, one night after making love,
I heard him murmur:
"Yes. We'll make a film."
Adrien gave me five weeks off
to go with Alberto to film the Himalayan flora.
Alberto would film the flowers and I would draw them.
We were excited when we got there,
to find the flowers that we grow in our gardens,
such as Macleaya cordata and Meconopsis.
"when the walker finally understands
"that even though the path always leads back home,
It was really quite beautiful.
That part was very beautiful.
"Alberto, you feel bored in town.
"and it will be more convenient for seeing Pierre-Joseph."
as taking a stray animal into the house.
We screened "Memory of a Garden" in the school courtyard.
In contrast with the noisy wonderment of his classmates,
Kutta's distress was palpable.
The landscapes were imprinted on him,
Kutta was a very handsome young man now.
He had decided to embark on a trip to India.
He didn't suggest we make the trip with him.
at a distance from my heart,
I was scared of losing him.
retreating into his search for a new birth
Kutta was imbued with something invisible
that he was dedicating himself to.
It gave him a certain haughtiness,
a combination of arrogance and contemplation.
After Odile died
I suggested to Moïse,
that he place some hives in the woods.
He taught me the first principles of beekeeping.
I was fascinated.
His strength, gentleness, and love of bees
Come, Ordet.
Come!
Where did you learn to draw?
I told them it was 50 years since...
It's cold.
- Eh? - It's nice and cold.
It's nice and cold.
His heart gave up.
in Rue de l'Oiseau Bleu in Saint-Wandrille
Now that Moïse was dead,
I took care of his orphaned colonies.
Pierre-Joseph had grown older.
He had no difficulty finding clients
who had frequented Adrien's nursery.
Like lots of local people,
she was passionate about horticulture
where she collected all sorts of climbing plants,
especially Akebia
which proliferated among the endemic creepers
commonly known in France as "battered wives' herb".
this woman of the soil
"My client with Akebia quinata hair."
She exerted a sort of fascination over him
and over the course of his visits
He dreamed of a black house
above a sea of brambles and roses.
In this forest, like any enclosed space,
so I naturally set my sights on the far edge of the forest,
that we began to clear "Le Roncier"
for our "Black Maria".
Five metres by six.
All made of wood, resting on stilts,
with a corrugated iron roof and weatherboard cladding.
about a small ad in "L'Union Agricole"
for a gardening job at the Valmont estate.
and felt it was his mission to save it.
I thought of you," he said.
"I remember your arrival in France," I said.
"I like the silences between us," he said behind my back.
As for me, I was embarrassed by his youth and beauty.
he suddenly asked me.
"My Renaissance château would make a good backdrop, no?"
The prince told me about his sleepless nights,
about how, stretched out on his bed,
he'd binge-watched all 73 episodes
but also to amateur BDSM porn videos
which prevented me from taking any pleasure in our session.
The next morning I demanded an explanation.
He tied himself in knots,
telling me the dog had been abandoned
by the previous Mafia owners.
for fear that it might run away.
I felt sick.
It's okay, dog. It's okay.
I have almost 15,000 followers.
[mockingly] I have over 15,000 followers.
[Kali] Well, what do you have? Like, three?
Only for another month. I'm about to move on campus.
Yeah.
R-- remind me, uh, who's paying for that...
campus housing?
Tuition?
Well, at least I don't live at home after college like you.
You, on the other hand,
are completely dependent on Mom and Dad.
Correct?
we're talking about right now.
The defense rests, your honor.
[Meredith] To that point, counselor...
Hey, why aren't you guys watching the news right now?
Why?
There's cops and reporters everywhere on our street.
-It's fucking-- -Oh, L-- Lindsay.
I thought we lived in, like, the safest area.
people get murdered every day.
<i>...was found in her bedroom</i>
-[Lindsay] Holy shit. -Oh, my God.
Oh, Barbara.
[Kali] Barbara?
Dr. B., remember?
Oh, yeah.
How sad.
[Dan] How do we define who's at fault?
<i>Or the murderer?</i>
[Tommy] To me, it seems like...
Palsgraf would be a good example here.
onto the train, uh...
an independent act of negligence
on the employee or the company,
um, which breaks the chain of causation.
I meant in regards to criminal cases, not civil.
And I certainly hope on the exam
when you answer questions, you give more concise answers.
Don't just regurgitate the court's opinion.
It's the law.
Palsgraf establishes
[Kelsey] Back up, Bryce,
the guy can barely even walk right.
Let's just calm down here.
Okay?
Tommy, that was a valiant effort.
having your dad as the guest lecturer.
All right, I think we are done for today.
[Olivia] Must be tough being Dan Olson's progeny.
You have no idea.
Maybe this will help. I'm, uh...
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm Olivia.
-Tommy. -Nice to meet you.
Well, um, after today,
So, uh,
Jude and Teel, huh?
Hey.
Leave me alone, Dad.
if you brought up Palsgraf in a criminal trial.
Just trying to help you.
Let me do you a favor. I don't need your help.
You wouldn't be in this law school
[sighs] Look, I talked to your professor.
Don't worry.
-Hey. -Thank you again for today.
Are we still on for next week?
-Yeah. Absolutely. -Great. Looking forward to it.
Absolutely.
Hey.
-Kelsey, right? -Yes, hi.
You graduate in May?
-Uh, Pritzker Law. -I can read.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
So, why us?
Uh, well, I got your information
from a classmate in school,
and after doing my research, I--
Allow me to rephrase.
You're Dan Olson's son.
You already have an in to the largest firm in the city.
Well, yes, my father's firm is...
very successful...
I prefer to follow my own path.
If you wanted to pave your own path...
uh, everyone has--
I-- I wanna help the innocent.
And if they're not?
-[Tommy] Not what? -Innocent.
That's my job.
You know what? I respect that, kid.
This could work.
Especially with our unfinished business.
Low pay, long hours, could be a good place
I have a case in mind, actually.
With all due respect, um, Miss Jude--
Ms. Jude. I'm married to the firm.
Right, uh, Ms. Jude...
[Kevin] Higher paying?
Uh, correct.
That you'll get lost in a backroom somewhere
with no opportunities to show us the value you can bring?
Cold cases are old, yes.
And tough to conclude,
Families will get closure...
You think you can handle the pressure?
<i>Tommy! Tommy!</i>
Oh, uh, thank you.
Thank-- thank you for your time and I--
Uh, Jane...
I don't want to crack down.
like that shit you told me--
Jane, I'm-- I'm seeing things and--
and-- and no one believes me.
You've been saying this for weeks.
Really?
-Hey! -Jesus, Olson. Watch out.
Bryce, what the fuck are you doing here?
Fucking Bryce.
Jesus Christ.
Call it.
Dr. Sims...
Even if we work all night to try to keep her stable,
she's gonna be crippled.
Barbara.
I'm on my small break.
Hello.
Hello?
How can I help you?
Yeah, uh, that-- that sounds amazing, um...
Is there an offer I'll-- I'll receive?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey.
[Olivia chuckles] Quit your daydreaming.
You get your first trial by fire.
about the terms of my position.
Uh, you know what?
um, but you can wait in the conference room
Great.
Hey, by the way,
The associates?
[scoffs] Rookie, it's day one.
You'll get there someday.
-You coming? -Yeah.
-Nice. -Yeah.
Uh, Kristen should be here shortly.
Okay.
-See you around? -Yeah.
[Kristen] Tommy.
Thank you for this opportunity.
I have your paperwork to sign so you can start right away.
You, uh-- you mean cases?
Uh, yeah.
No, no, I-- I'm not saying that.
I definitely want the job.
Then sign.
Uh, I'm assuming, uh, there are benefits?
Of course we have benefits.
Once you bill. As in bill each client?
Oh. Yeah.
I'm late for a conference call. Let me show you to your office.
When do I, uh, start?
Now.
and probably many nights.
Oh, I'm-- I'm used to long hours.
-Liv, I made your favorite. -Oh!
Bok choy tonight.
Yay! Can't wait. [chuckles]
I fucking hate bok choy.
[chuckles] Uh, she cooks for you?
Yeah. Only on Thursdays when I'm actually home.
-Are you two rel-- -Adopted.
I am.
I got a job today.
Yeah, Tommy, that's really awesome.
[Meredith] Not nice.
But seriously, the way the sun comes into your room
is perfect for my sun salutations.
Which firm?
Kirkland and Ellis? Mackenzie?
Those are the only two you should be looking into.
I mean, if you had half a brain,
Tommy, he is not judging you. Your father's trying to help.
Jude and Teel.
I closed around our house today.
You didn't tell me that.
You never asked.
Dad. He got a job.
You should be proud of him.
I would be proud of him
if he got hired by a real law firm.
We did not send you to school
like Jude and whatever the fuck it is.
It-- it's not the right firm,
it's-- it's not Kirkland and Ellis,
I am-- I-- your crippled son fell again.
-[Meredith] Honey-- -Run to your room, loser.
-Dad! -[Meredith] Dan.
When you make the money, you make the rules.
Kali!
Kali!
-What the hell, Tommy? -Did you do this?
[Lindsay] Guys, what is all the yelling?
-Some people are sleeping. -So stupid.
[Tommy] Look at-- look at the mirror!
There was blood. There was--
See what? Your face? Your face is--
Look at my--
Your hands look completely normal, okay?
I mean, it was-- it was there.
You're fine, okay?
Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on.
Please.
and still having goddamn childhood nightmares.
Damn it!
Not now, Meredith.
This is your fault.
You're sorry?
You're sorry?
Out of whiskey.
Not this late you won't.
Well, I-- I drive at night all the time when you're away.
You're not going nowhere.
Understand me?
[choking] You're right.
-You're right. -Good.
[scoffs] What a joke.
[laughing] God.
Jesus Christ.
How is the first assignment going?
Old cases that never got resolved.
as lawyers, we are bound to ethical practices.
technically, you're not a lawyer yet.
Are you asking me to do something unethical?
on all the witness accounts of the unresolved cases.
I'll be in my office but only till 6:00.
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Something...
[Tommy] I think I found something interesting.
Uh, the cases you gave me,
uh, four of them happened in River Oaks.
And, uh, after doing a little discovery,
I found that the maid that was poisoned
um, of young women.
I found a-- a photo of her
with one of the victims.
and turning it over to, uh, detectives.
Great work.
I am interested in your take on the other files,
...informational, uh, wise.
I need you to focus
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Jane's on a diet,
but I'm still gonna grab some grub at Jim and Pete's.
You want to tag along?
Uh, yeah.
maybe not, I-- I think I've--
I think I just stumbled onto something.
Your epiphany's not going anywhere,
but my Tesla is, so.
-Tesla? -Mm-hmm.
You know, you just started here.
So you haven't been introduced
to the two main facts of working here.
Oh, which are?
One you get to set your own hours and lunch.
-[Tommy] And two? -And two,
Jim and Pete's has the best cheesy bread.
Wow.
-So good. -Monstrous.
You know, I just can't help but feel like
if those poor bastards had Google,
I'm not so sure about that.
It takes a keen eye.
You know, this job isn't for everyone.
It takes a toll, you know what I mean?
Yeah, I-- I guess.
It's just crazy to think...
Bryce was just interviewing for my job,
and now he's sitting in a morgue.
So were your two friends?
No, no.
Even in high school.
Stupid thing.
Yeah.
I think these lockers are from, like, 1812.
I like your backpack.
Yo, come on, Bryce.
-[laughing] -Hoppy Tommy and Mouse Milly.
You two freaks are perfect for each other.
falling for his little girlfriend?
It's-- it's fine. Just a little blood.
I'm Milly.
Tommy.
Tommy, do you like the rain?
The only person that liked Bryce was Bryce.
Sounds like it was pretty rough when you were younger, huh?
But nothing that
Yeah. [chuckles]
Should we be worried?
What do you think?
[whispering] Kali.
Kali.
Kali.
Kali.
Kali.
[Lindsay] Sorry.
What happened to your face?
No, I-- I'm fine.
[Kali] Why are you guys in my room?
Why are you wearing my clothes?
I have one, too.
Oh, my God, did you fuck a mountain lion or something?
I-- I-- I just was--
You look like shit.
Oh, yeah.
That's what my friends do.
Yeah, your friends are hardly normal.
Tommy, let's-- let's get you cleaned up, okay?
No, look, I'm-- I'm fine.
You're not fine. You have scratches all over your face.
[Meredith] Morning, I got some fresh bagels, I made eggs.
Scrambled, of course, you know, I can't--
Honey, what happened?
I'm fine. [chuckles]
I told him
not to go drinking last night, but...
a really rough night, and I...
I just want something to drink and go to work.
for a different reason.
We just don't think this firm is the best thing for--
Well, it's a good thing you two don't work there.
a negative impact on your mental and physical health.
you're not eating, and now you come home
with cuts all over your face?
Mom, it's not the job
that's the problem, Mom.
It's Dad.
I can't stand to live here anymore.
And I...
I-- I-- I don't know how you stand it either.
Please show some respect, you two.
and now he makes me feel like I'm not worthy enough
Tommy, that is not true, okay?
[Meredith] Tommy, he loves our family.
-[Meredith] He loves our family! -Mom. Mom.
I'm gonna go talk to him. Just stay here.
Tommy. Tommy, wait up.
Tommy. [panting]
Sorry about Mom.
Well, she's not. What is it? I'm late for work.
Look, she's a mom.
She's supposed to be worried, it's her job.
Oh, God, Tommy, you need a new bandage.
-I'm fine. -[Lindsay] Look...
-Dr. Gunderson? -[Lindsay] He helped me.
[Tommy] When?
When we were kids.
Things I don't want to remember about our parents.
Well, all right.
How about we start with...
Well, I've-- I've been having these nightmares,
just...
pull them out of my memory
or-- or get me to forget,
or I-- I don't even know, help.
Okay, um...
I don't know.
Um, maybe, I...
Ah, yes. Lindsay, right?
Yes.
Well, then, with your permission...
I'll just ask you a few questions,
and perhaps we can
get a deeper understanding
Well...
Like, wave a watch or something, um--
or some breathing yoga thing.
No, not exactly.
I'm gonna ask you three questions...
Should-- should I close my eyes?
It's up to you.
I'm just going to ask you
and a moment with someone who made you feel safe.
Easy. Calm down. It's okay.
Jesus, son, you're ice cold.
Hey, slow down, easy.
<i>Who hit who?</i> <i>Are you in trouble?</i>
<i>We-- we were walking</i> <i>on the street</i>
What girl?
The girl from school.
Did anybody see you?
I-- I-- I don't know.
Yeah, yeah.
All right?
We have to call the police.
It's you and me, son.
I'm sorry, Tommy, I don't think I can help you.
And I would like you to leave, please.
What do you mean? We just started.
I-- I-- I am not comfortable.
-I-- -Dr. Gunderson, please.
Good luck.
Please. Leave.
[eerily] Tommy.
So, did you find the Zodiac Killer?
[chuckles] Not yet.
This place is crazy.
Jesus.
Look, I can't even read this.
for anyone else but me.

I appreciate the Miranda.
Welcome to the club.
Hey, detective.
-[Tommy] Hey. -Got some more for you.
Making any headway on the hit-and-run?
I recently found out
that the doctor that made the report was a Barbara Simms.
Uh, I saw her on the news.
She had been murdered.
Great.
[man] Tommy, you okay?
[Jane] These cases are--
No, I won't...
if you give me a hit.
You don't. You don't smoke, do you?
Aren't you worried about the staff finding out?
No.
Nobody cares. Neither do I.
Having a bad day?
I just needed something to take the edge off.
I think I recognized that girl in the photo.
No, the one on her desk.
Wait, you-- you told me on my first day
Yeah, I-- I acted like I didn't see anything
Jane thought I was fucking crazy.
Damn.
<i>in regards</i> <i>to the ongoing murders...</i>
[Kali] It's like <i>The Purge</i> out there.
in this murder market.
Tommy, will you take this jacket off so I can iron it?
[chuckles] Your hair's a mess.
-Mom, stop. -[Lindsay] Guys.
<i>Brutal discovery this morning</i> <i>as a man identified</i>
<i>underneath a vehicle</i> <i>in his auto repair shop.</i>
<i>I don't know, Kit, this stuff</i>

[Kit] <i>As reports</i> <i>are still coming in,</i>

No, no, I'm just
taken aback by how horrific it is.
<i>In the meanwhile, everybody,</i>
Uh, let's change the channel, okay?
[Tommy] Moxley was acquitted from the chop shop case.
It's okay.
You're obviously distracted by your work.
Yeah.
No, you're-- you're not gonna believe this, but, uh...
What are you--
Tommy! Tommy, are you okay?
[Tommy] I'm-- I'm-- I'm good. I'm-- I'm-- I'm good.
-It's okay-- I'm-- I'm here. -[Tommy] I'm sorry-- No, uh--
Sorry. Uh, I'm--
You know, everybody keeps saying they want to help me,
and-- and-- and it's making me feel like I'm going crazy.
[sniffs] and I'm-- I'm seeing things.
But someone has your arms down...
Yeah, my grandma used to say that dreams and nightmares
have the same people in them.
[distorted] We must make Dad happy.
Dad?
No, it's-- it's okay. It's okay.
And, look, we're-- we have each other's back.
-Right? -Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay.
[Meredith] Tommy?
Tommy?
I'm sleeping.
Clearly, you're awake if you're responding.
Tommy, I just want to make sure you're okay.
Why, um...
Why-- why did you lie?
and I wish--
but I can't, so, um,
all you need to know is that I love you, okay?
I, um, yeah,
Always do.
[female anchor] <i>Another suspected murder</i>
<i>More details coming up.</i>
<i>The victim has been identified</i>

Hi. Sheriff Evans.

You said, black Escalade?
Where were we?
Are you okay, kid?
A-- a-- a family emergency. I have to go.

Uh, yeah. Yeah, actually, I-- I do.
Well, would you mind filling me in?
Because the kid needs help.
He just ran out of here
like he saw a ghost or something.
But he does need help.
Where-- where-- where's Lindsay?
Hey, what the hell, asshole?
-Look, someone... -Give that back.

Okay, so you have amnesia.
[Tommy] That is not what I'm saying.
May-- maybe it is.
Okay. Okay. So, you admit it.
No, it's not drugs!
Tommy, you look at yourself, you have all this pent-up anger.
You're yelling at Mom, you're--
I am coming to you.
I-- I'm coming to my sister.
you know, I-- I've-- I've tried.
I've tried.
You know, I did-- I did what you told me to do!
It didn't work.

You're my son.

And you-- and you paid the sheriff
You lied to me.
I-- I came--
I came to your office to-- to--
for your help.
Not for this!
You-- you made me a criminal.
-I lied to you. -You did it for yourself.
She was driving, not me.
-Mom, is this true? -Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, please. Tommy.
Tommy, look at me.
Tommy.
Please, Tommy. Tommy.
[Tommy] Get away from me!
Tommy.
I'm sorry.
I forgive you.
I didn't do anything.
You're so fucking jealous and stupid.
-This is on you. This is on you. -[gasps]
Dan. What happened to your father?
Dan, say something.
It was me.
Tommy, I'm so sorry.
[Jane] You requested to see me?
You don't get any fucking favors.
What if I confess to the rest of them?
What do you want in return?
Spare Tommy.
You're willing to let the person
who attacked all those other people
You know, Meredith,
Me standing right where I am...
and you standing right where you are.
all I see is a mother without a daughter.
You be careful in there.
I think it was too soon.
Here.
What's this?
[Tommy] Oh, it's everything you'll need.
Uh, house, accounts.
Yeah.
[Kali] Just because dad was like this
does not mean that you have to be, too.
Everyone I get close to...
And I-- I just--
or anyone.
I, uh...
this is goodbye.
-Tommy. Wait! -[Tommy sniffles]
Everything that I...
Listen, I know that there are things
that we will never be able to understand.
But you're my brother.
And we're the only family that we have left.
I could never forgive myself.
[sniffles] I'd tell Olivia the same thing.
But I don't think she'd get it.
I'm sorry, Kal...
but this is goodbye.
I am eating some "toona".
<i>"Toona"? You mean "tuna".</i>
<i>You're gonna turn into a tuna.</i>
That's disgusting. Look, when are you home?
What?
It's the bath.
It was hanging out the window.
No, thank you.
<i>Like a really nice camper van.</i>
Hi.
Hello, you.
<i>...face</i> <i>of somebody who looked like</i>
Fuck.
Oh!
What's going on?
<i>Hello.</i> <i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>
<i>is currently in heavy demand.</i> <i>We will respond as soon</i>
<i>You're currently in the queue.</i>
Push.
Hello.
Who are you?
so please refrain from charging any mobile phones or devices.
It doesn't feel real, does it?
- Did it hurt? - No.
We've got to get everybody off this floor now.
'Cause you're amazing.
Okay, yeah, got it.
...you need to bring baby to you,
Out the city? Space for baby?
Yes.
Okay.
We can't go home.
You okay? Fuck. I'm pulp.
Can you turn the tap on, please?
We love you.
- Percy. - What, like the...
Woody. Woody. Mm-mm. No.
Zeb. Yeah.
Careful with this bit.
<i>of the country submerged,</i> <i>and with reports...</i>
Jesus Christ.
Come on!
Does it hurt? Yeah.
It feels like someone's, like, staple-gunning my nipples.
That's not possible. Well, he does.
<i>because schools and gyms</i> <i>are full...</i>
My parents have lived here for 35 years.
Please.
Been sitting here for ages.
- Hey. - Hey.
- Yeah. - Oh, God.
Well, the networks are down, Mum.
- Hey. - Right.
We've got someone for you to meet.
Who's laughing now, eh?
They just got here. Hey.
I... I'll go and start this.
It's her son.
- How's the ark? - Er, pretty mouldy.
What happened to our home?
The street was gone. But, but... we build a new home.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Here we go.
Okay, okay, okay.
Ow, Zeb, ow.
Baby. Baby. Mum.
I'm sorry yours isn't here.
Has the cork always been here?
What, not even of maps? Or fish? The periodic table?
We just fucked last time.
With our hands over each other's mouths.
<i>but aid workers</i> <i>say vital supplies</i>
Is it hurting?
<i>In an urgent appeal,</i> <i>they have warned people</i>
<i>and have pleaded for restraint</i>
<i>following outbreaks</i> <i>of violence and looting.</i>
<i>as well</i> <i>as emergency accommodation.</i>
Supplies are low. Roads are blocked.
We live on an island. On an island.
I'm sorry. This...
I know.
Hey.
Bye.
Anyone seen the shopping bag?
No, wait, It's all right. Found it.
No, no, no.
Love you!
Hey.
And they had this summer romance
And he's got this, like, this gang, the T-Birds.
I mean, he's basically...
Fuck.
Is your house...
I'm sorry.
We'll fix this.
We'll go home and you'll grow tall and strong and kind,
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It wasn't quick.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Okay. Grandad's going for a walk.
Babe?
<i>We can't stay here.</i>
<i>There's no food anyway.</i>
I'm sorry.
I just... I...
I just...
I just can't do it.
I love you.
I love you.
Stop pushing!
Get back!
That's why I'm saying I'll go.
No. You're his food. You're his whole ecosystem.
Just wait. I can do it. Just give me a minute.
Stop pushing!
- Move back. Move back. - Stay where you are.
Okay.
...you've been waiting many hours outside,
We can only accept children and one primary carer.
No, you have to.
If you're here, you're safe.
'Cause...
I can't protect you or Zeb,
We stay together.
We stay together.
<i>Unknown vehicle</i> <i>arriving at the gate. Over.</i>
<i>So, it's shelter 26.</i> <i>It's breakfast at 7:00.</i>
so it's cold showers only, I'm afraid.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
There we go.
- Baby, baby. - Just do it.
Come on, baby boy.
<i>We would remind you,</i>
What you looking at?
<i>Shelter 27,</i> <i>lunch is now postponed.</i>
Hey. Ooh!
You think you're clever?
Have you taken my pillow?
Move your hands off. That's my fucking pillow!
- Enough! - It's my pillow!
You two, behave yourselves.
It's just sewage and dead animals.
And we almost left it too late.
but she's gotta stay cute.
There are worse places.
We were in one before here and a refuge before that.
she had to leave. Raiders stole all her food.
Too slow. Oh!
He's probably dead.
He can't swim.
I hope it was quick.
You know what? You go.
Fuck!
Fuck's sake.
For God's sake.
Come on. Come on.
Come here.
Yes!
The trees!
What's that?
That's a thing. That's how she talks.
Okay.
before they spoke about the economy on breakfast television.
She had some sort of epiphany one day.
More like, "Oh, fuck. What am I doing with my life?"
Just have to figure out how to get there.
You should come.
What?
Move! Move! Move!
- Oi, oi, look at this. - A few more over here.
- Bring that bag. - I've got this one.
Faster. Check in there, man.
Check in there.
- Just drive. - Come on.
- Fuck. - Go, go, go!
Can you slow down? Please?
Actually, we can get out here.
I'm here. I'm here.
Cunts.
I feel sick.
We have these delicious babies.
We'll find something.
There's no food.
It's all right. Come on.
Hi.
Here.
Thank you.
We're heading to my friend's commune.
But... ...she might have stopped.
- You've been to one? - Yeah.
Because they wanted to forget.
And...
I don't want to forget before, so...
It was my fault.
at the end.
in her arms, and then they weren't there.
It's fine. I don't speak to people for days on end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Why are you so awake?
Again? No?
Oh, no, we did that?
This is it. The northern pier.
She will.
She will come.
She will come.
Hey.
She will come.
Fuck.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello! We're here!
Hi!
Oh, you made it.
Hello. Oh, my God, you're here.
What?
Now?
And this is my friend. Hiya!
Mine looks better than yours.
<i>the worst of the extreme storms</i> <i>have finally passed.</i>
<i>This long-awaited news</i> <i>has paved the way</i>
<i>for the launch</i> <i>of the official operation</i>
<i>to begin rebuilding our nation.</i>
<i>which he believes will be</i> <i>achievable in the coming weeks.</i>
Course.
Thank you. Sorry.
I had this breakdown, I guess.
overwhelmed by the fear of dying.
Doesn't sound irrational.
it offered no real threat and...
God, I couldn't get out of bed.
I mean, he looked after me so brilliantly.
I went on this mad "I want a baby" quest.
Just head down, get pregnant.
But I think I only wanted one
that I would die for in a heartbeat, in a second.
Sounds okay.
He was wanted.
A version of him was wanted.
No. It spreads.
Pulls the baby in.
And now look.
I'm more of a, kind of, "Build your own hut, eat and kill some roadkill".
- Normal. The normal way. - Yeah.
Mm. Like going into shops, and ordering food from menus
Or even a microwave. I'm not...
Yeah. Yeah, there's... there's no hope.
You're not here.
Sorry.
They have more to give up.
It stops working for everybody if one person isn't present.
What you miss doesn't exist.
I'm just... just, like, having a moment, you know?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Girls, come and eat your soup.
It's delicious.
Thank you.
of the world and everyone in it.
Home. I'm going home.
Please don't go.
Don't go.
You can't go alone.
I'll be fine. It's not about you.
This is a commune.
We exist for our community, for those who opt in,
who choose to be in our community
I'll take you first thing.
I don't like goodbyes.
Sorry.
You might die.
Right, um...
Okay.
- Goodnight. - Sleep well.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
Hello.
Will you carry me now, please?
Huh?
Hey, hello.
Hello.
Can we...
No.
- Er, please. - No.
- I just... - No.
- No, no, no, no. - Shut up.
Just let go.
Just let go.
No!
Get out! Get out!
- Get out! - Get her out the fucking...
You can't tell anyone I did that.
You look very unimpressed.
I repeat, volunteers only.
willing to work in exchange for food and shelter.
You need to have identification. Please have it ready.
If you have identification, please have it ready.
Thank you.
<i>No smoking</i> <i>inside the building.</i>
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where am I, Zeb?
There I am.
Again?
Where am I?
Where am I?
There I am.
There I am.
Where am I?
Where am I, Zeb?
Mummy doesn't know.
This was yours. You're too big for that now.
It's still beautiful.
Right.
I like your style.
Hello?
Oh, my...
Hello.
I don't understand!
Apparently, behavioral patterns are highly erratic.
of her own skin, could be an allergic reaction to the tag.
Bacterial infection maybe?
and lactate to gauge levels on medium term consequences.
She's going into convulsions!
I have pulses and electrical activity in the systemic heart!
What do you need?
We have to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
100 micrograms epinephrine!
Prep one dose lidocaine,
one magnesium chloride in case we have to remove the tag!
The stuff from Eden Zoo had to be destroyed.
100 micrograms now!
Here!
Five!
10 seconds!
15! No response!
20 seconds! Still no response!
I think we lost her!
Counting down to one-half minute!
Ah!
No!
Welcome to a world of wonder.
home to one million different species of life.
that bring you face to face
with our planet's most exotic creatures.
So come, step into that world of wonder.
The vets did an ultrasound on our dolphin, Hannah,
last week and nothing came back abnormal.
with heart failure.
But I have never seen a dolphin's condition
Ugh.
Oh! Um...
Am I too early?
I can come back.
No. Hi, Joe. You're... You're fine.
What do you want me to do about disposal?
Oh.
We have to recycle her
Mm.
Me neither.
Hannah deserves better.
rolling her out?
instead of Hannah.
It's too bad.
Oh...
Hey, Ellen. I've got a morning feed.
What's up?
Daniel, I'm checking to make sure that
from our facility were destroyed.
Yeah, I handled it myself.
Our logistics firm moved all the doses
out of the veterinary wing.
Moved?
Do you hear me?
Anytime one of our team members is called out,
they must submit and execute a disposal form.
I mean, none of that product has expired.
There was an incident!
to the dosage
Burn it and use whatever you have on reserve.
But you need to call and confirm now.
No, it is confirmed.
that has no storage space at their facility.
of anything they pick up at our lab.
You're sure? Positive?
Yeah, yeah. It's all good.
Everything's taken care of.
No, and I appreciate that and we do not want that either.
Thank you for confirming, Daniel.
You are welcome. Bye-bye.
I gotta go.
Hey, good morning!
I'm one of the senior aquarists here.
with some of the best the park has to offer.
Hey, man, this is pretty cool.
But, hey, it's my birthday,
Hey, this is for you.
Got a couple of t-shirts in there, some aquarium swag,
a birthday gift from your friends here
at the Shining Sea Aquarium.
Thank you.
I also have some fish here that our sharks like to eat,
a little bonito, some cod, some mackerel...
Hey, a little broth, some garlic and tomatoes,
Oh, it is now.
let alone a hot cooked meal.
Well, you're in luck. You don't have to cook this.
So do I.
Now in this tank is one of the fastest
We work on a tunnel system here.
So they have to swim through that portal in order to feed.
Ooh!
Hey, they're pretty quick.
Oh, yeah. They are amazing.
They have 12 serrated teeth on the upper jaw, 11 on the lower.
You definitely don't want these bad boys taken up in a tornado.
Why would a shark be in a tornado?
You know... 'cause of the...
Yeah, never mind. It's a boomer joke.
But I'm a fan favorite of the walrus.
You know, they're like gentle giants, you know?
Like those tusks? Man!
No, no, no. They're never in the same habitat.
Huh.
The tusks of a walrus and the serrated teeth of a Maco...
I think you'd lose that bet.
Dan here on that VIP feed like I told you.
I've been here a while. You gotta trust me.
It's just... I want this Senator Blackburn
Get back to work, Daniel.
She's got a thing for me.
Mm-hmm.
I don't want to spend all day in here with her,
Mm-hm.
He wants to know if you're planning on running for Governor
after your tenure in the State Senate comes to an end.
Well, aren't you?
Yes.
My poll numbers are through the roof.
at the Picayune-Herald an exclusive.
All right, what else?
Uh, tomorrow, meeting with the historic landmarks board.
There's no reason that a barn built in 1903
for 32 families.
All right.
- Good morning. - Right on time, as usual.
We can't afford to fall behind.
And we're gonna come up with solutions today, okay?
We have a lot to talk about.
Oh!
Hello? Hello?
Come in?
I need you both to the veterinary wing now!
Come in! This is Dr. James!
Come in!
Come in...
No... No. No!
<i>Come in! Come in! Clu? Miranda?</i>
Christie, meet me at the Veterinary.
I'm on it.
<i>I'll be down in a second.</i>
Oh, right.
I mean, our connection network is so antiquated,
we could put the components on display
Look, we need a new heating and cooling system
for all of the enclosures,
Our animal safety mechanisms are so inadequate
because we don't even have a high-speed network connection.
What about an online store?
There you go. That'll generate some revenue.
Write that down.
Great. Get me the funding.
that we can bring in new sponsors and donors.
You might be the CEO and president of this facility,
And you're very much appreciated for it.
we do for this facility,
of the fiscal year, okay?
Doing great here.
Every penny that goes into this facility
Wow.
You're saying this was an octopus?
Slow down, slow down.
Okay.
What happened, Dr. James?
We must close the duct before it gets out!
And there's no telling the level of toxic bacteria
Gotcha.
Okay, we gotta move fast.
Unfortunately, every vent has to be shut down manually
Yeah.
Miranda.
Do you hear me, Miranda?
Miranda, do you copy?
Christie? Christie, come in!
<i>Hey Clu, go for Christie.</i>
possibly inside of the ducts.
It killed two of our vet techs.
Copy?
Copy that.
So, for example, on Tuesdays and Fridays,
we have started doing a VIP Experience
If we started to do more of this, then maybe we could...
Karen?
Karen, what's wrong? What happened?
Sorry about this, Hannah.
I know Miranda's devastated...
And, uh...
Dr. James, what happened?
It killed them and it almost killed me...
- What? - Wait.
Who is dead? What is she talking about?
The octopus.
We brought it in for a tagging blend.
It went into cardiac arrest.
and now it's crawled into the duct.
Okay, we are officially closing for the day
and we're going on the lockdown.
Clu, can you come in? Copy.
We're in the main concourse.
This animal has become reanimated.
Did you... did you say reanimated?
Oh, come on! That is impossible.
Okay...
Tell me what happened.
What... was that?
That is extreme pacing behavior
and they're doing it at the same time.
Miranda! Come in! Miranda!
What's going on?
That's water.
One of the tanks has been compromised.
I'm not getting trapped in here!
I'll get on the boat and get help!
Christie!
Christie... Christie, wait!
Oh, my purse!
Just leave it!
Christie, if you can hear me, radio back when you reach help.
Oh my God.
Hey, what's going on? This normal?
Could be a variety of things. Hang on a second.
Like what?
Miranda, Daniel. Come in.
I think there's a fire at the Shining Sea Aquarium!
We gotta go through the other way.
Why isn't the door opening?
We are on lockdown.
There's no fire or anything.
until the lockdown is over.
So chill out. Follow the leader.
We're already here.
You lost my phone?
I had everything in there, mine and yours.
Miranda!
No.
Dr. James?
I left mine charging in my office
The alarm is going. Help is on the way!
Will this thing every turn off?
Yeah, it'll turn off in a second.
Okay.
So, basically, each quadrant works independently.
When there's a fire, they all shut
Would you stop!
Please, just stay calm.
Don't be sorry. Just stay calm.
We'll be out of here soon. Just relax.
Just as long as we can get the failsafe protocols released.
is through cellphones.
And if the surveillance systems are down,
we're pretty much moving blind through this place.
Brother, come on, man.
down a black slope with a busted boot.
Come on, man! Marry the girl!
This is 19. Copy that.
You got it. Copy that.
Miranda?
Miranda, come in.
Miranda, I think the octopus was here.
It might be on the move.
Copy, Clu. Be careful.
Okay, I'm gonna check in to see if the coast is clear.
It's clear. Come on, let's go. Hurry, hurry.
Okay.
Come on.
Give me something. Come on.
Hello?
<i>Hello?</i>
Is anybody there?
Don't touch the fence! It's electrified!
What?
No!
What was that, man?
Something is up with the animals.
What you trying to do?
I thought I could turn off the fence.
Like we can get a ladder or something!
Inside.
Bolted to the ground!
We're smarter than the fish! We got hands!
All right, number one, dude, that is speciest.
Two, otters are mammals.
There's just fish tanks, there's no mammals.
Okay, but what about them sharks?
I remember how fast they were!
I think we'll be fine.
Yeah, but they got teeth, remember?
Yes, behind two feet of transparent acrylic!
Okay.
Okay, with offices.
Good. You need a candy bar. You're a little hangry.
Sorry. Just a little stressed.
Okay, everything is locked down,
but I don't think she's going get us out in time.
Okay, everyone just stay quiet and stay behind me.
What? What's that?
Sounds like crocodiles.
Just stay quiet and follow.
I knew it!
Get down.
Okay, I think it's gone. Let's move.
Okay.
Run!
Oh, Jesus, go!
I don't see any smoke.
It's a fire until we find out it's not.
It's also locked.
I thought this place was open.
Dispatch, this is 19. We're on the property.
Not seeing anyone on site
Caller didn't cancel? Over.
<i>Negative. No cancel.</i>
Copy.
In the meantime, can you get us information
on maybe head of security or someone on site?
Copy that. Be careful.
Let's check it out.
It's the main switchboard.
Hours of Operation.
They're not open 'til 11 a.m.
I think we need to find some armor or something.
Armor?
Yes!
What are you gonna do?
What we need is this.
What about me? I need one!
It's Pirate's Bay!
Okay. Now a pirate fish gonna come attack me now?
Relax. It's a kid's area.
No. That was last season.
It won't open!
Whatever we can!
You're the one with the ax!
Oh, damn.
Ah!
What do I do? Oh! Ah!
Oh, God, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Whack it! Don't crack it!
Ah!
Woo! Take that, bitch!
Oh, God!
Where's the first aid kit?
Oh! Oh!
Ah!
Ah!
Should have got that armor when I had the chance!
You're fixing my face!
I think it's gone.
I'll go first.
That won't work.
Why? It worked for the fish.
There are 100 species of wildlife
through hundreds of thousands of gallons of water.
It's reinforced with Lucite
it's engineered not to break.
Well, the fish figured it out,
It won't work.
what's behind them before they're open.
Oh, God.
Crush them! That's the only way to stop them!
Ah! Help!
Ah! Help me!
Help, help me! Help!
Ow!
Quick! Back in the theater!
God Damn it!
Everyone get back!
Starfish!
Oh, God, okay. Karen, Karen, just stop!
Stop!
You have to crush their radial nerve
That is crazy.
That kind of starfish isn't supposed
Water pumps through its body, not blood.
to get here on time to save your life!
They're mostly non-toxic,
except for the blue-ringed, which is lethal.
Is that a blue-ringed one?
No.
Dr. Hyde was bitten and died from acute paralysis,
is also making their secretions more potent.
They're dead.
But not dead.
Huh?
must have been spread across the aquarium like a virus.
But Clu is trying to get us out of here, right?
Yeah, but after the last three times,
We could try the roof.
There is a door... There's an access door there.
Yeah. Yeah, we go where there's no water, right?
We go to the roof and we call for help.
And maybe somebody from the street will see us.
Maybe, yeah.
I'm pretty sure it's locked.
No, no. I come down here all the time.
It just needs a little elbow grease.
You sure about that?
Dude, I work out all the time.
Okay, He-man.
Hey, what's that over there?
Dude, so uncalled for.
Yeah.
Dude, I think you are getting a refund.
No, no. It's like a bunker.
Great. We can stay down here, right?
Ah...
I'm still not seeing anything.
Maybe the phones are down in there.
Dispatch just sent me a number for
Cluwirth.
I'll give her a call.
Let's go. Let's go check it out.
Clu?
Clu, talk to me.
Miranda, I'm here.
<i>Are you okay?</i>
You're not hurt, are you?
It's bad.
is covered with grease or slime, I guess.
I think the octopus left it here.
There's something happening to the animals.
Listen, Clu, we're in the Theater Box Office.
At the moment, no, I don't.
But at the time, I have no operational capability.
A half hour?
Would somebody please tell me why this desk
That console monitors all of the security
and all of the surveillance on the entire property
Wonderful.
What about getting out from there?
Uh, no go.
Now those doors aren't designed
to keep out flooding, only fires.
going to keep on moving until it's safely to do so.
- Copy? - Copy that.
<i>Be careful out there.</i>
- Marvelous. - We'll keep moving
and check back with you later.
Gotcha.
Oh, yeah.
This scar's gonna get me laid.
Man, this place is rank.
Yeah.
So why a nurse?
Why not doctor, you know, make the cash?
Really?
Middle-aged?
Besides, management just isn't for me.
Plans, huh? Really?
Aw, damn!
Not those spider crabs again!
Okay, okay. I think we need to move up into the aquarium.
The aquarium, not the fish tanks.
What's the difference?
Okay, get your phone out.
Look, I know! I was making a joke!
This is gonna lead us to the aquarium.
With the sharks?
They're in tanks!
Will you hold still?
Go, go.
Okay, look.
and there's a staircase, all right?
So we're just gonna move to this real fast.
and we're gonna be in the aquarium.
Yes, that are in tanks.
Okay?
After you.
Shh!
Let's just go, let's just go, let's go, go, go, go, go.
You are freaking me out, buddy!
Just keep it together!
What you scared for? You got the ax!
Will you please?
I'm behind you with nothing!
There.
And be smart out there, too.
Copy that.
This starfish has cutaneous abrasions
and tissue decay consistent with the onset
of marine epizootic similar to SSWS.
Well, I haven't noticed any limb impairment
or limited mobility.
But I'm not ruling out bacterial contamination.
Yeah.
Jesus!
You crushed its nervous system!
Dead, but not dead.
What?
Hey, Clu? Clu?
<i>And do not touch any of the slime.</i>
No. No way am I touching that slime.
And I'm not going anywhere. We need to find a way out.
<i>We've never seen anything like this</i>
and it could be contagious.
And we really don't know what's causing it.
I'm gonna try to get these cameras up and running
<i>I don't like you all running around blindly</i>
<i>without knowing what's around the corner.</i>
<i>Especially because we're not exactly sure</i>
<i>what we're up against.</i>
Thank you, Clu. We'll keep moving.
I'll check back with you later.
Copy that.
Let's see what we got.
Come on. Give me something!
Okay, I'm gonna get you guys out of here,
but I need to find a map.
Come help me find one.
Yes...
No.
Oh, I found some!
Yes, I just need to...
Oh... oh, yeah.
What are you smiling at?
Oh, I don't feel so good.
Hey! Focus!
I really feel like I'm gonna pass out.
Hey, you lost a lot of blood, man.
Oh...
Hey, I'll be right back.
Okay.
Where'd he go?
Hey. Here. You gotta drink this.
You... You saved my life back there.
Hey, hey.
You're a tour guide.
Hey, I just remembered!
What?
Seriously? Is that one locked, too?
You wanna show me?
Jacked up my knee.
You're a tough guy. You can shake it off.
Ah!
For what?
I'm still the tour guide.
Yeah, Dispatch. No hot spots, no people.
Place is empty.
There's another outage at the aquarium.
Something's gotta be going on.
10-4. Copy that.
Shh!
That's a crocodile!
Negative! No!
We have a citywide grid outage.
- How long? - 60 minutes.
We've gotta find a way in there!
You should have gotten a girlfriend.
Well, maybe I thought the tour guide was gonna be a girl.
What was that?
Ah!
Okay, so the sea lion habitat is both indoor and outdoor.
It's about 15 feet.
Well, the only problem is that sea lion habitat
is in Quadrant One.
and the fire doors are shut very tight.
So if we can figure out a way to get through the quadrant,
we can get out.
That's the plan.
But we can't let any of these animals get out to the public.
and destruction that would occur as a result.
We can wedge it from the outside.
and it's probably still on the move in the ducts.
Wait.
We never had a chance to bring it online.
But I could log on to the network and initiate the signal.
Okay, yes.
Everything else is down.
Okay.
So we'll go get your phone.
is because of our backup generators.
But who knows how long that will last.
Okay?
That's the plan.
Okay?
Now what?
Well, we have two options.
We can either go this way or that way.
And that way is flooded, so...
So that's not an option, so we're going this way.
Great.
I have an idea.
This is the Educational Lab.
It's been under construction for a few weeks.
There's been flooding in here, too.
No.
It's the only way we'll get to the sea lion habitat.
Okay. There you go.
Thank you.
And then Dr. James and I will follow behind you.
Okay.
The Marine Science Gallery, it's got a different color carpet.
And then just drop down in there.
Okay.
Different color carpet. Got it.
Uh, I don't know about this...
Okay, well, unfortunately,
Mm-hm.
Just give me your hand.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Oh, no, no. I have this.
Okay.
Okay, Karen, let's go.
Okay.
I cannot believe you lost our phones!
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.
Oh, God. Oh, I want to get down.
I really... Okay, I've got to get down.
Beth, it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Where's Dr. James?
She took a different route. She's gonna meet us there.
What?
She's gonna meet us there!
Oh, my God.
Just keep going.
Okay.
This is insane.
I cancelled a 12 PM lunch for this.
Actually sir, they had already cancelled last week.
giving back to the community.
We do appreciate your support.
Okay, come on.
It's safe down here. I went.
Oh! Okay.
Okay, is anything down there?
Take this. Stand right here.
Careful.
Got it?
I guess you got it.
All right. This way.
What is that?
Oh!
- Sorry. - Crabs!
You're alive!
Ah!
Uh, we're not far from the Veterinary.
I can go get my phone.
I'll go with you.
Wait, wait, wait! Be careful!
Oh my God!
Joe!
No. He's gone.
Oh my God.
This is just like the syringe I used on the octopus!
Oh, my God, E.Z.
Eden Zoo!
I thought that was destroyed.
Daniel told me he burned them.
That theory is totally wacked, Miranda.
There has to be a normal, logical,
Then why did Dr. Rogers tell us to get rid of the injectors?
Bad lots happen all the time.
And I told you I got rid of them.
I don't know. Maybe Logistics screwed up
and one of them mixed in with the stable lot.
to register the telemetry tag on the octopus.
It may be this fiberglass insulation.
So how do you explain these syringes?
I don't know, Miranda.
No.
So if you want to talk to me about anything that you know,
you tell me right now.
I'm telling you I don't know anything.
This is an aquarium!
Hundreds of thousands.
Forget that! Come on! Let's take the stairs!
Hey! I got it!
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, shit!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, my God!
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Next time, I'm taking the stairs.
Almost there...
What in the hell were you thinking?
Rigging that tank to break
What's gotten into you?
It wasn't me!
I only lied about burning the bad doses
I'm not an idiot!
Uh, Daniel.
Oh, my God.
Okay, we can just turn back and...
Now what?
Yeah, but it's different.
It's new, it's louder and more urgent.
It's like they can't see each other,
like they're blind or something.
No. Not today, not today! I'm not dying today!
Skylar, no!
Ah!
Ooh, look at all this!
Miranda?
Come back. Checking in.
How's everyone doing out there?
Miranda? Come in!
Miranda!
Everyone, stay completely quiet.
Oh, God. That was close.
Everybody, quick. Hide!
Stay out of its path and stay quiet.
What are you gonna do, Karen?
Just shut up and go. Everybody go. Go.
No, Karen! No!
Come on, work! Record!
with one another.
on locating its prey through sound!
<i>...blindness... eyes milky white.</i>
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent with total loss of vision</i>
<i>through form of improvised communication with one another.</i>
<i>upon locating their prey through sound!"</i>
<i>...of complete blindness, eyes milky white.</i>
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent with total loss of vision</i>
<i>through form of imp...</i>
A door.
Come on, come on, come on!
Damn it!
Miranda? You there?
Go ahead, Clu.
The desk is back online.
So it's a good news and bad news situation.
What news do you want first?
I think we could all use a little good news right now.
Okay, good news it is.
And the bad?
And the bad news is
the failsafe locking mechanisms are electronic
and absolutely none of them are responding.
So nothing or no one is getting out of here
Copy.
How is she working on the console
if this whole place is out of power?
Because the console has a backup battery.
It was the last thing to get upgraded six years ago.
I've tried to reroute the power to the alternate generator.
It needs to be switched on manually?
Hey, Clu. We're in the sea lion habitat.
Copy.
The basement?
get from the fire door to here?
Let's get there.
Okay.
Why?
Because all the doors are still locked! Jesus!
So wait, wait.
What exhibit are we talking about?
Shark Cove.
You gotta be kidding.
- Oh, shit. - Everyone hide!
It's clear.
Let's go.
Come on.
Whoa!
Shh!
Okay, these... These are Macos.
Where are the others?
Hey, Miranda, there's the stairwell
Maybe we go back that way.
Fuck this.
And then I'm having this place condemned!
No, you can't just do that.
You can't just march over there
Okay, we should go one by one, okay?
Okay, I'll go first.
Make sure it's safe.
Okay.
Ooh!
Okay.
Oh.
Okay, come on, guys. Come on, guys.
I'm feeling really, really cold.
Feels like you're burning up.
Watch me do it.
Oh my... oh!
Okay, good job.
Okay, come on back, come on.
No.
You gotta go. But you gotta go now.
- I can't. - Yes, you can.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Follow the leader.
Okay, one more.
One more to go.
Okay, come on, Karen.
Your turn.
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.
Okay, okay.
Yes, yes, okay!
Oh, my God!
Just one more. Just one more.
Behind you!
Watch out!
Ah!
- Move! - Jesus!
Help me!
Give me your tie! Give me your tie!
There you go. Can you walk?
I'm not gonna let you leave me behind, that's for damn sure.
Okay, good.
Whoa! Whoa!
You okay?
Yeah, thank you.
I'm so cold, I'm so cold.
Oh, my gosh, she's burning up.
Are you okay?
Can you help me?
Oh, my God!
Okay, thank you.
Oh, my God, it's drinking her blood source.
Ow!
Look at me.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's in there so deep!
Guys?
Guys, I don't think she's breathing.
No.
Beth, no! I can get this off!
Miranda, we lost her.
No, no, no, no, no, no, Beth.
No, no, no, no!
I can do this!
Miranda, she's gone.
There was no saving her at this point.
even with the central nervous system destroyed.
Who knows how long that thing's been stuck there?
Did you know about this?
No. She didn't say anything.
We gotta keep moving. Let's go!
No, no!
Jack, you don't understand! This thing was at least 15 feet!
That's why we call you guys in!
at Eden zoo right now.
We can't get in. It's electrified.
What'd he say?
What?
Something about the Eden Zoo Sanctuary.
Call the Sheriff's Department!
Let's go!
Where's the breaker box?
We're never gonna get out of here.
You're gonna what?
Be careful.
Almost there...
Careful!
No! No!
Oh!
Get off me!
Clu!
Deep-fried calamari... my favorite.
Ah!
No! Clu!
No, Clu!
Clu!
You gotta keep going, Miranda!
You can do this!
That's right.
Almost there.
Yes!
I can't get to the breakers from here.
But I can get to the generator!
What?
I'm gonna go this way to the generator!
Stay right there!
Where is this thing?
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, God!
Oh, God... oh!
Ah!
No, I'm fine.
Not you, Daniel.
What?
The disposal order from the Eden Zoo supply?
You told me that we could get that from your office.
Miranda?
We've just been through hell and back, all right?
You need to give me a day to clean up my wounds.
No.
Let's make one thing clear.
You show me that disposal order
or you tell me what really happened.
I'm waiting.
Fine. All right.
It's Blackburn.
It's all his idea.
to switch them, he was gonna cut me in.
I didn't know this was gonna happen!
Why did you think was gonna happen?
There are innocent people dead because of you!
Okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy now!
Okay.
That'll do it.
Not cool!
Come on, buddy.
Thank you!

They blocked all the entrances, and no one told me what was happening.
Please answer me!
Yes, it's very strange, even though it's already two o'clock in the afternoon.
Be careful, people are so panicked, it scares me.

Hello? Yes! Hello!
Hello, who's talking?
Banish.
Banish? What is that?
Nickname. Not important.
Tell me, where did you get this frequency?
I tried it.
Written on the wall. Okay.
Yes.
Give me an honest answer.
Anyone following you? Are you going alone?
this is not for fun.
I stay on this frequency.
Where exactly did you find it?
But it's been looted.
Yes, I know which building you mean. I was nearby.
Did you find anything?
You don't have a knife or something else you can use?
I really want a steak sandwich.
Stop, this is torture! I could eat a dog now.
What's your name? Where are you now?
I'm in a building.
What does it sound like?
I've been where you are. But the situation is very bad.
Dangerous, better wait.
Where are you now?
Demian?
Demian?
I'll tell you where exactly, but please, drop everything and come here.
Don't do it if you're not sure.
Hi! Are you there? Answer.
Hello, what happened?
Sorry, I have to maintain radio silence,
I heard voices and had to move.
Where are you now?
I'm heading your way.
Yes, I'm still here.
Okay.
No, mate, that's a luxury. Why do you ask that?
Well, I have a car.
Is it true?
Sorry about the battery.
I don't care.
I understand.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Give it back to me!
Hello Bannen, can you hear me?
Hello Demian!
Where are you?
I still need time, I have to take
a detour, a lot of movement.
Yes, me...
I'm so scared!
Bloodsucker? Damn.
Listen, don't believe their voice.
Yes I know.
Now I'm in a greenhouse.
Two blocks, more or less,
far from the road.
Yes, that's great, mate.
This is getting complicated. Keep your head down, okay?
I will pass this creature.
Demian?
Yes I'm here.
I tried, but I couldn't.
I don't know.
Have you prepared the weapon?
Listen, there's usually a button next to the handle.
Can take out the bullet magazine.
Check the cartridge.
There's a button here.
Now pull, like in the movies.
Done.
Now I understand.
You're Charles Bronson.
When I was little,
I love camping in their park.
That's another life, my friend.
Yes.
Time passes quickly.
And suddenly you wake up and see everything
Yes, what is that?
I find his voice very calming.
No, no, you're crazy.
You don't know me.
No, I just heard it.
But you have to do something, right?
Yes, they definitely do.
Oh okay.
You're an asshole.
Listen, let's get some quiet for now.
Understand. Understand.
I don't want to interfere, and I won't interfere.
But why do you always fight?
With all the love you have for each other.
And you, you know him.
Let's not argue anymore, okay?
Banish, do you hear me?
Now seems like a good time for you to move on.
This situation confuses you even more.
Drop it!
Drop it!
Give me your weapon!
I've dropped.
The backpack.
This only I have.
Come on!
Come on!
Fuck!
Bastard!
Fuck!
You shot me, you bastard!
Come on, you have to help me!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Wait! You can't leave me like this!
Please help me!
Do not leave me!
Help!
Please stop!
Who are you? Hah?
Jesus?
Isaiah.
Is that you, kid?
I'm worried about you.
You left without warning.
- Forgive me. - It's okay, nothing happened, right.
Good.
Good? Just that?
Yes.
Good. Now you're here.
Sorry, dad.
It doesn't matter.
Come on, eat.
It's still warm.
You're hungry!
They don't give you anything.
Drink it.
What a night you chose to come.
Just look at the sky.
You're right, my son.
They are as hungry as we are.
How did you pray when you were little?
You scream, "They're coming, they're coming!"
You used to live in luxury and now you're crawling on the ground.
but out of necessity.
Previously we didn't know how to find ourselves.
The sky is falling because of us now.
Do you think we'll need you?
We live in Eden! They took him!

- What is the point? - This makes me happy!
Your sister knows.
That's why he left.
He goes with them.
And now I'm a grandfather!
Singer grandfather from heaven.
What's his name?
Your daughter.
I will take you.
Demian!
Demian, are you there?
Yes I'm here. What is it?
Hear. I'm in one place.
A workshop, I don't know.
I found the battery.
I've tried it.
Still have some burdens.
Don't rely too much on it.
But hey, what do you have to lose?
There isn't any.
Where are you now?
Are you close?
I'm very close to the warehouse.
But I'll go the other way.
We can meet in the car.
Okay.
Go to the south side.
There's a back door there.
Go out, then go right, there is a dark alley.
Then go straight for 50 meters.
There you will find the car.
Banish. That's you, isn't it?
The acid is leaking.
This won't work.
Sorry friend.
There is a way out.
This won't be easy.
If you're ready, let's go now.
From here, straight forward.
500 meters.
Go straight towards the forest.
Go.
I'll take the other tunnel. This is my way of distracting you.
See you at the exit.
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Have you ever eaten this?
No.
You're really funny.
Maybe we'll catch one and cook it.
Wait a minute, I want to pee.
Let's go, buddy. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Why are you called Banen?
It's a nickname, you say.
When I was little I often read science fiction comics.
There's a character named Brian Bannen.
My father always called me Bannen.
And you make it a habit?
I always feel like I'm someone else.
And who are you?
But this one has something special.
Do you know which one?
He wants to be human.
He talked about almost all the animals.
Alligators, tapirs, birds.
Everyone looked at him as if he was crazy.
That's not possible.
He said, "I can help you."
"Where does he live?"
"Good, good!"
The witch's name, Aivaguá.
He is cooking something.
Aivaguá looked at him.
"I want to be human."
"Will it work?" he asked.
"Your feet!"
"Your fur!"
"No! No! No! I won't give you my feathers! Not my beautiful feathers!"
Finally Aivaguá got tired and said:
but I can't give you what you ask for!
"I can't!"
just for convenience, then I'm very sorry.
I ask you never to ask for my help again.
And something else:
You will continue to dream of being human.
"And this is how you die."
"And this is how you die."
And you?
Have you sacrificed much?
This is strange.
I have memories, but...
I know I've never lived it.
Could I see it?
Victor.

There is nothing left.
I hope.
You are okay.
You find peace.
I apologize.
I have to get you out of there.
You.
You...
You're a parasite.
How about you?
Who are you?
I have this place.
I went out to plant seeds.
And you?
Do you know who you are?
I always know who I am!
I accept it!
May I ask for your help?
What?
Will you give me one?

-Say it again. Come on. -[pilot wheezing]
[Numa] The night hits like an ambush.
[Numa] We huddle together the best we can.
Grab my hand tighter.
[Numa] That's how we spend the night.
[crying] Mommy!
Tighter, Pancho.
[shakily] Help me. Help me.
[spluttering] Help.
[shivering] Help!
We're still alive, Pancho. [laughs]
You got another one?
No, not yet.
Marcelo. We lost three more. Pancho Abal and Martínez Lamas.
And the lady who was screaming.
Nando may not make it.
His sister's really weak.
Let's take out the seats so we can all fit in there.
C'mon, guys. C'mon.
So let's clean up this side of the plane. That's where the sun is.
We'll take anyone who's hurt over there and help them as much as we can.
-[Marcelo] Platero! -Yeah?
Anything you find that might be useful, put in a suitcase. Okay?
[man] Bobby. Bobby.
What do we do with the dead?
DANTE LAGURARA - AGE 41
[Marcelo] Here, take one, okay?
We gotta make it last.
Hey!
Hey!
Help!
-Help! -[man] Hey!
DAY 2 OCTOBER 14, 1972
-[man 1] Wait. Stop. -[Carlitos] No. Isn't there a bigger one?
-That one there. Roy! -[man 2] No! Don't touch it.
[Carlitos] See if you can find rags, coats, clothes.
-[Carlitos] Look for fabric, clothes… -[Marcelo] Give me that one.
[Roy] Coco! Take this. It's bigger.
How many are gonna die tonight?
No one's gonna die, Carlitos.
I promise.
Here, cover all those holes so that the cold doesn't get in at night.
[quietly] Marcelo.
They're coming.
Tomorrow.
[Numa] Fito Strauch isn't as optimistic as Marcelo.
He's a reasonable man.
He would never go against the captain.
But he doesn't like what he sees.
This is a place where life is impossible.
DAY 3 OCTOBER 15, 1972
No. No. Uh, Nando… Don't.
[grunts] Shit.
What happened?
Plane crashed.
[Nando] My sister?
I got it.
-[Nando] How long have we been here? -Three days.
They seen us?
[Marcelo] Give me that. Okay. Thanks.
Hey!
-[man] Over here! -Whoo-hoo!
A full-stuffed Canadian chivito?
[inhales] A milanesa from La Mascota.
-[man 1] Oh yeah. That'd be great. -Oh. Fries on the side.
-I love their milanesas. So good. -They're the best.
They could've dropped some food from the plane, right?
[sighs] Well, that wouldn't make sense.
If they drop a package like that, it'd sink in the snow.
[Roberto] Bring in the injured.
Careful with his legs. Right there.
We saw them fly over.
They're coming.
-We need to have faith. -Faith? What faith?
If you tell them, you'll destroy their morale.
They will rescue us.
[Roberto] Three minutes without air,
Roque told us about the batteries.
In my opinion, we should go up there, where the plane crashed,
and get the radio working.
We gotta keep going!
The snow is still firm!
-[exhales] -[Roberto] I don't want to carry you back.
[Carlitos] Fito.
What happened?
You can't see the plane.
They won't find it, even if they fly over us.
[Numa] It's been six days without food.
A pack of crackers.
[quietly] Carlitos came over to tell me something.
He says that Nando's losing his mind.
I'm not gonna starve to death.
[Fito] That he'd eat the bodies if he had to.
If I have to, I'll eat the bodies.
If we wanna get rescued, we gotta stay alive.
And to stay alive, we need to eat.
Marcelo.
We're dying.
Are you crazy, Roberto?
You gonna make everyone else crazy too?
Roberto!
Can't we wait a couple more days?
-Know what happens when you stop eating? -Roberto!
The body dries out. Just like plants.
You can't use your brain. Because it dries out too, Marcelo.
If we do it…
God put us in this situation. He'll understand we need to survive.
I'm sorry, Marcelo.
It's luck that brought us here.
And who would even do it?
[quietly] I'll do it.
We can't just take, defile, and desecrate someone's body without consent.
Susy?
Susy. Susy, breathe.
No, no, no. Susana.
Susana, come on. No. No. Gustavo!
[Nando] Roberto. She's not breathing, Roberto.
-Help her. -[Roberto] Bring her here. Right there.
Help me, Gustavo! Hurry!
-[Gustavo] She's not breathing. -[Roberto] Susy!
[Numa] "Dear Mom and Dad,
"We're in a beautiful place,
"We're all doing fine."
"As of now, there are 27 survivors."
"Nando Parrado's sister passed away today."
"I miss you very much."
[Numa] "And I'm constantly praying to God,
that he at least lets me see you one last time."
This is a cemetery.
And I'm not staying here.
[man] It hurts! My stomach hurts!
[woman] I know, Moncho. You need to calm down.
-Just breathe. -I can't breathe. [sobs]
Look at me, Moncho. Look at me. Breathe.
-I don't want to! -Just breathe.
[Moncho] I gotta get outta here! I'm suffocating!
I give you my consent as well.
You also have my permission.
[Moncho] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses
On earth as it is in heaven.
-[gasps] -[Moncho] And lead us not into temptation.
I'm sorry. [sniffles]
[Roque] Sorry, Marcelo.
[shivering] Don't give me that look, Coche.
I'm not giving you a look.
Fito chooses the bodies.
And they cut them up in secret.
Away from everyone else.
[Roy] A radio!
It's all wet.
Come on, Roy. Fix it.
Waiting for a sign.
[Coco] Left or right?
Higher, Coco.
and tie it to a pole or something.
A bit more.
Less. A little to the right.
Take this.
What is that?
You have to eat, Numa.
It's not right, Pancho.
Why?! [screams]
...have arrested redevelopment officials,
Mr. Kim and Mr. Choi, for murder.
But the police investigation is hindered
According to the forensics team,
two tracks escaped from the scene.
so we believe he was either passive
or injured in the course of the crime.
The Goblin.

A few years ago,
That man was the Goblin.
So what?
Right.
So what?
Right.
to dig out who it is,

I almost pissed my pants too.
But you know me!

Are you laughing at me?
You think I am funny, don't you?

Do as I say!
But when I am with him,

You never once think about how I feel.
Yeah.
10 years is enough to change nature.
He must have a reason for approaching Eun-joo.
We must strike first.
Sir!
Was it when Ye-na was five?
The other kids were with their mom and dad.
Ye-na suddenly grabbed my hand,
pretending that nothing was wrong,
since she had enough fun.
No matter what happens,
I won't.
I promise.

- So, weed? - Yeah.
Five grams, 70 bucks.
Seventy? No way. Forty.
Fifty minimum. It's from California.
- Forty. That's all I have. - Fuck's sake.
I've also got coke, pills, MDMA, and LSD.
Poppers? Your sister might be into that.
Just weed.
Check out this chain. 18 karats.
Forty euros.
You've got money. I can tell.
- I'm just trying to make a living. - Sure. Yeah.
Police!
POLICE
Screw you, you bastard!
Are you okay?
The cops arrested a guy.
Dan, we need to talk to Reno.
It could've been you or me.
Dan.
The police came to get this guy.
If I hadn't stopped him, he would have killed her.
- No answer. - Try again.
<i>Yeah?</i>
Reno.
<i>Dan? Holy shit.</i>
<i>I've been calling you nonstop. Are you okay?</i>
<i>Okay. I'm here.</i>
<i>Dan, listen. Those assholes wanted to pin the whole thing on me.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, bro.</i>
- We skipped town. <i>- Are you with Vio?</i>
Hi, Reno.
<i>Vio! Away for your honeymoon?</i>
No. A bachelor party.
- How are you doing? <i>- Meh.</i>
<i>I'm holding up. Francesca left me for another guy.</i>
How are things there?
<i>But you guys are in deep shit 'cause you hit that cop.</i>
<i>No, I haven't. Sorry, Vio.</i>
<i>your dad's back in jail. I thought you should know.</i>
<i>The cops went looking for you and found some shit in the house.</i>
<i>It isn't the same around here without you. I miss you.</i>
<i>What's your plan?</i>
Yeah, blondie.
Yeah!
Where'd you sell it?
Wasn't he pissed?
- He slapped me in the face. - Wait, what?
Yeah. The dude went apeshit.
Didn't your sister talk to him?
Yeah, no.
She never says anything.
Since our mom died, we've just drifted apart.
I know she loves me.
What do you spy?
- No way, Vio! - What's wrong?
No! Dan! Put me down!
Don't you dare!
Happy to see me, huh? Wow.
Thanks.
Want tequila?
Dan?
You saw yourself in there, didn't you?
You almost killed him, Dan.
- Not again. - I'm sorry.
There's something inside me I can't…
I just…
Dan, listen.
because we've done something stupid.
I'll try to call her tomorrow.
What about you?
What do you want?
Dan, what do you want?
What about Berlin?
Dan, you can't give up.
You're so talented.
Remember that.
Fuck my life! Jesus Christ!
Oh my God!
Coming down?
Where'd you get this?
- I borrowed it. - Right.
Dan! Stop!
Hey, stop. Let me drive.
Hold on tight.
Come on.
Come with me.
Where?
Berlin.
What would I do there?
Didn't you want to start over? Well, I do too.
With the money we have, we can leave tomorrow.
You're not going back home.
So come with me.
I don't want to go without you.
Dan…
Tell your friend this is a hostel, not a brothel.
- Reno? - <i>Dan.</i>
<i>I got my face bashed in.</i>
What went down?
Who attacked you? Reno, calm down. What happened?
<i>It was your dad, Dan. He sent people.</i>
- You said my dad was back in jail. <i>- That's why he did it.</i>
We need to go. Grab your stuff. Hurry.
What's going on?
Come on.
Wait, Dan.
Dan.
Dan, stop.
- Dan! - He'll never leave me alone.
I'm here, okay? We're in this together.
We're all right.
Not now!
- Hey. Chill. - We gotta go, guys.
- Didn't you like the weed? - What's this?
Not now, okay?
- What's your problem? - Aren't we friends?
- Come on. - Why the rush?
- We don't want trouble. - Introduce us to her.
- Vio, let's go. - What's your name?
- Come on. - Shut it. We're talking to her.
Come on.
- Hey. Come with us. - I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Shut up. - Don't touch me. Are you deaf?
Watch your mouth!
Fucking quit it.
What now?
What now?
Let's go.
No! Let me go!
- Get off me! - Don't touch her!
Vio!
No.
Dan, look at me.
Dan, I'm going to Berlin with you.
I'm here, okay?
I'm with you.
Help!
Someone help me!
- I spy with my little eye… - No.
I spy with my little eye…
Help!
Wow. Thanks, Ahmed.
Vio, take this out to the terrace.
Hey.
The one outside.
We're going dancing.
Just the check, please.
Vio.
<i>When are you gonna teach me?</i>
<i>Scared I'll be better than you?</i>
Laboratory Module I and III samples
but the RNA polymerases lost their efficacy.
Many living subjects have died.
The bodies are now transported to the deep dumps for destruction.
Request to enter.
What is going on?
Dr. Q has conducted some gene coding and recombination.
But yielded a few results.
to be a complete failure.
How about No. 2 experimental body?
The body size grew tremendously.
It's completely out of control.
If we let it grow,
I am afraid the experiment will be exposed.
Even if it's just once.
I lost everything.
All these years of hard work
have gone to waste.
Delete all the experiment data immediately.
Goodbye,
my old friends.
Activate the second plan.
Got it.
Quick!
No one shall leave the lab alive.
All experiment staff has to die.
Roger.
You two.
Get this place cleaned up.
Yes, Boss.
Help!
Go now.
Be careful.
Be careful!
Go!
Come, take a photo of me.
What are you looking at?
The...
Seagull!
Come here.
Pervert.
She looks great indeed.
No, no!
Wait!
Wait!
Don't touch him.
You bastard!
Isn't this me?
Leader Qin?
Da Zhong?
When did you leave the rescue team?
Hey!
You are a young man with no martial virtue!
What you want?
Huh?
Come on!
Let's fight.
Chinese martial arts!
Ouch! Bro!
Ouch! Bro!
I am not ready yet!
to testify in court.
Wait.
I'm just a normal employee of the CASS Medical Group.
CASS Medical Group
You must know something.
CASS Medical Group is more terrifying than a poisonous snake.
You will not defeat them.
Bro, goodbye!
Dear passengers,
The cruise ship has just encountered an undercurrent that has caused a bumpy ride.
Please do not panic.
Hello.
I'm a journalist for Men's Travel Magazine.
I see that your muscle tone and body proportions
No!
You are the most perfect guy
for our image model in the entire cruise ship.
And we'll pay you.
Sorry.
I'm not interested.
Be a handsome man.
To make women's eyes lust.
What do you really do?
You've gone too far.
Ouch!
I'll say it.
I'll say it!
I know you are investigating the CASS Medical Group.
And you have already found the key evidence.
So I followed you.
The key evidence
has just run away.
Listen to me.
Let's investigate the CASS Medical Group together.
No way.
One of my predecessors died because of this.
So I must continue to investigate.
And I need your help.
don't get involved in this.
But I want to...
Help!
Snakes!
There are snakes!
Run!
Hurry!
Run!
Help! Help!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Come with me.

How can there be snakes in the ship?
Run!
Leave now!
Snakes!

Let's go!
Go, this way.
Quick, this way.
Leave!
I am scared, grandpa.
Grandpa...
Grandpa will protect you.
Okay.
Over here.
I noticed that this snake has no eyes.
This way.
Faster!
Come, be quick.
Are you alright?
Quick, leave now.
It's dangerous here.
We need to go find a heat source nearby.
Snakes!
Run now!
Go!
Quick, run!
Let's go!
Go, go, go!
Everybody stick close.
Time for beauty sleep.

How about that side?
Quick, run!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Go!
Everyone move closer together.
Maintain body temperature.
It's minus 25 degrees Celsius here.
Within five minutes
our bodies will lose heat.
If we continue like this,
Please trust me.
I have a plan.
I will
open this metal door later.
I will create noise
to attract the huge snake to come in.
Da Zhong.
You have to seize the opportunity
to escape from the other direction.
No, no way!
I don't agree to this arrangement.
I'll do it.
Let me do it.
Nonsense.
Maintain your temperature.
Hurry up.
Brother.
if I can live?
Trust me.
I will definitely get everyone out.
Sit down.
You can't go.
I will do it!
Let me go!
I'll do it!
Stay away!
Come back!
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
Run!
Come here!
Go!
Leave now!
Run!
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
We must go, Leader Qin!
Go away!
Let's go to the cockpit.
We don't know how to operate a ship.
I...
I can try.
Just follow me.
Let's go.
Keep up.
Come in.
Be careful.
Be careful!
What's going on?
Keep calm.
Think of it
Okay.
You can do it.
We are saved.
That's great!
Leader Qin.
Why did you leave the rescue team?
Who let you go through my bag?
I just didn't want to drag you and the others into it.
after all,
it's my private business.
Bullshit.
Do you have us in your heart?
Oh yeah, you're right.
You look very masculine.
Who knew you'd be so petty?
Really?
Steady the ship.
Hurry.
What's that thing?
Da Zhong.
Jason.
Come out with me.
Come on.
Let's go.
Run!
Hurry up!
Da Zhong.
Da Zhong,
get everyone out of here.
What about you?
I have my own plans.
You...
Help!
Help!
Come out. Be quick.
Feng Li.
It contains
I'm counting on you.
Go!
Go, go.
Hurry up.
Go now.
It's okay now.
Leader Qin!
Qin Yu!
Leader Qin!
Qin Yu!
Leader Qin!
Leader Qin!
Leader Qin!
Leader Qin!
Leader Qin!
Leader Qin!
Qin Yu!
Leader Qin!
Qin Yu!

Leader Qin!
That's great.
Qin Yu.
Are you alright?
Leader Qin.

Leader Qin.
Qin Yu.
Da Zhong.
Da Zhong.
Wake everyone up.
Get out of here, quick!
Let's leave.
Wake up, wake up.
Let's go ashore. Come on.
Give your hands to me.
Come on.
Be careful.
Be careful.
Slowly.
Something's not right here.
Let's go.
Are you alright?
No!
Jason!
Go now!
Run!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Run!
Why didn't that creature get me?
Why?
If I'm not mistaken,
these creatures are attracted to blood.
Let's leave immediately.
Be careful.
Come on, be careful.
Mind the steps.
Leader Qin.
is extraordinarily powerful.
Yes.
What happened here?
I found two grenades
and a double-barreled gun.
What's this?
This is radio equipment.
Any signal?
How about this.
Let's quickly
search for some more useful equipment.
Let's go find a high ground
Quick.
Where is Da Yong?
He went to look for water.
Let's hurry.
Qin Yu.
Let's give it a try.
I'm sorry for the trouble
I've caused you guys this time.
Let's go.
What's wrong?
Let's go, Yueyue.
Okay.
Run!
Yueyue, run quickly!
Okay.
Be careful.
I am scared, grandpa.
Yueyue!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Run!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
I want grandpa.
Come here, Yueyue.
Let's go.
Don't look. It's okay.
It's fine now.
Let's go.
Oh my god.
It's human beings
There is an entrance here.
Come quickly.
Let's go.
These documents were burnt.
The mutation on the island
is probably due to contamination from the experiments they were conducting.
When human beings pollute nature,
it is human beings themselves who ultimately get polluted.
Let's look carefully
and see what clues we can find.
There's a door here.
This group of people doing harm to society,
but leading an enjoyable life.
Bro.
No thanks.
Qin Yu.
There's edible beef jerky
Smells good.
Let's all
spend the night here tonight and rest.
We should eat and drink well,
and wait for rescue.
Old Fang.
You are a real man.
Come on.
Cheers!
Today...
She should have
been wearing a beautiful wedding dress
and the ring that I picked out for her myself.
She's like you.
She's a journalist.
She is your so-called predecessor.
the evidence of the CASS Medical Group's crimes
in the hope that
there will be no more victims.
she has lost her life on the job.
We're all sorry about her death.
We admire her very much.
She must still be looking over you.
That's why we've been able to live until now.
when a journalist is close to the truth,
it is the closest to death.
So,
Come on, heroine.
I apologize
for the way I treated you before.
I was impulsive.
I should apologize to you for that.
Let's take down the CASS Medical Group.
Then,
After going to court
Boss.
I think we should keep No. 2 experimental body.
The regenerative cells in its body
If I succeed in extracting it,
not only can it cure your illness,
but it can also be distributed worldwide.
Dr. Q,
Are you sure
you can control
this experimental body?
No problem.
I just need a little more time.
A little.
Dr. Q.
if the experiment fails?
Boss.
Look out!
Da Zhong!
Leader Qin.
Quick, run!
What's that sound?
What happened?
What happened just now?
Tell us.
Where is Zhong Wu?
Zhong Wu!
Why aren't you guys talking?
Where exactly is Zhong Wu?
Signal received.
Signal received.
Captain, captain.
There are survivors here.
Our ship has located your position.
Captain.
On the island...
Captain?
Even if the rescue ship comes,
we won't be able to escape the attack of the huge snake.
So,
before the ship arrives.
The mutated barnacles?
We'll give it
Jason.
Su Ji.
Try to create wounds for the huge snake.
Jason.
You seize the time
After the huge snake is led to point B,
in the direction of the cliff.
Destroy the huge snake
by making it fall on the mutated barnacles.
What about me?
Take good care of Yueyue.
Da Zhong.
Today,
I will either join you later,
or
I'll run away first.
I'll leave this with you first.
So touching.
I've long noticed something strange about you.
I am
Dr. Q
from the CASS Medical Group.
That huge snake
is my great masterpiece.
Why did you do this?
Human beings
They should evolve.
I want to change this world.
I want
Especially those
old professors...
they are all wrong.
It was their disregard for me
that made me a genius.
This world should
You are crazy.
It's here.
Be careful.
Bro!
Hey!
Come here!
I am Jason!
Big fool!
Who's scared of you?!
Come on!
Come on!
If
I hadn't changed the course
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Enjoy yourself!
causing extremely serious social impact, their chairman Ren Junyi has been arrested,
will we know what we are, what we have chosen to be,
angel or demon,
creature of light or monster clothed in human flesh.
He said I could choose, that I had a choice.
The silver service, I think. Not the china.
Miss Maud!
I must, for a moment,
speak not of your father's recent death but of his judgment.
Your uncle is hardly a fit person
I look forward imminently to that happy event.
Your Uncle Silas was a most expensive, vicious young man.
An acquaintance, rather.
Married beneath himself. Though, to do him justice,
I fail to see why a youthful mésalliance
should we fail to take into account
and consider the implications of the historic...
You proposed to be blunt, doctor.
That gambler took his own life.
Perhaps you'd care to view the suicide room, captain,
in your new capacity as trustee.
Another time, possibly. Thank you.
if you would care to mount a challenge.
You may remain trustees of my property.
rather than my own flesh and blood.
I will not challenge the will
or my father's choice of guardian.
- There's no shame in that. - I'm not ashamed.
but because my father was deeply, bitterly conscious
of his brother's disgrace.
You may go.
Oh my goodness! How exciting!
My dear cousin.
My dear cousin Maud.
I am so out of breath!
So delighted, but so fatigued after our dreadful journey.
My father's been shown to his room.
My brother, about the place somewhere.
The stables, I expect.
What good friends we shall be.
I've put you in the room next but one to mine.
We had a lovely walk today.
Don't rush your fences, boy.
Uncle.
You are most welcome.
Dear child, I rejoice to meet you.
Truly rejoice.
My daughter Emily has made your acquaintance,
the foundations of a lasting friendship.
Pray, allow me to present my son, your cousin Edward.
Where is your gallantry? Kiss your cousin, sir.
You modern young women are so correct,
and all the more alluring for your modesty.
Your servant, Cousin.
Cousin Edward.
Hmm.
I'll serve. Go on back down.
I hadn't thought about it.
You must, of course, consider everything in this house
perfectly at your disposal.
Come.
May the Lord bless you and make you all that I could wish.
Serve Miss Maud at once!
Yes, sir.
Not very.
You play pianoforte?
A little.
I must hear you.
By and by.
Mary Quince and I planned it.
Mrs. Rusk, the housekeeper?
Mary Quince?
My maid servant.
than contemplate my mortification in the next.
You are an heiress
I am Madame, the governess de votre cousine.
You, mademoiselle, having, of course, nothing to learn,
pas du tout, have no need of one.
Not these three years past.
my most gracious hostess.
You have done so. Good night.
That is my father's desk.
As it was my father's before him.
Evidently, neither was much for paperwork.
Ha!
Piquet?
Faro? Loo?
I do not care to play, sir.
Hmm.
Ground rent.
Rent roll.
Liquid assets.
Your trustees intend to keep a tight rein
on the purse strings.
- They are ridiculous, aren't they? - You needn't mind them.
I suggest an alliance. What do you say?
I believe, Uncle,
Come.
My dear brother.
He told you of me?
Yes.
What?
great faults, and great wrongs.
Your talents have not availed you.
Your faults, you repented for long ago,
but the wrongs done to you are still very sore.
Cousin Maud.
Are you quite well?
is hardly likely to tire me.
You'll have some tea, Edward?
You sinner, Edward. Now, Maud, isn't he a sinner?
Case of turtle, I should think, and get in some hock.
Do you care for hock, Niece?
Above all things, Uncle.
My daughter makes a noise like a pig.
No, sir.
I beg your pardon, Maud.
And also some claret, Rusk.
Two cases?
Three?
As you wish.
Emily, come.
See, if you just adjust the sight line here and here...
Goodness.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Cousin.
The weather is rather changeable here.
Touch of neuralgia.
My father was similarly afflicted.
Emily's governess.
- Yes? - You don't wish for me to obey her?
Only to be polite.
She's not my governess.
She's not responsible for your conduct, certainly.
Yes, my dear brother has appointed me to act in loco parentis,
but I shan't wield my authority without cause.
How I will enjoy introducing you to society,
A climbing holiday, perhaps.
I was just your age when your father and I first went.
His youthful passion, I understand.
I'm afraid I don't share it.
while in mourning... or even half-mourning.
Hmm.
as to whether Madame, being a French woman
and therefore clever with her needle,
Well, should you present your request
with sufficient charm, I may drop a hint,
a measure of docility.
a much better scheme.
Don't be vexed.
No, but I shan't trouble you with small matters of business.
Oh, yes.
I had no idea.
they found him half out of bed, his head hanging down,
and his throat cut by his own hand.
How horrid.
They scrubbed and scrubbed.
Did your father not tell you all this?
No.
There's no suspicion attached to him.
My father's reputation was ever unsullied.
I'm afraid the same cannot be said for yours.
I'll mention to my uncle you've been asking, shall I?
No. Don't.
Confess.
Confess!
It makes no sense at all.
youngest scion of our name,
and my daughter, Miss Emily Ruthyn.
I trust I find you well, Miss Ruthyn.
Very well. Thank you.
Tea, Cousin?
She is very striking, isn't she?
but we have overcome the deficit, as you see.
A hunting man, I understand.
My niece's foxes will be trembling in their rank little dens.
No, thank you.
You are, and I mean no disrespect by this,
unschooled in the ways of society.
I certainly hope so.
than your experience.
Pray, excuse me if I take a great liberty.
You are a prize, you know.
I do know.
If there's any service I can render,
anything at all that I can do.
For my property, I am to presume?
Indeed. Of course, for your property.
The good captain will find an heiress tres convenient.
The good captain thinks more of his wine, his horse,
a shrewd suspicion of the object of this tete-a-tete.
I haven't the slightest conception. Kindly move aside.
You know that it is totally impossible
and a charming girl such as yourself
to meet continually as we do
without a liking growing on one side or another.
I suppose I needn't pretend to be violently in love.
Please don't continue.
Beg pardon?
Mm-hmm.
A sincere attachment?
Most sincere.
You do me too much honor, sir.
Dash it!
Have the goodness to let me pass.
You will excuse the intrusion.
but I have not forgotten, if you have,
that my authority as guardian
gives me the right to question your conduct.
that you contemptuously rejected the hand of my son?
I rejected it certainly
with no more contempt than the question was put to me.
but under your tutelage, he will improve.
Really, my dear, think of the advantages.
What could be better than taking your own blood to wed?
Better, surely,
not to marry a man for whom I have no regard.
Not, I trust, in the direction of a certain captain
who makes nothing by his profession
Wise girl.
You have something of the look of your poor mother.
I'm afraid I don't remember her.
No? Delicate girl.
Sad.
My son's impetuousness has taken you by surprise.
I require no further...
I yield, my dear. I shall not press you.
You shall have time, your own time, to think.
I will accept no answer now.
Hurry up. You're letting the cold in.
A tribute to your beaux yeux, my dear.
Will find the arrival of bailiffs
more compelling than your posy.
This matter, to my regret,
does not concern you or your property but rather my own.
There will be no bailiffs at Knowl.
Your creditors have caught wind of the fee
compensating you for my guardianship.
Mm.
Ready money is not something
I have frequently been troubled with.
Perhaps I might communicate with my trustees
about releasing some funds.
What unwanted generosity.
If you'd care to, Uncle.
I'm on tenterhooks.
Tell me, how do you propose to inveigle your trustees
for securing your departure from Knowl
And if I decline your so generous offer?
Then I regret very much that the bailiffs will indeed arrive at Knowl.
And I will make sure they understand what is mine
and what is yours and therefore fair game.
I don't mind waiting a bit.
I'm in no rush to have a wife on my back.
Oh, very obliging of you.
I'm no hand at play-acting.
of a preux chevalier charging up to carry me off.
Surely you want someone,
I mean, I needn't trouble you much.
which he has been so obliging as to repeat.
without one word of discouragement,
There have been no attentions to speak of.
I have sought no attentions.
However, to be on the safe side, Uncle,
towards my cousin, your son.
You are excused.
Pray, excuse me.
There is something you should know.
We once made a bargain, my brother and I.
when that gamester took the coward's way out
- and put an end to himself. - Ah.
You play too deep, all of you.
That is true, at least.
The loss was mine.
Your father staked me.
That can't possibly be true.
Well, luckily, that other eventuality transpired.
I don't understand.
That is a foul implication.
your father took the steps required to preserve his fortune.
What steps? The door was locked from the inside.
You lie. You're a liar.
I speak truth, unaccustomed as you are to hearing it.
Uncle...
He was always the better climber.
The taint of suspicion was to be mine, mine alone,
as one day so would be Knowl.
That was the bargain.
Mm.
Oh, yes.
guardianship of you.
The trust with which he placed you wholly within my power
though sadly not my expected inheritance.
Excuse me, miss.
If mademoiselle has any petite commissions,
No, thank you.
Madame attend to mademoiselle's petite d'affaires.
You mustn't trouble yourself to go out.
Jet buttons.
Thank you, Uncle.
- Tea? - Brandy.
You, says one man of experience to another,
- Still, child-bearing hips. - Pater!
Fine eyes, and a pretty little foot and ankle.
Oh, don't.
It's so lovely.
We could be sisters.
It is enough that we are cousins.
Edward?
I'll accept your apology in the morning.
Now get out.
No.
No!
Get out of my room! Get out!
- Get out! - Quiet!
- No! - Shh!
or pretend to resist.
No, no, no, no!
No!
Edward. Edward.
Edward, look at me!
Don't do this!
Don't do...
Coffee please, Rusk.
Moderately well, Niece, and yourself?
Immoderately poorly, as I'm sure you're aware,
But I must thank you all for your kind concern.
I do think you've been a little cruel, my dear.
If there has been an excess of gallantry,
you only have yourself to blame.
My charms, I make no doubt, are near as numberless
as the quantity of pounds lodged in my bank account.
your son deigns to rape me?
My decision is unalterable.
I will not marry your son.
Well, I'm afraid no respectable man
will take a soiled article to his bed and board.
I find myself not much disposed towards marriage, Uncle.
Do you think it so little, my heart?
Yes, miss.
- See to them then. - Yes, miss.
The carriage, please, Rusk.
No, miss.
I require the carriage, please, Rusk.
If necessary, I'll drive it myself.
I'm sorry, miss.
The master said no, miss.
I am your mistress.
- Get down. - No.
- You'll hurt yourself. - Come on! Go! Go!
Let me lift you down.
Get your hands off me. Step back.
Mary Quince, I need you to post a letter.
I won't again.
Ilbury.
Ilbury!
Ilbury!
Ilbury!
Captain!
Captain, wait!
♪ Mama, sing me back to sleep ♪
♪ Don't ♪
♪ Cut ♪
♪ Me ♪
♪ Off ♪
Very sorry, miss.
Doctor.
Miss Ruthyn, do come in.
How would you say you've been feeling, Miss Ruthyn?
A tad confined, I would say. Thank you, Dr. Bryerly.
And yourself?
Concerned, dear, that you've been unwell.
We shall soon have you put right. Do not agitate yourself.
I'm not at all agitated.
You're to remain perfectly quiet.
I'm fortunate then to have at least one of my trustees to look after me.
as the consent of both of us is required
Be so good as to explain yourself.
No such things!
Doctor, a word.
Leave it with me.
You have three years until your majority.
And Captain Ilbury, does he share your opinion,
In certain nervous states,
a likely progression to violence of action,
to self-destruction even.
more or less disagreeable depending on the patient.
Hmm.
Even the most hardened cases
respond to cold water treatment.
Iron has a tendency to rust.
Thirty minutes for the most obdurate cases.
Something between 10 and 13 tons of water in that time.
Tons?
No, you are correct.
Irregular vibrations of the nerves
due to the peculiarities of the female constitution.
Couldn't sleep.
Nor I.
You know, less bucolic.
I'll leave the candle, will I?
Let's get you back to bed, miss.
No. Just lace me up tightly.
I can see you're a great deal under the weather today.
A period of seclusion, nourishing food, rest,
and no reading
or drawing.
Stand.
Stand, or I will have Mr. and Mrs. Rusk
lift you to your feet.
You're an intelligent girl.
Perhaps when you offered to overturn my father's will.
All this difficulty,
so unnecessary.
Submit.
Do you know what the medical profession prescribes
as a sure-fire cure for hysteria?
At weekly intervals.
But one doesn't need a panel of doctors,
far less a magistrate, to secure urgent treatment
for a troubled young family member in a benevolent institution.
Solely the signature of one doctor.
Our kind friend Dr. Bryerly, say.
But you will be better away from here.
But if I contest your treatment,
I'll wager me, and then I will be made a ward of the court
and you will be removed.
Of what do you think to accuse me?
Approval of the match my impetuous son
has been rather too determined to make?
I cannot be held responsible for any action of his, however reprehensible.
Hmm.
Say 50.
Done.
when you are under the care of a physician
50,000 pounds to be paid at once by my trustees.
At my majority, I will guarantee you and my dear cousins
50,000 pounds to be paid at once
will secure you respite from any further marital proposals.
Edward shall go.
I prefer to remain at Knowl.
In my father's house, there are many mansions.
Detente.
The carriage will be around directly, sir.
I should wait until after dinner.
The master has called the carriage, sir.
Dinner downstairs this evening, miss.
- That's plenty, Mary Quince. - Mrs. Rusk will do for you tonight.
Well, the master wouldn't trust her for it.
Mr. Ruthyn, I mean.
- They'll be so long away. - Both my cousins?
So says Mr. Ruthyn.
How we will miss them.
depart the ancestral halls,
It therefore becomes necessary
that your importunity should trouble her no longer.
I don't follow, sir.
my daughter shall accompany him.
A spell at a French convent will do wonders for you.
Et moi?
Indeed, monsieur.
but I shan't be required to task it further.
Monsieur.
Silas.
I beg your pardon?
You'll not part me from our daughter.
My dear Madame,
I fear you're not quite yourself this evening.
Emily, don't let him do this.
Don't.
Emily, look at me please.
Emily, please, my darling. My own girl. My own... Please.
- Don't touch me. Don't. - Please, please, please.
- All right! Enough! - Please!
You are, of course, perfectly free to accompany your mother.
No, thank you, sir.
Emily.
- No, no. - Now, now.
Come on. You're quite worn out.
I suggest you retire and rest up...
before you go.
Must I really go?
Must I repeat myself?
And Maud?
Remains at Knowl with me,
unless you would find a period abroad productive.
I shall, of course, remain at Knowl.
Miss?
Spiced claret.
Master says I'm to undress you.
And I say you are not.
My silence was a condition of my employment,
and yet you blame me and not him?
You chose not to trust me with your secret.
But I couldn't tell you.
But I thought you knew.
You did know.
I thank you for your service.
Madame.
Maud?
Such distress. Surely you're content you've banished my brother and me.
I would like to give you a memento.
A family piece, if you'd care to choose something.
If you wish.
Here.
Lie back.
Put her out.
I thought you might do the honors, sir.
Feet first. She jumped.
An irrevocable impulse of the unbalanced mind,
as the good doctor will confirm.
There's no need to reproach yourself.
- We gave her every chance. - Pater, I...
Don't be such a girl!
Pater, it's Emily.
Darling Maud.
Shall we go out together in a blaze of glory?
I have an idea. You go out and I'll stay here.
Glory needn't come into it.
So, tell me, Uncle.
and I would think that you in your delicate situation
The kind you showed me, for example?
I would have loved you.
You do love me.
We're the same, you and I.
Then why should my life be forfeit?
And not yours?
I gave you every chance.
Father!
Maud!
Captain Ilbury!
Captain!
Captain!
Captain!
- Oh, captain. - It's all right. It's all right.
My father is dead.
Come inside. It's all right.
We didn't know where to turn.
My poor cousin is quite distraught.
You'd only to say the word. I would've come to you.
Madame is also dead.
A double tragedy.
The prospect of Emily being schooled abroad
and no longer requiring a governess
An insanity, even.
Indeed, I'm not altogether sure of my uncle's state of mind.
Devastated, he was, at the prospect
that you had also expressed an intent to leave Knowl.
America.
Australia, I thought?
Australia.
I will so miss her when she's away at school.
The direful knowledge of good and evil
I wonder how I lived through that terrible ordeal.
Behold, the day cometh that shall burn like a furnace,
and all the proud and everyone that doth wickedness
shall be stubble.
my father always said.
Angels and demons, monsters and spirits,
Lies to the liars,
and truth to the one who comes after me.
Angels and monsters do walk among us.
The trick is to tell which is which.
I LIKE…
I LIKE YOU, JUNE.
I LIKE YOU, JUNE.
I LIKE YOU, JUNE.
I like you too, Phing.

-Here. -Thank you.
Hey.

Greedy.
But we can't equally be at fault.
You're more at fault than me.
Fine.
I won't tell anyone then.
Promise?
I'm going.
Hey, Guy. I need your advice.
I'm interested in this girl. Give me a pick-up line.
Phing.
I don't know. I'm impatient.
I just want to try my luck.
Uh…
then try this.
Walk over to her.
Don't say anything.
But send her a text telling her you like her
in front of her.
Damn.
That's awesome!
You know I'm joking, right?
Your mind is anti-anti social network, huh?
Thanks a lot, bro.
Sure.
<i><font color="white">Guy didn't understand</font></i>
<i><font color="white">But the joke is on Phing</font></i>
<i><font color="white">because Guy knows that Phing</font></i> <i><font color="white">never carries an umbrella on him.</font></i>

Oh, Tah, you came as well?
Hi, Master Guy.
Oh, I told June
that you're my Master.
You came up with that pick-up line.
You're quite sappy.
<i><font color="white">June.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Is this sexual harassment?</font></i>
Guy has three siblings.
Wow.
Hey! Awesome.
Tell me.
Pretty please.
Offer food to girls first.
Actually, just the first two bites is enough.
She'll then say…
That's so true!
If someone puts food on my plate, that's what I'd say, too.
{\an8}GREETINGS.
{\an8}HEY, WERE YOU IN THIS SERIES?
{\an8}CRAZY! THAT'S AN ACTRESS
ARE YOU FREE THIS SATURDAY?
Want to go?
Go where?
Oie. Go anywhere!
Eat, watch a movie.
A bit more special, the aquarium?
The aquarium?
That's so meh.
Hey, what are you doing?
Writing on her hand.
-Why? -Because I like her.
I want to prank her like you told me.
"Stupid."
No. She just fell asleep while studying,
you can't call her stupid.
She might be good at other things.
What about…
"black out"?
No one uses words like black, short, fat, skinny anymore.
DEAD
All right?
Umm…
Can we?
Or not?
But…
it should be fine.
Wow. That's so awesome.
It makes me want to have some siblings as well.
Actually, not everything can be used.
It's not working out.
Actually, there's a way to check
what the other person is feeling.
But when you're closer,
you touch their shoulder…
arm…
And…
next their hand?
Wrong.
I think this spot is better.
It's between intentional or not.
It's a sensitive spot.
It's what they call the death spot.
Well.
But you have to do it naturally.
If not, you'll be accused of sexual harassment.
June.
Tah lost.
Your turn.
Give it a try.
Damn.
This isn't right, huh?
Hey.
Don't you know what people are saying about June?
About?
-Oops. -See?
-Sorry. -It's okay.
-Isn't she just friendly? -No!
I'm confused why Phing calls you Master.
Listen to what our classmates are saying.
-Phing… -Really?
What are y'all talking about?
-Religion. -Politics.
Shit.
You're so damn smooth, bro.
See?
What a bitch.
Right, bro?
You're a goner.
<i><font color="white">"Guy…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">you're also quite funny."</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Stop it.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">That's your friend's girl.</font></i>
I put on two different sides
and totally different colors.
And like,
that was so embarrassing.
Oh, I just knew today that you're quite funny.
It's green.
Hey. Can we sit with you?
Sure.
Then, let's watch a movie at seven?
Okay.
Hey.
Why didn't you wait to eat together?
Well, you didn't tell me.
Yeah.
See? You're sarcastic again.
Always being sarcastic.
Like I said, next time I'll wait.
Where are you going?
Sit.
Phing, can you stop being a jerk?
Jerk?
Really?
Yup.
I'm a jerk.
Let's just break up then.
<i><font color="white">Huh?</font></i>
I'm sorry.
I'm always putting my foot in my mouth.
<i><font color="white">Huh?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Together again?</font></i>
And what am I supposed to feel?
I told you that I'm not like that.
I'm sorry.
-Stop being a jerk! -I'm not a jerk. You're a brat!
They're not gonna make it.
Let's not be like them.
Let me in, Lex.
June!
June.
I know I'm being a broken record.
But I really want to change.
I think if I'm with you…
I can be a better version of me.
Let me in, please.
-What the hell are you trying to explain? -You've never trusted me, right?
Just say it.
Say it.
I'm not breaking up!
Shit.
PRASERT WITTAYA STATIONERY
You're thinking I'm stupid, right?
Well, you're not stupid.
You're just…
a masochist.
I just found out that…
Always breaking up.
Hey.
I'm not giving out pointers, but…
it depends, do you like to cry or not?
Your sharp words have dried my tears up, see?
Hey, I mean it.
I'm not good at consoling people.
Well.
And…
But instead she told me off.
Hey…
don't tell me…
This is so unfair.
I really don't understand.
"I change guys often"?
I don't have any friends.
No one wants to be my friend!
<i><font color="white">Guy…</font></i>
I'm going to focus only on my studies.
Hey June, what's stuck on your tooth?
So damn ugly.
<i><font color="white">Oie.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">The gods at home.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">At the university.</font></i>
What?
Cockroach.
Shit!
Shit, on my head?
Damn! Guy, aren't you afraid?
Scooch in.
{\an8}HANDSOME.
{\an8}YOUR BROTHER?
Tah.
Has Guy ever done anything lame?
{\an8}A PERSON OR A DOG?
THAT'S ENOUGH.
MY PHONE CRASHED.
<i><font color="white">Well…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I think I'm someone</font></i> <i><font color="white">who's not good at anything.</font></i>
Like, there's nothing I want to do.
Or anything I'm especially good at.
It's so damn sad.
My older sister is like you.
She's constantly changing her job.
But she seems happy trying out this and that.
Like a reviewer.
What about you?
-Like-- -Fake.
You don't need to be cool.
That's how you do it!
Hey, you.
Sorry.
June's friend, right?
Cute.
I mean you.
Cute, my ass! I'm not some joke.
Guy.
Oh, never mind.
People are gonna talk.
Let's just stay put.
Then let's go in…
and stand apart?
Like we came separately.
<i><font color="white">Excuse me.</font></i>
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I heard June cheated with someone.
Can she really not stop herself? Don't you think?
Let's…
stay out of her business.
Why does it seem like you're protecting her?
Hey, I'm not protecting her.
But Phing's the one who told me.
Patty, let's break up.
I'm really sorry.
But I want to be honest about my feelings.
I don't think I really feel anything towards you.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
Guy!
Phing already broke up with June.
Damn it.
Fake news.
Shit!
What the hell?
Hey!
<i><font color="white">Phing and June--</font></i>
Can I have a cigarette?
Jerk, buy it yourself next time.
Thanks.
Excuse me. Can I borrow your lighter?
<i><font color="white">Nah. The conversation will run out quick.</font></i>
Inside is kinda loud, huh?
Smoking, of course.
<i><font color="white">If the answers are locked like that,</font></i>
<i><font color="white">then I'll have to attack.</font></i>
Careful, you'll get cancer.
Don't forget to remind yourself as well.
<i><font color="white">But what if it's a dud?</font></i>
Sorry if that was lame.
<i><font color="white">Okay, that's possible.</font></i>
Inside is kinda loud, huh?
What are you doing out here alone?
Farting.
Can I borrow your lighter?
I'm not really smoking.
I'm just here to fart.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry for laughing,
but damn, that was really something, Master Guy.
<i><font color="white">Oie.</font></i>
Hey, I'm sorry.
Are you mad?
I'll treat you to a round of beer.
Hey!
You cut me off!
<i><font color="white">All right. Thanks for today.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Pete & Friends is really glad to be here.</font></i>
Were you born in time?
YouTube,
Joox, Spotify,
Apple Music.
Yeah.
You have good taste.
What's with the compliment?
I like your friend, Lex.
-Huh? -A lot.
Help me out, will you?
Lex might be a bit shy.
That's how women are. Right?
Huh, talking to the wall.
-June. -What?
Well, just a while ago--
Well, at least I took my shot.
Have you ever taken a shot?
Hold it.
What are you mad about?
If you know what to do,
then you wouldn't have chosen Phing.
Why wouldn't I know how?
I'll bet five baht you can't get it.
Make it 500.
Deal.
Huh?
And when you called, why the hell did you start
with "I met Phing"? You should've jumped straight to the details,
Hello, bro. Listen to me.
It's called introducing the topic. Would most people start the conversation
I would have to start with, "Hello, I met Phing."
And then I asked him where June was. Phing looked really hurt.
And that's when I tell you Phing told me he and June have broken up. Right?
That's what normal people would do.
Such an idiot.
I was joking.
Just for laughs.
Bye, bro.
June, bye.
You don't have to walk me home.
I can walk by myself.
Damn!
What?
Damn it, my shoe!
Where?
-Damn, my shoes! -Hey.
Where? Here?
I'll find it myself.
Here!
I found it.
Nope.
Hey, it's fine.
I'll take this one.
There's no way we'll find it.
Yeah.
Thank you.
<i><font color="white">Get back safely.</font></i>
Oh, wait.
Never mind.
I forgot.
Thanks for walking with me.
Umm.
Bye.
What's up, Tah?
Excuse me.
Uh…
Thanks again.
No worries.
Excuse me.
Were you able to make your friend jealous?
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Well,
Give me a fake one.
I just want to make my friend jealous.
-My friend's sitting over there. -Oh.
Go and play at home.
Kiddie.
No.
I guessed wrong.
He wasn't jealous at all.
I think he's okay.
No?
Umm.
I'm Pete.
<i><font color="white">You stabbed me with the billiard's stick.</font></i>
I remember now.
Yup.
For this song…
start with the snare.
Okay?
<i><font color="white">I might not sing this song so well.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">please come up and sing with me?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Come on up.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Okay.</font></i>
No need to wave. Come on up.
Hey.
Just go with it.
June is good at choosing losers.
She'll break up with him soon. Trust me.
Doesn't he know that June doesn't like stuff like this?
<i><font color="white">No matter how other people are</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Even if no one offers a chance</font></i>
<i><font color="white">On the day you lost and made a mistake</font></i>

I have some good news.
<i><font color="white">But please know one thing</font></i>
I think Pete is gay.
<i><font color="white">That I love you</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Pete's this guy, right?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I stalked him.</font></i>

Why are we interested in this middle class guy
who is infatuated with a girl who isn't even his?
You don't have to get over being sad.
-A girl will come your way. -Jin.
That's how to get over someone if you've been dumped.
Oh yeah. He wasn't even chosen.
True.
Everyone…
-Aww. -Oh.
It's fine, puppy.
-There, there. -It's okay.
It's okay, my brother.
You'll be okay.
-Here. -Thank you.
-And bam! Bam! -Damn!
You're fucking awesome.
He stayed home and cried.
Lex, wait for me.
Hey, Guy!
Ban floats!
Nah.
But I think you still can.
Nah.
That boat has sailed.
Believe me.
Hey.
We're closed.
-I think you should con-- -Nah.

Buy some?
Oh?

Listen to me.
We're about to graduate.
What else do you have to lose?
TAH'S
I like you, June.
because you already have a boyfriend.
But I just want you to know.
And if you're not okay with it…
we don't have to mention this again.
That's fine.
Damn it, Tah.
I think this is kinda lame.
Hey, Tah.
Why are you crying?
It got me.
Forward the clip.
I'll send it.
Forward.
Oh.
NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY.
HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
I shouldn't have made you send it.
It's all right, bro.
Thanks a lot.
I'm so relieved now. All because of you.
I'm really grateful.
Why did you drag me here? It's so hot.
I'm gonna faint.
I said I'll treat you to lunch. Why are you complaining?
Okay.
Let's see how it comes out.
Let me check.

Kie.
Let's go over there.

Let's take photos together. I'll take them for you.
-Sure. -Okay.
C'mon.
Can you move a bit?
Oh, sure.
Aren't you going to look before snapping?
-I use my feelings. -Sure thing.
Are you into <i><font color="white">Top Gun</font></i> these days?
-See you. -Sure. Bye.

Take a photo for me.
Sure, Lil' Lex.
-Hand it over. -You're so sweet.
June.
How?
Good, huh? Tah finally has a girlfriend.
Really?
<i><font color="white">Congratulations, God.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">You won.</font></i>
June…
Sure.
<i><font color="white">What a waste of time.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I feel stupid</font></i>
<i><font color="white">It's so cliché…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">to feel regret when I've lost her.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">But let me ask…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">-Pete.</font></i> <i><font color="white">-Huh?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Well…</font></i>
Well…
I don't like things like this.
Let's go talk outside, shall we?
Sure, of course.
<i><font color="white">Let's call and ask.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Hold up.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">As a friend!</font></i>
Hey, what happened, June?
You can talk to me.
<i><font color="white">You're so damn nosy.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">No.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">She already knows you like her.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">This is just freaking lame.</font></i> <i><font color="white">Don't mix your personal life with work.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">That's the best.</font></i>
Hello, June?
June's in the shower.
<i><font color="white">Is it important?</font></i>
Oh, I want to invite June to work with me.
Oh, what kind of work?
A commercial.
A model.
<i><font color="white">Oh, sure.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Uh, June's here.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Here.</font></i>
-<i><font color="white">Hello?</font></i> -Hello, June.
My office is looking for a new model.
Are you interested in working together?
<i><font color="white">For real?</font></i>
Hey…
Of course.
Great.
Sure.
-Is that it? -<i><font color="white">Yeah.</font></i>
See you.
<i><font color="white">Stay cool.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Stay focused, Guy.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">You only want to know about her, right?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">That's right…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Right…</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Okay, Guy.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">You're fine.</font></i>
This person is okay. She's natural. An influencer. She's got 30K followers.
Sorry.
Kanin.
I like her.
I've waited four years.
I've given up several times.
There's a lot of crying.
Can she cry?
She's a total crybaby.
-Okay. -Thanks so much, Kanin.
Then I'll call and confirm with her.
<i><font color="white">Do mix your personal life with work.</font></i>
LOVE THE REAR VIEW
<i><font color="white">June, listen.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">More feeling.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Recall the bad things.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">More, more. Give me more.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I need ten times more.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Give me some tears.</font></i>
Cut!
End slate.
Guys, before the next take,
clean inside the helmet too.
Hey, June. Sorry, but…
Kanin probably wants more.
-Why don't you try… -Guy, enough. I'll brief her myself.
<i><font color="white">June, right?</font></i>
Actually, this shot is really easy.
<i><font color="white">Why can't you do it?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">That's why you have opportunities</font></i>
<i><font color="white">more than others.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">And get a chance at this job.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">But if you can't do something so simple,</font></i>
<i><font color="white">then you'll be left with only one thing.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Please do something to pass.</font></i> <i><font color="white">The entire crew is waiting.</font></i>
Cut.
What's next?
-Hey! -June!
Damn it!
June!
June!
Where are you going?
June!
-Hey! -Don't run!
June!
-Let's drink something. -Calm down.
-Please wait. -I'm begging you, June.
Calm down.
It's your fault.
<i><font color="white">Dad.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">I don't want to stay in Thailand anymore.</font></i>
Can I go live with you?
<i><font color="white">When I invited you over,</font></i> <i><font color="white">you never seemed interested.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">What does your boyfriend have to say?</font></i> <i><font color="white">Did you tell him yet?</font></i>
Why are you hiding out in the dressing tent?
Dad.
Then…
I'll call you later.
<i><font color="white">Okay, sweetie. Bye.</font></i>
Hey.
Are you sick?
Oh.
What the director said was right.
Pretty but stupid.
I'm so damn useless.
Actually, being a housewife might be better.
That's right.
Back then, why did I…
Hey. But I think you did the right thing.
Marriage isn't really a bad thing, I guess.
Sometimes it can be annoying.
Why?
Why do you pretend like…
Are you enjoying this?
You like me?
When?
Since?
Hold up.
Um, June.
You watched my clip… didn't you?
-Clip? -The birthday clip.
That's right. I thought you had watched it.
It said, "read."
And you turned me down.
What?
What did I say?
Really?
You told me,
"Sorry for being blunt.
Now isn't the time."
NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY.
I thought it was something important.
<i><font color="white">Instead, I saw a drunk playing a melodeon.</font></i>
And it was shitty.
So, when you said, "now isn't the time…"
It's 4:00 a.m.
And why didn't you?
For what?
I confessed I liked you at the end.
What?
Back then, I liked you too.
But I thought…
Did I?
Yeah.
Wait.
You liked me?
Hey, June!
Hold on.
Let's talk first.
June.
Hey, June.
Don't follow me!
Good night, everyone.
-Bye. -Bye, June.
Hey, June. Wait up!
Sorry.
Well, you just came out of nowhere.
Here.
No need.
Wait.
June.
June.
June.
June, wait.
June. Hold on.
Oh, you're back?
-No… -Stop right there.
<i><font color="white">Thank you!</font></i>
<i><font color="white">If Pete were a douchebag,</font></i> <i><font color="white">everything would be easier.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">and the male lead has an excuse for it.</font></i>
-Yeah, drink up. -I don't drink.
<i><font color="white">-He doesn't drink.</font></i> -It's okay.
It's fine. Okay?
-I'm really sorry. -It's fine.
<i><font color="white">Polite.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Isn't there anything bad about him?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Please make me feel less guilty.</font></i>
Kie, please agree.
See? Goy has agreed to do it.
It's just for fun.
This isn't any fun at all.
Secretly recording people getting pranked? You've got no taste.
It's an infringement of basic human rights.
Calm down, will you?
It sounds fun.
Plus, I get money.
Thanks, Goy.
My name's Grace.
-Just ask him for his number, right? -Yeah.
Can I take a picture with you?
Oh, sure.
Kie, move.
Hey.
Yes.
My place isn't far from here.
<i><font color="white">Damn, Pete is invincible.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">What to do?</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Shit. This world is so crazy.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">If you can't be the better person,</font></i> <i><font color="white">then be bad.</font></i>
Hold up! Calm down!
Let's talk.
-I'll be the baddie for you. -Please, no!

JUNE'S BIRTHDAY
<i><font color="white">But the date I booked</font></i>
<i><font color="white">is an important day, Pete.</font></i>
Hey, how can the plates be like that?
I wonder too, Pete. It's so funny.
"Inside is all broken.
Just open it."
What is it with men and quips?
Men?
Since I'm leaving…
Actually, I don't have to go.
Well…
cancel it.
Then…
I was joking.
-I won't do it anymore. -Okay.
You should go.
I'm going for real now.
I did.
And why didn't anyone tell me that Guy liked me?
Everyone thought you knew.
What do you think Phing and Guy fought about?
Over Patty.
Oh, shit.
I guess you could see it that way.
The thing is, you didn't finish watching the clip. Damn.
Why are you mad at me?
Fine, my bad.
So, what's your next move?
See?
I'm engaged.
Oh, shit.
And another thing is, so I don't stray.
Oh? Friend of June's. Where are you going? Let's go together.
-I'll have to… -Let's go. Come on.
-Birthday, birthday. -I have errands…
Let's go sing.
Hurry.
C'mon.
<i><font color="white">Happy birthday</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Happy birthday</font></i>
You didn't think I'd come, right?
Happy birthday. Open it.
Happy birthday, sweetie.
May it be filled with happiness.
Thank you.
Sorry, everyone.
I…
Bye.
Tah, are you doing well?
Yeah, I'm good.
How about you, Pete?
-I'm doing well. -Okay.
Oh, Pete.
-Can I ask you something? -Sure.
-I'm just asking. -Sure.
Well, no.
I believe causing trouble for others
is wrong.
Right?
You're so cool.
You look a bit out of sorts.
So I'm a bit tired.
I think I'll take a shower and go to bed.
Okay.
{\an8}RELIEF OF SORE THROAT
{\an8}TAH, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT CLIP?
<i><font color="white">I like you, June.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">because you already have a boyfriend.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">We'll just continue to be</font></i> <i><font color="white">good friends like this. That's fine.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Hey, Tah.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Why are you crying?</font></i>
Would you like to order anything else?
It's okay.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Well…
I wanted to talk to you about…
I'm glad
that you like me.
But?
But…
Sorry. I really can't accept your feelings.
I… meant for today to be the last day to see you.
Let's…
move on from this.
Don't joke around.
I'm serious.
I'm also serious.
then you can block me.
You've already made your decision.
it's not that I don't think about you too.
when I think of doing something
or sometimes I want him to even cheat on me.
Even though he didn't do anything wrong at all.
Thanks.
Thank you, really, for…
understanding.
Well…
I'm going to leave now.
Wait, hold on.
Since it's our last day,
have a beer with me.
One pitcher and I'll go.
Don't laugh.
When I broke up with Phing,
That's not flirting.
I remember.
When you were with others,
you were so polite.
But look.
When you're with me…
you're so cheeky.
So…
why do you like me?
And you want me to answer right now?
Hey, you're so annoying.
Just answer.
When…
I've never been with anyone and felt so naked.
With you, I feel the world is easy.
{\an8}WANT TO GO TO THE AQUARIUM?
You said you understood.
I do.
You said today was our last day.
But 24 hours isn't up yet.
Let's go. As friends.
{\an8}WHAT A SLOW POKE, JUNE.
{\an8}YOU'RE THE SLOW ONE, GUY.
Ugh.
It's been flooding every day.
I guess the government is being romantic.
Like Venice. Get it?
The water's really high.
I can't go any further.
Get off here, okay?
Oh, sure. We'll get off here.
June.
June.
June!
Choose me.
What's wrong with being with me?
I'm sorry. Calm down.
-It's done with. -Rie caught Nhoom having an affair.
I already told you everything, Rie!
I admitted I made a mistake.
We have kids together!
I'm sorry.
-Get out of here! Get out! -What about our kids?
No, Rie.
Keep your chump change and get out.
-What do you want me to do? -Go!
Get out!
What about our kids?
-I already broke up with her. -Like I said, I can raise them myself.
Can you give me a chance?
Think of our kids!
-Get out. -Feel sorry for our kids.
They're mine as well!
I'M BLOCKING YOU, OKAY?
She posted a picture of them together,
Maybe she was trying her luck.
So, she set off the bomb.
I feel like…
I can't continue on.
I understand everything.
I just don't understand.
You didn't do anything wrong. It's all on me.
Pete, you're a nice and good person.
Right?
It's me who's not ready for a lot of things.
I might be too young.
I…
I don't have a future.
I haven't achieved anything.
I might be a bit selfish, but…
if I'm still with you, then all I'll ever be is
"June, Pete's girlfriend."
"June, Pete's housewife."
I don't like the person I am right now.
I'm sorry.
Right?
Well?
Yeah.
It's okay.
Don't cry anymore.
Want some water?
I'll get you some.
CAN WE TALK?
Don't get up.
Sit.
Look at this.
What's this?
Well?
Say something!
Explain!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hello?
Damn it, I'll go. Sorry, bro.
What the hell?
Damn you.
Where's June?
She's gone!
She left it for you.
<i><font color="white">Hey.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">Sorry for leaving you this letter.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">To tell you the truth,</font></i>

{\an8}When you put your ex's name in the song,
{\an8}at the time, what were you thinking?

This is Chambal.
And this small village is called Bilgaon.
And this fellow sitting on the roof is Manoj.
And very soon he's going to decide...
"and clean up the country of corruption."
Anyway, let me begin this true story
"I won't accept defeat, I'm not that easy to beat..."
What did you think?
Didn't he tell you?
He's been suspended.
I'm here with the suspension letter.
I won't accept it.
Come, son. Give it to me.
Here.
Kamlesh! Get your grandfather's rifle.
Please hear me out!
Out with it.
Talk!
Why haven't you signed this seed-distribution file?
The farmers never got their seeds.
The Mayor siphoned them off.
How dare you accuse the Mayor?
Type up his suspension letter.
You crook! You and your Mayor sell seeds on the black market.
Here's the second time!
Type his suspension letter right now!
What do you say now, Grandma?
And twice?
Hey, Ramveer!
These thieves don't deserve a shoe.
They deserve a bullet. Kamlesh, shoot him!
Have you gone mad?
-Leave me! -Shut up. Don't interfere.
Blow his brains out.
What happened?
Just stick the notice up!
Remember that.
Grandma's plan to send us to jail was foolproof.
No one dares lay a finger on my son!
Nonsense like this has gone to his head.
I've decided. I'll go to the High Court.
I won't spare them.
Don't you eye my pension. I'm not giving you a rupee.
That pension is not just yours. It's also his father's!
Don't worry, Ma.
I'll pass my school exams and become an office boy.
I have to pass this year.
Nice job, bro!
Listen carefully, you lot!
Remember last year?
what happened?
There's a new system this year.
I'll write all the answers on the board.
-Fantastic system! -The first answer...
x2-3x+2=4
x=x-1...
Does that mean no cheating?
Nothing will happen.
What's going on here?
You are our esteemed guest. Welcome!
Can we talk in private?
This way...
Our Principal can handle him.
He'll fix it. Don't worry.
Please come.
What do you think, Deputy sir?
can become engineers, doctors, or officers like you?
Never.
Even if they studied day and night, they'd never pass the 12th grade.
But with a little help from us, they'll pass.
No, not me.
The Mayor. After all, it's his school.
Hello? Mayor sir?
Yes, DSP Dushyant is here. Here, speak to him.
The Mayor.
You're making a mistake, DSP sir.
This is Chambal.
The kids of bandits study here too.
If one of their kids fail,
they'll burn your house down.
Never mind all that.
We were expecting you.
Told you, he's a badass.
He fixed it.
Take a photo.
His son fails and he doesn't give a damn.
No, he's off to the High Court to reform the country!
The whole village failed.
He'll pass next year.
Had he passed, by now he'd be an office boy.
Now where will the money come from?
Do you even care about us?
I care about the whole country, Pushpa.
Please wait.
Let me go.
Let me fight.
You'll fight on an empty stomach?
No vegetables today?
Close your eyes, Ma.
Where the hell were you?
Your father's gone.
You weren't even home to say goodbye to him.
Close your eyes, Ma.
-Why? -Go on!
Just close them!
Now open them.
Where's this from?
Our troubles are over.
-We are earning now. -How?
I'm the driver. And he's my assistant.
I'm glad your grandfather died in the war,
or he would've died of shame.
Where are you going?
Are you new?
It's the rule.
Whose rule?
The government's? Or the Mayor's?
Same thing, kiddo.
The Mayor's bus never runs empty. Get off.
But there's no room in your bus.
Shall I make room?
There! It's done.
Move it! Don't waste my time.
Let's go.
I'm not scared of anyone.
You'll end up dead.
You won't listen to me?
This is the first time anyone has hit the Mayor's man with a shoe.
Here's the second time!
You're a dead man now.
Start the engine.
Let's buy ten rupees of sweets for Ma.
She'll be so happy.
Hey, what's that?
Stop, stop!
Hey, get down.
-Why are you getting off? Wait. -Sit in that bus.
You'll find out in a minute.
-Make it quick. -We've done nothing wrong.
-Police station? -What did we do?
I'll tell you what you've done.
Arrest them!
In you go!
-Is that him? -Yes, sir.
-He's the Mayor's man. -Shut up!
Hot-blooded like his father.
-Don't insult my father! -Or what will you do?
Speak up!
-I'll shoot you with my Grandpa's rifle. -Really? Go on then.
Go. Get your Grandpa's rifle.
Go.
Get the rifle.
Frozen now?
Go, Manoj.
-Get the rifle. -Don't be scared. Go!
Go!
-Go! -Get the rifle, Manoj!
Dushyant sir!
Dushyant sir!
-It's very urgent! -Shut up!
Dushyant sir!
Be quiet, he's asleep.
Dushyant sir!
Sir.
Jackie, sit. Who's this boy?
Sir...
Come tomorrow. I'll look into it.
-Sir, but... -I said, tomorrow!
Let's go, Jackie.
Get out.
Go!
For us, it's tomorrow?
Why did you come on time that day to stop us cheating?
If you'd come the next day, I'd have passed. Found a job.
Earned for my family.
That day you cared about honesty!
Your men will shoot my brother tonight,
I spit on such honesty.
Stop!
Go sit over there.
Prop your leg up.
Jai Hind, sir.
Tell him.
Sir, I was riding in their rickshaw. They were smuggling alcohol.
He's lying.
Carry on.
I said, "I'll call the police."
He ran his rickshaw over my leg.
-This leg? -Yes, sir.
You can go.
Go, go home.
Sit down.
I thought you went to get the rifle.
That was smart, brother. You saved my life.
I think that's Dushyant Singh's car.
-Namaste, sir. -Hello, sir.
Get in.
Get in. I'll drop you home.
You're pretty tough for a little guy.
What's your name?
Sir... Manoj.
Manoj, talk to him about our rickshaw.
Sir, may I say something?
Sure.
Our dad is an honest man. Like you.
When I saw you, I realised...
You cheat, but your words are wise.
Good!
Sir, you can stop here.
Thank you, sir.
What nonsense were you talking?
Ask about our rickshaw. Go!
Sir, one last question.
Yes?
Sir, I want to be like you.
What should I do?
Let's go?
I'll become a big cop. Like him.
Great idea. Do it!
Don't worry about money.
The Mayor's school went back to its age-old tradition of cheating!
To make ends meet, his mother sold the family's only valuable possessions,
one after the other.
Come, my little one...
Shut the door.
Get the trunk out.
So much money?
It was tough hiding it from your mother.
Go.
Don't worry about expenses.
Your grandpa would be proud seeing you in a police uniform.
Grandma!
-Phone every month. -I will.
Listen...
A surprise for you.
It was hard to find.
-Is this the right book? -Oh, yes!
Start studying on the bus.
Hurry.
-Call us as soon as you get there. -I will. Take care.
Sorry.
You can sit here.
Sweetie, come here, let him sit.
Where are you going?
Gwalior! We've reached.
Everyone, out. Last stop.
Gwalior. Get off.
Wake up! We've reached Gwalior.
Mister!
-Was that your bag? -Yes.
-What? -Yes.
That was my bag. How could she take it?
She's gone.
Hey!
Mister!
She got off an hour ago in Barua.
She got off an hour ago in Barua.
[Pratiksha Coaching Centre, Gwalior]
She got off an hour ago in Barua.
Go!
Your grandpa would be proud seeing you in a police uniform. Go!
What time does the coaching class start?
Don't you read the newspapers?
Why? What happened?
The government is broke.
No money to pay salaries.
How can the government do that?
Off you go.
Go!
The boy from that small village was lost in the big city of Gwalior.
A war was raging inside him.
The day his hunger got the better of him,
he walked in.
Uncle ji?
Uncle.
Yes?
I'm starving. Could I have some food?
I'd happily do some work for you.
Boy, give him a plate.
That was the day I saw Manoj for the first time.
He polished off the plate in under two minutes.
Sir, it was delicious.
No, no. Just tell me, I'll do anything!
You're a student, right? Pay me later.
Everything I brought from the village got stolen. I have nothing.
Hey!
Why? Who the hell are you?
It's not just your exams that were cancelled. All of ours were too.
What's done is done.
I can't.
Why not?
so I'd become a DSP.
What will I tell her?
That her money got stolen and I ran back home?
It's like a Greek tragedy.
Namaste, Papa. I'm on the train.
Yes, I'll phone. Don't worry, Papa.
Okay, see you.
-Are you going home? -No, to Delhi.
Why Delhi?
You don't know the civil service exam?
The IAS, IPS exam.
IPS?
The Indian Police Service exam?
You came to become a DSP, right?
Senior to a DSP?
A DSP has to slog for some 20 years to become an IPS officer.
I will become an IPS officer.
-You're kidding me, right? -No. What time is the train to Delhi?
Yes, I will become an IPS officer.
Let's go. But on one condition.
I pay for your meal.
Give me the change.
Hurry, hurry!
I could see how happy he was, that he'd be senior to a DSP.
But once we entered Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar...
Manoj!
Manoj?
Where's the champagne?
Now?
Champagne's drunk at night, no?
I brought bread and eggs for now.
Come on.
Manoj!
Manoj...
Are you okay?
There are millions of students.
How will I manage?
I can tell you how!
There are three exams. First the Prelims, then the Mains.
I've known him since I was 15.
His final result is due next week.
I bought a special red shirt for the occasion.
So bring them inside.
He spoke to us in spite of so many students being there.
Yes.
That's it?
So close to the finish line.
Restart!
Restart?
I've failed five times in five years.
That's when I realized what was missing.
Motivation!
So I got this police uniform,
You heard right.
The open category gets four attempts.
Brother Gauri.
Can I talk to you... in private?
-Are you English medium? -No.
Tell him.
Go on!
Brother...
I'm a little short on funds.
Can you help me get a job somewhere?
-Can you? -I'll do anything.
-All right, consider it done. -Thank you, Gauri sir.
The toilet needs daily cleaning.
UPSC students study here.
I'll pay 280 rupees a month.
And a room to sleep in.
But if you're five minutes late, I'll cut the entire day's wages.
I'll be five minutes early, sir!
All right.
Hariram, show him the room.
Thank you, sir.
Pass me the glass!
To your first job!
-No, no. Not for me. -Pandey-ji?
May I have a little?
Here, Tutul.
This is the first time I've bought such an expensive bottle for anyone.
It's good.
Blowing up dirty money is very satisfying.
My father is a contractor for the Public Works Department.
He wants me to do the same.
to become a Deputy Collector.
Double the dirty income!
Then that got cancelled, so he says go to Delhi for UPSC.
I don't want to do that.
No one's ever asked me that.
Man, I'd like to be on TV.
-Really? -Yes!
But I don't have the balls to tell my father.
Tell your mother then.
I would have...
if she was alive.
Tutul wore his new red shirt, with Gauri's uniform in his hands.
But Gauri couldn't find his name on the list.
Gauri had failed his last attempt too.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
What will brother Gauri do now?
Tutul, switch on the light.
[Restart Tea Stall]
If any one of you becomes an officer, it'll be my victory too. Got it?
What say, Manoj?
-Guidance will be free. But, Tutul... -Yes, sir?
Charge them for the tea.
Got it, Gauri sir.
Let's go.
Restart from zero!
This is no school exam.
It's the UPSC Prelims.
They can ask any question from any subject. Got it?
Read the newspaper, listen to the radio.
Your Prelims are tomorrow.
It's your first time. Don't get nervous.
Got it, everyone?
All the very best!
Go, get 'em!
Manoj Kumar Sharma.
Fail. You've failed.
-What? -Fail.
You've failed. Next!
Pass!
Restart!
Manoj hit restart in his life.
He worked in the library for another year.
He studied hard, and whenever he could, he'd help Gauri.
The interview is about who you are.
Right? So, be yourself.
For example,
the final question they asked me was...
And I said, "Sir, I don't think about them."
-Coffee? -Sir, he's not a tea-boy.
I'm so sorry, Manoj.
It's okay.
Sure.
Give it to him.
-I'm so sorry I called you that. -Never mind.
I owe you one.
If you ever need help, come to me.
Nice coffee.
But Manoj didn't realize this.
And me?
Oh, aromatic coffee!
Such deep lyrics!
Tutul!
-Three coffees, buddy. -Right away.
Welcome, Naval.
Listen, bro...
Thank you...
First class!
Gauri sir! I'm off.
-Bye! -Bye!
Where did you find him?
At Gwalior station.
He hadn't even heard of IPS.
But said, "I'll be an IPS officer."
I brought him to Delhi.
wanting to become IPS officers.
Hello, Gauri sir.
I mean, no disrespect...
You can't become IPS officers.
Just accept it and move on!
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
We come in herds, stuffed in buses and trains.
We come with nothing.
Our fathers have nothing.
They all slog under the scorching sun, just like my father.
But you should know, we don't come empty-handed.
We never give up.
Our will is rock solid.
And this will isn't bred in some fancy school.
It is born from the hopes and dreams of millions of Indians.
Our will is our wealth.
Winning and losing is all part of life, Naval.
Manoj...
Get up, son.
Isn't it your second attempt today?
You still have time.
Go, shower first.
You remind me of my UPSC days.
I sat for the exam four times, from this very library.
And?
And 30 years later, you're here!
What happened?
-What news? -I passed!
-Are you serious? -Oh, my God! Congrats!
That's amazing.
My Manoj has made it!
I'll buy you some new ones.
He cleared the Prelims. That's no joke.
-Bravo! -Brother, the phone?
Of course, here. Call her!
I first met him in Gwalior. He hadn't even heard of IPS.
But he was hell-bent on becoming an IPS officer.
I brought him here.
Hello! This is Manoj. Get Ma! Hurry!
Search all of Mukherjee Nagar, there's no better coaching than us.
Yes, I've heard about you.
Professor Arora will be awarded the Padma Shri next month.
Look at this.
We capture the moment our students become IAS and IPS officers.
No one else here does this.
I know! That's why I've come to you.
Ma'am, is a higher discount possible?
I've already offered you 10%.
Ma'am, please. Money is a slight problem right now
1200...
I'll pay the rest in installments.
-You are unbelievable! -Please, ma'am. I really need this.
Fine, we'll work it out.
Hello, ma'am! Hello, sir!
Professor Arora's daughter.
He's going to be awarded the Padma Shri next month.
-Oh, nice! -Yes.
You see this?
We capture the moment when our students become IAS and IPS officers.
Ma'am! You've made a mistake. Deep Mohan didn't study here.
Please fill up the form. I'll just be back.
What the hell?
Ma'am, you're mistaken.
Have you ever met a movie star?
What?
The biggest celebs? Have you met them?
No.
You think they chew the same tobacco they sell you?
It's called advertising.
-What was he saying? -Nothing.
Didn't Deep Mohan study here?
Of course, he did. See? That's him.
See... how happy he looks.
What were you saying?
She's lying.
She calls it "advertising".
Are you lying?
Of course not!
Show me his admission form.
-Pardon? -Very good idea, Papa.
Show his admission form.
I can't. It's a private document.
Let's go, Papa.
I don't want to study here either.
How can that be?
Don't show your face again.
We don't want to see your face either, madam.
Yes, sir.
Have a good day, sir.
Wait... please don't worry.
We'll find a good coaching academy.
You're also looking for PCS coaching?
No. For the UPSC Mains.
Where did you coach for Prelims?
Wow! What's your name?
Manoj Kumar Sharma. And yours?
-Sh-- -Let's go, dear. Thank you.
Sir!
If you need any help,
I'm at the Vidya Library all day, studying.
Sure. Thank you!
Hello! Get out, please.
Yes. Thank you.
It was the first time a city girl had spoken to him.
Manoj kept thinking of that girl.
Whose name he didn't even know.
You're an engineer?
You?
Aeronautical?
I thought you'd gone home.
Hi! I'm Shraddha.
Manoj.
-Yes. -Nice.
Please have a seat.
I see.
-You know Company Garden? -Yes.
There's a small road that goes up the hill from there.
My house is 50 steps away.
Did you study in Mussoorie too?
Yes.
Wow!
So Papa said, "Go to Delhi.
Er...
-Gwalior-- -Hey, boy!
I'll do it right away.
Do it right now!
Yes, sir.
Do you work here?
Yes, work in the day and study at night.
Absolutely.
-Would you like to go to Delhi Haat? -Sure.
Please sit down.
Around 2000 of my students have become civil servants.
IAS, IPS and PCS officers.
All high-ranking officers.
To be honest, out of those 2000 students,
Know why?
as it is to understand
that you should not be respected for your rank,
A day will surely come when you visit me,
Who is Manoj Kumar Sharma?
Please stand up.
You? Please come here.
Come.
Don't worry.
Why did I call you here?
You know what you've done?
Did you write this?
Yes, sir.
Relax! You've done well.
I read all these yesterday.
Manoj's essay.
The topic was "Terrorism in India".
The Naxal insurgency, Jammu-Kashmir, the Northeast...
Usually, I give one chocolate, but he deserves two.
Let's give him a big hand.
Take your seat.
And how it is different from other forms...
For you.
This heart is no longer sore
Now Pandey's solus days are sore no more!
-Lonely! -Lonely!
Time for round two.
Truth or dare?
Dare!
Yes! Sing that song.
Manoj! No... something else, please.
You have to sing.
I recited my poem. Surely, you can sing your song.
-Go on. -Okay.
What the wind murmurs to the cloud
You sing really well.
Thank you.
Round three.
Why is it something you cannot utter?
Why are you content to stay mute?
-Sure. -I'll get it.
Why must I only read in your eyes?
Won't you say something?
Hi!
Where were you?
Just a second.
Happy Diwali!
Shraddha, how can I accept it?
Like this.
Thank you.
I really wanted to read this book.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Last Diwali?
And as usual,
Then I thought... why can't I have power?
I can absolutely have it.
I can also become a Deputy Collector.
I told Papa and he said, "Go to Delhi!
Do you recognize this rocket? Fireworks from your childhood?
The principle is the same.
-Anyone? -Why don't you answer?
I don't know the answer.
Say whatever you know.
He's an engineer.
An aeronautical engineer.
He has also read Abdul Kalam's book.
I thought you had a BA degree in History and Hindi?
Am I mistaken?
No, sir. I am a BA student.
So what's the confusion?
Sir... it was a misunderstanding.
It's easy to mock others, right?
I was holding an engineering book and she...
Manoj?
Saheb is calling.
You all right?
Yes.
Yes.
What is this?
Money.
From where?
Really? Only 4,800?
Last year's scrap sold for 6,200.
The scrap weighed 400 kgs.
12 rupees a kilo makes 4,800.
See Hariram? How easily he lies.
once he's an IPS, he'll loot the whole country!
Son of a thief!
How dare you call my father a thief!
We are not thieves!
He stopped attending class too.
And where did I finally find him?
Malka Ganj, Lane no. 6.
Is this where you live?
Why did you quit the library?
You're a mess.
Forget me. Go, meet Shraddha.
She's going to Mussoorie for her Prelims.
Apologise to her.
I'll apologise once I've cleared my Mains.
And how the hell will you do that?
How will you study in this darkness?
Like this.
How will you face Shraddha then?
I'm good here...
This is the time to study hard. Not to do all this.
I kept after him, but he wouldn't listen.
How did it go?
Fantastic!
The interview call is certain.
Congrats!
-Which one? -The one on terrorism!
In class, I wrote a great essay in Hindi on that subject.
So I just translated it to English.
Which question was on terrorism?
Not a question, the essay. Look at page two.
I wrote in great detail.
Reason, impact, how to solve the problem.
Difference in Punjab terrorism, Kashmir terrorism, Insurgency, Separatism...
Okay, but where the hell is it?
Second page. First question.
Learn to read English, bro, please forget the IPS.
It's not "Terrorism in India". It's "Tourism in India".
T-O-U-R-I-S-M.
You've failed.
And he thought the interview call was certain!
that he has left the city and gone somewhere.
45, 46, 47...
48, 49, 50.
-Namaste. -Namaste.
-Who are you? -Manoj. Her friend from Delhi.
I see.
May I have the address?
Hello? Kishan here.
Sure.
Shraddha-ji, your friend from Delhi is here.
Yes. Here...
Hello, Shraddha!
Manoj?
How did you get my address?
Why have you come?
To apologise to you.
Can we meet for five minutes, please?
How come?
How could you make such a mistake?
I thought you'd be so happy to know that my English exam went well.
In the excitement, I didn't double check the essay topic.
And instead of studying again, you've landed up at my house?
Yes, I...
I wanted to tell you something.
Speak up!
Shraddha...
I love you.
What?
Yes.
Now you also say it.
Say what?
Just... "I love you."
Then I'll turn the world upside down for you, Shraddha.
Please give the phone to Kishan.
Huh?
He's gone inside.
Call him back.
Shraddha, but...
Water?
Yes, Shraddha-ji?
All right.
She says you should go back to Delhi.
Manoj...
My dear friend!
You're looking good.
Where have you been?
Delhi.
Thank God you're here.
What happened?
Rajni!
Brother!
It's been so long...
Is Papa okay?
Yes. He wrote a few days ago.
You've grown so tall!
Where's Ma?
-She'll be back by evening. -Evening?
And Kamlesh?
He's a daily-wage earner.
Brother, are you a DSP now?
Where's Grandma?
Where's Grandma?
Hey?
Tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
-We haven't even told your father. -Why not?
She used to say,
"My Manoj will only return in a police uniform."
Rajni!
Yes, Ma.
Pass me the oil.
Sit here, my son.
We're all okay.
Kamlesh is earning good wages.
I'm caring for them again.
It makes me so happy.
Please stop lying, Ma.
Please.
The next time you're home, you'll be in uniform, won't you?
It'll be okay, my son.
Don't cry, Ma.
and studied through the night.
-Brother Gauri? -Look who's here.
Who?
Sir, I'll go now. I'll bring breakfast.
Papa?
Please sit.
Here.
I'll get water.
What brings you to Delhi?
I've come to take you home.
Let's go.
Let's both go home.
We'll sell government seeds on the black market
and make lots of money.
What are you saying, Papa?
My mother died and no one told me.
Because I was busy with my fight.
But your mother was always right.
I'm just a fool.
Let's go back home.
I'll fall at Chauhan's feet. Get my job back.
People like us will never win.
Nor will we accept defeat, right?
Papa...
Don't you remember?
I won't accept defeat, I'm not that easy to beat
I won't accept defeat, I'm not that easy to beat
I won't accept defeat, I'm not that easy to beat
I'll write a new rhyme, On the pages of time
I'll sing a new song...
-Sing a new song... -It'll all be okay.
It'll all work out.
It'll all work out fine.
-Water... -Yes.
Papa, don't worry about money or our home.
I'll take care of it.
Here.
and sleep for three.
Then one day...
What good is a date palm tree for a traveller?
It has no shade for the weary and no fruit they can reach.
You must've heard of the poet Kabir Das?
From a 1000-year history of Hindi poetry, if I had to choose a poet,
I would choose Kabir.
A revolutionary poet...
She had called.
How were your Prelims?
-Excellent, sir. -Very good. Take a seat.
-Hi, Pandey! -Hey, Shraddha.
Where's Manoj?
Inside. Go, meet him.
Hi, Manoj!
Hi!
How are you?
I'm sorry, Manoj.
It's okay.
No, it's not. I shouldn't have been so rude.
I was shocked when you showed up suddenly... it was hard to...
I called back a minute later, but...
But... you were gone.
I'm really sorry, Manoj. I was very rude to you that day.
Thank you for being rude.
This is no time for love.
I have to focus on studying.
I have responsibilities.
Pandey told me.
What?
About your grandma.
I better go.
Manoj, can we go and talk somewhere?
Can we talk after my Prelims?
All the best, Manoj!
Thank you.
Then came the Prelims result.
I failed for the third time.
Papa, I didn't make it. I worked so hard.
I finally cleared the Prelims.
I don't give a damn!
-Sorry. -Pandey!
-Where's Manoj? -I'm on the phone!
Where's Manoj?
How the hell should I know?
Stop here, please.
Tell me.
Shraddha?
-Manoj! -What're you doing here?
Obviously! I knew it.
-Can you stop this noise please? -Yes. Sorry.
Let me just... sorry...
Move a bit, please.
Sit.
After the exam, I checked every answer.
We need to score 98 to pass.
Watch me, I'll clear the Mains, too.
You'll need to write many essays.
I know all that. I'll manage.
How will you manage?
Pandey said, you work 15 hours a day.
How will you... manage?
Manoj, I have a request.
Stop working here.
-I will lend you some money. Return it-- -No, I don't need money!
Please.
If you don't need money, why work here?
You won't understand. We come from different worlds!
Sorry, I...
My father is in court fighting corruption.
My elder brother...
is a daily-wage earner in a distant village.
I have responsibilities.
I understand, Manoj...
but how will you study in this darkness?
Papa always said...
I have my own bulb.
He did have his own bulb.
But in the Mains exam,
And when the results came the outcome was no surprise.
But despite that, in the middle of the night,
I couldn't bear it.
My man Naval cleared the Mains.
What a party we've had!
Brother Gauri, it was epic.
Fantastic.
-Congratulations, Naval! -Thank you.
-Congratulations! -Thank you.
-Congratulations, Naval! -Thanks.
But shouldn't you party after the final selection?
I've celebrated often after the Mains.
Brother Gauri, don't worry about Naval.
His selection is a given. Ask me why?
Why?
Because in his life, he has no Shraddha to distract him.
Shraddha, don't be upset.
Pandey!
The way Tanya walked away.
She just left.
Get it?
Manoj?
Look at me.
"Dear Manoj, what are you doing these days?"
What will you say?
"I am working at a flour mill."
Or "I'm running a rickshaw between Morena and Jaura."
-Pandey. -Will she want to be with you?
-You're drunk. And talking nonsense. -I'm trying to drill sense into him.
All girls are the same.
No one wants to be with a loser.
She'll be gone in minutes.
Shraddha!
-See? Gone in minutes. -Shraddha!
Remember what you said?
That you'd turn the world upside down if I said, I love you.
Manoj...
I love you.
Now go and turn the world upside down.
Deep sir knows me.
-Sir... I'm Manoj. -Sir, he just ran in...
I got coffee to Tanya's terrace. You called me a tea-boy. Remember?
-Oh... Manoj. -Yes, sir.
Leave him.
Tell me.
Not now, Manoj. I'm busy.
You had said, you owe me.
Please, sir. Just five minutes.
Please, sir.
Come in.
Check the pointers and draft the letter to the Home Ministry.
Yes, sir.
I have to deal with something.
You first, sir.
Talk.
Sir, I get through the Prelims but the Mains are a challenge.
You just have to check the right box.
But it doesn't work for the Mains.
I'll manage it, sir.
3 hours, 20 questions.
I'm saying out of 9 minutes,
-Do you understand? -Yes, sir.
Nine exams in total.
But I can, sir.
-Prakash? -Yes, sir?
Get me a pen and paper.
Sorry, sir.
You have 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Write 200 words.
What topic, sir?
-What's your full name? -Manoj Kumar Sharma.
But that's too easy, sir.
So get this done.
Right now! And give me a minute.
-Time. -Sir, just a minute...
It was too easy for you, right?
Manoj Kumar Sharma.
On a topic you know so well...
you couldn't write more than 90 words.
How on earth will you write 200 words on International Relations,
Internal Security, Social Justice, Governance?
Manoj, drop that.
What happened?
You can't do it.
you'll never make it.
But I don't have a choice.
You don't get it. Come here.
Clear my room out.
-Move Manoj's stuff into it. -What?
No, Brother Gauri.
I'll send your family money.
No, Brother...
-No, Brother! -Shut up!
Another word and I'll bury you right here.
It's our fight!
Even if one of us wins,
Bro...
-Right now? -Now!
an electric stove,
and a bed to sleep on.
And the next morning...
Excuse me? Does Manoj Kumar Sharma live here?
It has only one rule.
Start when you sit to study.
Stop it when you take a break.
Correct!
Then write.
Here... start!
Live the life that you like!
And here's dinner.
Thank you, Tutul.
Live the life that you like!
Don't give up before you fight,
Strike, man, strike
Strike, man, strike
-Hi! -Hi!
-I'm going to Mussoorie. -Why?
For my PCS Mains, idiot!
Manoj?
Hey, Manoj?
Wake up!
She cleared her Mains. Her interview is next month.
-Happy? -Very.
Thank you!
Remember, double the amount from your first salary.
Louder!
Come on, man!
Shraddha is waiting. Come! Run!
Congratulate your parents as well. He's here.
Hello?
Manoj, I've cleared the interview!
Meaning, Shraddha has become a Deputy Collector!
His motivation had now become his inspiration.
He was turning pages of his answer book,
as if he was turning the world upside down.
And I?
I'm sorry, Papa. I...
Please don't shout. I tried my best.
I gave it my all. Please...
Do what you want. I don't care anymore!
Pandey, give me your phone. I need to call Shraddha.
-Did you pass? -Yes! I did.
Well done.
You want to call Shraddha? Here you go.
I failed.
But you don't give a damn, do you?
I gave you a place to live. These clothes you're wearing, I gave you.
You want to call Shraddha? With my phone?
You and your girlfriend can go to hell!
If you have the balls, go confront your father.
We're all extremely happy, Ma'am.
Quickly... it's your mother.
Tutul, get sweets.
-Yes, Ma! -Congratulations, son!
Thank you, Ma.
-How's Papa? -He's very happy.
He's gone to the Gwalior High Court, to appeal again.
-Congratulations, Brother! -Thank you, Rajni!
My little brother, becoming too big!
Thank you, Brother!
Listen, I need to make an urgent call.
One minute, hello!
-Manoj? Hello? -I want to speak to him.
He hung up.
Congratulations!
This is Shraddha's mother.
Namaste!
Sorry, I thought it was Shraddha. This is Manoj from Delhi.
-Yes, I've understood. -May I speak to her?
She's not home. I'll tell her to call you.
Yes, Aunty. Please tell her. I'll be waiting.
Of course.
Hello?
Hello? Manoj?
Congratulations!
Thank you, Shraddha.
Sorry, it took me so long.
Never mind.
You're coming to Delhi, right? For my interview?
Why not?
I was sleeping with you in Delhi.
What?
It doesn't matter.
Ridiculous!
Shraddha, let me talk to your father. Let me explain--
-Hello? -Pandey, where the hell are you?
Come and get your friend.
Hello? Who are you?
Just come and get your friend.
From?
Mukherjee Nagar police station.
Your friend is in big trouble.
Yes? Your name?
-Manoj Kumar-- -Manoj Kumar Sharma, sir. My friend.
I wasn't abusing, Manoj, I finally told Papa...
-No dirty money! -Shut up!
So...
Tell me, what has he done?
He was shouting in a public place and was abusive.
I told him to calm down, so he started shouting at me.
At a police officer!
He wouldn't dare. I would've clobbered him.
Should I have waited for that?
Under which IPC section have you arrested him?
-Section? -Yes.
He paid a fine of 3000. He must pay 2000 more.
Show me the evidence.
Show me the evidence.
I'm sure you're aware.
It's not a fine. It's a bribe.
It's called corruption.
You're asking for a bribe in front of an eyewitness.
Your senior sitting there, who can hear you
is an eyewitness.
the first document I sign will be your suspension.
Remember that.
What's going on?
Sir, he's taken a bribe of 3,000.
-Give it back. -But, sir...
Give it back!
Let him go.
Manoj, that was amazing!
This is the first time I've seen a cop return a bribe.
Give me your phone.
Want to speak to Shraddha?
Talk to her the whole night.
What is this?
You called her father?
What the hell is this?
Bro, I made a mistake.
Don't show me your face again.
-Sorry-- -Got it?
You shouldn't have told Manoj what your father said.
He believed a stranger's word, Mummy. He really hurt me too.
Doesn't he trust me at all?
You remember?
that I wanted to quit medical school and join the civil services.
But what did he do? He said, "Go to Delhi.
He set me up to live independently.
Why? Because he trusted me.
Not anymore.
I still trust you, my child.
No, Papa. You don't.
But I would never do that.
Please, Papa. Please.
A tie won't get me through the interview.
Don't make the same mistake.
Brother Gauri, a tie won't get me selected--
-You have to wear it. -Shraddha?
-You look so graceful. -Thank you.
-And get him a haircut. -Thank you, Brother Gauri.
The IAS or the IPS haircut?
IPS.
I was just wasting away.
At that point, Manoj came back into my life.
I've come to thank you.
Don't thank me from the doorstep, come in!
Come.
-Sit. -No! I have to rush for my interview.
Interview?
You came to see me before your interview?
All the best, my friend!
-All the best! -Thank you.
-Hi, Shraddha. -Hi.
Shraddha, I'm really sorry...
I should never have called your father.
If you hadn't called he wouldn't have said,
"I trust you! Go to Delhi."
Then I did well!
By the way, you lie so convincingly.
You should become a TV reporter.
-Me? On TV? -Good idea.
How are you feeling?
They pinch.
What's this?
No! Not now.
This way.
This way.
Have a seat.
Tauheed Raza.
Rahul Gupta.
Alpana Bharti.
Khushiram Chaudhary.
Priyanshi Shrivastav.
Manoj Kumar Sharma.
Manoj Kumar Sharma.
Manoj Kumar Sharma.
Manoj Kumar Sharma?
Manoj Kumar Sharma?
Yes, sir. It's me.
Take him.
Your chairman is Dr. Mehta.
Got it?
Go. Do well.
Namaste, sir. Namaste, ma'am.
Namaste!
Please sit.
This is Mr. Manoj Kumar Sharma.
He's from Bilgaon. That's in Chambal.
Mr. Sharma has graduated in History and Hindi Literature
He has a 1st division in 10th grade.
And a 3rd division in 12th grade?
Surprising!
And... oh?
You failed the 12th grade?
Mr. Sharma?
Mr. Sharma!
Yes, sir. I failed.
Why?
Just say your grandmother passed away that year.
That year, they stopped us from cheating in our exam.
What?
He stopped us from cheating and the whole school failed.
"Stopped us from cheating."
Anyway... thank you for your time. You may please leave now.
Didn't you hear me?
Leave!
Yes, sir.
Manoj, whether you're an IPS officer or a flour mill worker,
Will you marry me, Manoj?
Sir, you are being called inside.
Yes, please sit.
It didn't feel right, ma'am, to hide cheating by cheating again.
Then why cheat in the first place?
Yes, ma'am. Very wrong.
And everyone cheated. Except for me.
Had I cheated, I'd have passed with a 1st division, like in 10th.
Took me almost 19 years.
But I was the happiest.
That day, I realized...
Those in power never want to let it go.
If the poor remain uneducated,
"Educate, Agitate and Organize!"
With such provocative statements, you should aim for a career in politics.
Sorry, sir.
You talk big,
I don't think you fit in here.
No, sir. I do fit.
-Really? -Yes, sir.
How?
Because language is just a medium.
That's just an excuse for you to cover your weakness.
No, sir.
Mr. Sharma...
you've said, you fit.
Now convince me you fit.
May I have some water please?
Go ahead.
No, ma'am, may I have a steel glass?
I'm not used to these.
-Is the water clean? -Yes, sir.
So drink it.
The water needs to be clean.
They haven't seen cheating in a village school.
-Really? -Yes, sir.
Maybe not better, sir.
More worthy.
How can you say that? I think you're delusional.
Everyone has seen his photo.
I've seen his photo, sir.
Barefoot!
Mr. Sharma, let me tell you one last thing.
If Sir Edmund Hillary had not found the way,
your Sherpa would've never reached the peak.
Anyone else?
Which attempt of yours is this?
But, I won't accept defeat,
I'm not that easy to beat.
I will not rest till the goal is reached.
It's your last attempt. How will you reach it?
The goal is to reform my country.
That...
if I cannot be the Sun that lights up the Earth...
If I cannot be the Sun that shines upon the Earth,
I can still be a lamp and light up my street.
Good.
Be a lamp. You may go now.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Waste of time.
A month and a half later...
I won't pass.
In that case, we'll work at the flour mill together. Okay?
Sir, are the results out?
I don't work for you, lady.
No time to mourn Dreams that are slain
No use to woe on, With a smile I'll go on
Tell fate I'll return, Tomorrow is my turn!
What happened?
Manoj?
You check. I know I won't make it.
-Manoj... -You look, I can't.
What do you think, Miss Qureshi?
What about you, Mr. Yadav? You've been very quiet.
Broken strings play A melodious sound
and my friend, is an IPS topper, Manoj Kumar Sharma!
Pritam Pandey reporting live on TV for the first time.
He's done it!
He's become an IPS officer!
What are you staring at?
Hey Manoj!
You've become an IPS officer?
Yes, Ma. I have.
The next time you're home, you'll come in uniform, won't you?
Yes, Ma.
-You've done it? -Yes, Papa. I have.
That corrupt Chauhan should know
To tell that corrupt Chauhan
One from this angle.
Now take the wide shot.
Now, go for video.
Congratulations, Mr. Manoj!
Congratulations for this, as well.
Just say, you were coached at A2Z. Okay?
Camera on.
Mr. Manoj Kumar Sharma...
on this momentous day, tell everyone which coaching class you went to!
I don't think you recognize me, ma'am.
Three years ago, you asked me a question.
Do you think movie stars chew the same tobacco they sell you?
-Today, I'll tell you what's wrong with it. -Stop recording!
Bloody idiot!
What's your result?
IPS.
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
The first invite for my wedding, sir.
Thank you!
You don't remember me.
I stopped cheating, sir.
Sir!
This is Chambal.
And this small village in Chambal is called Bilgaon.
And the twinkling lights that you see...
that's Manoj's wedding procession
on its way to Mussoorie.
What do I tell you of this wondrous land?
A jewel of the world!
Now let me introduce you to a few exclusive guests.
You recognize that face?
Shall we leave?
Got it?
Or do I take you back to zero... and restart?
Sir, this is an excellent property.
In the daytime, no lights are needed at all
An important thing to note, there are no mosquitoes here.
The doors have also been recently refurbished
The house has been recently painted.
You will get both bore water and metro water for entire 24/7
And beyond that, this house is really lucky!
Even the previous resident,
..had no heart to leave this house.
No, they are also tenants.
I think he'll be great company for you
-Hmm -But don't miss this excellent property
But I'll discuss with my wife and let you know.
Fine then. Wait a second.
I'll hand over the keys and come
Alright.
but it's better than other houses we saw.
-Hmm
And there is a family downstairs too.
It will also enhance your safety.
Fine then,
I'll call you after looking at them.
-I'll send you. -OK.
Some of them are wondering why there's a special class today.
Here's a song for those who are in a dilemma about waking up
Hey hold it properly, careful.
Move over there and play.
Play carefully! don't break the windows
-Hmm okay -Aathika
-Aathi
Hmm
then why are you doing all of this?
Then who else will do all this?
I'll do all this.
The doctor advised you not to strain yourself, right?
Hey, it's only books.
- Hmm
Everything has been moved, sir.
It's done?
Okay sir
Hey, hold on -Sir
Thank you sir
Yes, I'll go check, dad.
-Hi -Hi
The new tenant from upstairs, dad.

-Selvi! - I'm coming.
They are the new tenant from upstairs
-Welcome - Hmm
One moment
Tea or coffee?
-No,sir.Trichy - Oh, I see.
My parents are still there.
They honored me with a silk shawl.
What are you studying?
Engineering, final year, sister.
Oh, nice.
Fifth month.
I've been in this area for over 10 years.
Oh
It's been 37 years, I'll be retiring next year.
In this area, EO. Ilamparuthi holds a special respect.
What can we get with that respect?
you should still get the things we need for this place, right?
Always citing the same reason,
that I'm saving money for my daughter's marriage.
Look, he's been trying to fix that old radio since morning.
Almost we have unpacked everything mom..
only kitchen items are left,
In the next two days. -OK,dear
Give me the phone.
How can I go against your father's wishes and come there?
Has anyone from Aathika's family spoken to her?
At least you're speaking from our house,
what is preventing them from speaking? Is it ego?
Mom,I'll call you back later.
Okay, take care.
What happened?
You just wait and see.
Things will be different after the baby is born.
We'll take care of all that later.
-Ganesa!
Ganesa (shouting)

No, Uncle. I provided an appropriate quote only
Aparna,it's time. Please hurry up

Could you please book another cab ?
The cab driver wanted to cancel the ride.
Try an another cab.
Only the auto's available.
Since it's already late,
we'll take an auto.
Brother.
Please watch the ups and down, ride carefully.
-Please go patiently. -Yes sir.
You should be careful from now on,
Just two months left
Aathi,
Yeah!
Sister,he didn't help me with the previous contract.
Can he at least help secure this new one?
Someone who knows just the clerk is earning more!
And my uncle is an EO! He's capable of helping me a lot,right?
Could you refer me to uncle to secure the water tank contract?
Selvi!
Coconut chutney!
I have grinded Coconut.
Oh,is it?
Place it aside
Do you really think he'll listen to me? You should speak up for yourself.
All of a sudden?
Yes Sir, a sudden plan.
Oh I see!
Congratulations!
Sir,if you could move your bike a little,
we will park our car here.
Yeah,one moment.
Inform this to the house owner, brother.
I've already informed him before booking the car.
Okay.
What's the on-road cost?
Around 8 Lakhs sir.
-Ready cash? -No, sir!
Really nice!
The first car that came to this house.
What's for lunch?
Anchovy fish curry and fry.
-Paruthi sir! - Yeah
Super sir,
The car is the best investment.sir,
..is really exhausting, sir.
Then,when is the treat,Sir?
No sir,
-The car... -Sir,It's not his car.
Please slice it,
I also thought he owned the car.
He won't even spend 1000 rupees for a tire change
He keeps fixing the same puncture repeatedly.
You think he'll buy a 10-lakh car?
Okay fine,
Stop chattering and complete work.
Wait I'll butter him!
With the increasing petrol prices, how can we manage a car, sir?
Slice an another tender Coconut,
Aparna!
Just a minute, dad.
Come quick, it's getting late.
Just a moment dad.
It helps the engine to settle.
Hey buddy,
I'm taking my wife out for dinner.
Let's plan for another day.
Absolutely not. What's the time?
I'm not coming!
Who should I ask to take my wife out?
Oh I see
After finishing the dinner,
We'll take a romantic long drive along the beach coast,
shall we?
Oh,you have time for a romantic getaway?
Shall we?
No, leave!
Hey!
Hello, yes, sir.
Brother,
It is challenging to park my bike here,
Could you move your car a bit?
Okay.
Keep going!
Keep going!
Keep going.
It's fine now.
Sorry sir!
Hey,it's perfectly fine.
It's okay.
-Hmm.. -Hey!
Hey boy!
Hey, stop! I've been calling you repeatedly.
Sir, Mr.Balaji sent me.
Yeah,
One moment.
Thank you sir.
Brother, please move. - What?
Who are you?
Bob Marley, - What?
Hey stop!
Hey, I've been yelling, and you're just moving.
Yo!
Then,how will I wash the car?
What?
Just answer my question: Do you need someone to wash this car?
When there is a  gardener for just four plants,
What...gardener?
Hey, just stop!
Gardener? - Dad, coffee!
Hey, you stay!
Hey, go inside, go inside.
Go inside, I'll have the coffee.
Sir, I have cleaned the car!
How did that happen?
Selvi! - Yes
Hmm
If the gas has been delivered, I've left the
Fine, I'll pay them.
What happened brother!
Sir, could you please come here?
Oh my god,
What's this scratch, brother?
You just bought it, and already...?
When I parked my car last night, there wasn't any scratch.
It should have happened after I parked it.
It's so confusing,Sir.
I don't understand
Maybe while you were parking?
what?
May be by mistake or so?
Brother,
Sir,
Sir,
Sir, the scratch was caused by this
Car's paint mark is also there.
Right here!
Yes,it is.
Last night, it was dark,
and I may have accidentally scratched it sorry.
And this has happened
I will take care of the expenses.
Next time, be careful while parking your bike
Brother,
"please be more careful."
That's enough said.
Don't utter any more words.
I struggle each time to park my bike in this tight space.
I didn't mean that.
To maneuver my bike,
I'm requesting you to provide enough space
If I give you extra space
then how will I get down?
Sir, we need to make some adjustments.
How can you be so careless?
The repair is expensive unlike your bike's repairs.
The showroom will charge me a lot.
It costs 300 rupees to replace a brake wire.
General service costs 950 rupees
and you're talking as if it's so cheap.
let it go,sir
I know you guys are working hard!
Additional effort is needed on your part
Eshwar!
As a senior programmer, you have the responsibility!
I hope you understand the situation!
Hmm yeah.
I think, it's time to prove our self,
Sir!
I felt anxious earlier today...
sorry sir!
"Sir, do you consume alcohol?"
Your question wasn't wrong, brother.
Let's not dwell on it, sir.
Sir, do you drive a car?
I drive quite well.
No, brother, it's an unnecessary luxury.
Can't you just buy a new bike?
What's the issue with my current bike?
Has that bike ever started with just one kick?
Hmm.
Brother,
than to spend on a new bike
Why are you being so thrifty?
Brother,I'm not being thrifty.
I have a daughter,
I need to save for her wedding,right?
Don't we need to spend on ourselves as well?
Even now,
Unlike you I don't have the courage to put my wife at risk.
If savings aren't useful to us why are they called savings?
Brother!
Today it's just two of you.
Once your wife delivers,
Then you will realize the value of saving.
School fees,college fees, and so on will accumulate.
Expenses will continue to increase.
the expenses will be even higher!
Raising her, educating her, her wedding expenses,
and then her baby shower and delivery expenses..
and then the expenses for rituals for grandchildren..
What are you even talking about, sir?
Marriages don't need to be luxurious,right?
in a registrar's office like you did?
Sir,I didn't mean that way?
Then how?
I understood brother.
I really did.
I sat with you for drinking despite the age gap
Sir.
Who is he to give me advice?
I shouldn't have accepted his invitation.
It's my fate.
The mixer jar's blade isn't working again
What should I do now?
Look at the guy upstairs
See how he cares for his wife.
A new jar must cost around 300 rupees, right?
Hey!
Hey!
Have your meal; I'll check the door.
Wait, I'll check!
Yes,Sir.
Please come and take your car
Kindly wait for five minutes.Sir,
I'm not interested in your formalities.
Please come and move your car.
Please move your bike first, then continue eating
Please wait.
What happened?
He's really annoying,
asking me to move the car.
Is he a district collector?
Let him wait.
[Please check the drawer]
[How can I search when I'm leaving for college?]
Please leave quickly.
Hey!
Sir,
Where is he?
He just now left.Sir,
Sir,
Mind your own business!
Sir,what happened?
Release my hand, please.
Sir,Please.
what is this?
You're really pushing it and testing my patience.
Please,let it go.
Are you supporting him?
Be quiet. I will harm you.
You stay here.
He pushed the bike and now he's pretending he's unaware.
Stay out of it.
Please don't act. -Sir,
Today, he pushed my bike and now he's acting like he's innocent.
I just moved it a little.
Who authorized you to move my bike?
Who are you?
What should you have done instead?
I didn't want to bother you, so I...
You pushed it.right? -Sir,
stop saying that.Sir,
I'll park my bike wherever I want.
Who are you to question me?
I will take care of the repair cost.
If I damage your car with a stone, will you accept my payment?
This is how I speak.
The only way to sort this out,
Please move your car from here.
Then where will I park?
Park it on the street.
I've been here for ten years..
imagine how much arrogant I could be.
I pay higher rent than you do.
Respect can only go so far with him
Who do you think you are, bestowing respect upon me?
I've been living here for a long time with dignity.
If I speak,everyone will stand with me!
I'm not bothered if anyone comes.
I will continue parking my car here
similarly,
If your bike obstructs the path,
it won't fall by accident next time.
I challenge you.
You are crossing your limits.
How dare you talk to me like that?
Did you think I'm a joke?
Mr.Paruthi
Both of you have good jobs, so why fight over a parking spot?
With only one parking spot, why not adjust and park your vehicles?
I've adjusted many times, and in return, he made me walk on the street.
Sir, I parked there by mistake that day.
So,what now?
It's not that one day sir!
Ever since he got the car, I've been facing problems.
A long-haired boy comes to wash his car.
but he's peeking into my house under the pretext of it.
That won't be effective; tell him to park his car outside.
How can I park my new car outside?
Sir,Calm down!
During the floods, it was the upstairs tenant who helped you,right?
I don't want any assistance from him!
I simply need a parking space for my bike, nothing more.
Ok,Sir.
You can use the parking area to park your bike.
I'll park my bike wherever I want!
If you want to park your bike anywhere, do it in your own house.
Brother,calm down.
How can he park his new car on the street?
So?
You have to adjust because you have the bike
Brother, you can park your car inside.
It's annoying to be called for such trivial matters
He's telling me to adjust, and that too in front of him
You have to adjust because you have the bike
I don't know all that, sir.
I want a car that costs more than eight lakhs
There are two models in your budget, Swift VXI and ZXI.
Both models are available in both automatic and manual versions
If you book now, you can get it in 15 to 20 days
I can't wait that long, sir.
I'll pay the full amount right away!
I need the car today itself.
huh!
(giggles) -Mom,come here
Come soon
I'm coming.wait
What so urgent, Look there
Whose car is that?
It's ours.
what are you saying?
From now on, only our car will be parked in this parking area.
Mom!Mom
Leave me.
he made such a fuss!
Mom,
Red color always symbolizes luck!
Do one thing then,
Take a photo of yourself sitting like a boss and post it here!
Here's a sticker featuring your name, 'Ilamparuthi'!
If you place a government logo here..
Mr.Paruthi
When will you treat me?
but I paid in full cash!
From now on, you should park your car outside
Ignore him,Sir.
Get a miniature of your younger self that long hair..
Brother, -hmm.
Then how should I interpret it?
Isn't it too much?
hmm..(confused) - Aparna
Yes,dad.
aren't you done?
Your phone is continuously ringing.
come soon.
Yes.coming
Buying car and bike are easy nowadays!
Sir.
Sir!
The professor's house compound has parking space
you can park your car there.
He's a friendly person.
Move..
Sir,I live next door.
You appear educated, so what did you think of us?
There is space near your house and you could have parked there right?
Seems like you'd even park inside my house.
But I'm facing parking issues at my own house!
Search for a nearby house with parking..
That's the best option. -Yes,he is right.
Give me that, -Hey!
Only two days left. Please finish it.
Suriya, -Yes.
There's an emergency with my wife; I need your permission
Hey,
You mentioned a meeting and a potential delay
But you have arrived soon?
Yeah,only to see you.
Is it? -Yes.
Once it arrives, I'll take care of it. Now, hang up.
hmm
Sir, he arrived in the afternoon and parked his car.
To cut my hair! -what?
Sir,what happened?
hmmm.
Hey,move aside.
That day, you argued  over a minor scratch!
but now you've damaged the car.
Don't worry.
My parking space is available. You can park your car there.
No,it's ok.
why only 1000 Rupees?
Leave him.
You could have at least informed me, right?
He just arrived here. Why is he so arrogant?
-I'm going to damage his car. -hey!
why are you instricating him? can't you calm down?
I definitely need to go shopping this weekend
Just a heads-up
okay sure.
Don't you know?
My clothes have become tighter.
Okay,will go
But..
But what?
If we take our car, he will park his car there
You bought the car for me, right?
Alright, here's what we'll do I'll bring Arun's car
we can go in that,okay?
hey!
Brother,where are you?
ok.
Eshwar,
Sir,
Yes,tell me
Okay.Go ahead.
To access the sump, you need to move your vehicle
I will come. -ok,sir.
Brother,
How long will it take?
More than half an hour,sir.
wrap up the work soon.
Sir, we said it would take 30 minutes
It's done,Sir.
Ensure not to change the phase switch.
Hey!
Is this how you behave?
Ya, come on,
How could you hit an old person?
He has done a terrible thing
You have eloped with her.
You don't have the right to speak about respect
I won't even take your age into consideration!
Please get up.
He slapped him regardless of his age.
(Someone please inform their house owner)
Dad, let's go inside, please!
Could you adjust your dress, please? There are people watching
Why are you behaving like this? -Leave me.
Hey! (angrily)
How dare you lay your hand on me?
What will you do?
I will show you who I am!
Madam, He's been living here for ten years. How could he hit him?
Shouldn't he have respected his age?
Eshwar acted impulsively, sir.
So, will he behave recklessly out of anger?
Sir,
I'll ensure no more problems happen
Please end the call.
The landlord called and shouted at me.
Do we deserve this? Are you a rowdy?
You've struck an elderly person!
I'm talking to you,Eshwar !
He's as old as your dad.
That's why I just stopped at one slap.
Oh no, Eshwar! Let him say whatever
Go do your work.
Sorry, actually today...
You could've called or left a message..
I would've sent Balaji for the demo
Very disappointing. Carry on with your work.
That day, I suggested teaching him a lesson but you stopped me.
Now look, how dare he lay his hand on my uncle.
Wait and see what I'm planning.
Hitting him will only cause pain..
He dared to touch me, didn't he?
I'll report him and he'll face the consequences
Dad, Please. let's avoid escalating this.
His reputation suffered due to the slap.
Dad,please don't make this situation worse.
Hey, what are you even saying?
He simply spoke out of anger,
Dear, you should report him
Mom,please don't shout in anger.
Let's request the landlord to evict them from here.
Will everything be fine if they leave?
He's been respected here for years
Uncle,
You're young and might not grasp all of this
Please,go inside.
Mom,Let's leave it.
-He is innocent,mom! -Hey
Do we really need to go that far?
You want to report him, don't you?
hmmm.
(Oh No,Mom)
(Filing a complaint is unnecessary)
(Stay out of this)
Let me tell you something.
Think about it.
Tomorrow, I'll apologize to him.
Ok?
Staying here won't bring us peace
Don't you believe me?
Ok, Tell me
Fine,
I'll search for apartments.
hmm
First floor,
Huh?
Hmm
Who's Eshwar here?
For what?
What complaint?
Eshwar, what happened?
It's nothing, Aathi.
No need for that nonsense. You better come with us.
Why do you keep repeating the same thing?
Eshwar
You're pretending to be innocent, aren't you?
Aathi, stay there. Don't get out.
Sir, please release my hand
-Aathi, you... -Eshwar,
I won't stay quiet.
Sir,It's him.
hmm
Sir,
Is he the person you reported?
Sir,
Where do you work?
I work in IT.
You look fine, but your actions are that of a scoundrel!
Sir,
Constable, please bring his daughter here!
Okay,sir.
Sir
Why involve his daughter?
His daughter will obviously support him, right?
You can ask the neighbors,
Why do you even communicate with him? Put him behind bars.
Is he a big shot?
you will face the consequences.
Is he the one who misbehaved with you?
Sir, what are you asking?
-Hey, -Sir.
I'm asking you, girl. Tell me!
Aparna
Tell me, dear.
Could you please explain what happened?
Yesterday evening around 7pm
My daughter went to the terrace..
He attempted to misbehave with my daughter.
Hey
I'm thankful I arrived in time.
Sir,
he and I have a different issue.
Hey, stop it.
Don't talk.
Scoundrel!
He slapped me in front of everyone, ruining my reputation.
From now on, how will someone respect me?
-I feel like dying. -Dad
Will you agree when they ask?
Dad,
Just say "yes."
Yes, Sir.
Hey!
Take the appropriate action against him, sir.
We shouldn't spare him.
Sir,You take your daughter home. I will deal with him.
I will come and handle this.
Aren't you ashamed?
I tried my best to resist
but dad convinced me and took me there
If he convinces you, will you do anything?
I felt really bad for dad.
Because of your emotional weakness he has put us in this terrible situation.
I don't know what else he'll do!
Dear,
Go bring an advocate..
or request the complainant to withdraw the case
Go and arrange something.
Would Eshwar behave like that?
He hit you and that's a mistake
Please. Sir,
Hey, who are you?
Who are you?
Get out!
Balaji, please wait outside.
Aathika
We will handle it with an advocate.
I've done very little to him..
wait and watch the trouble I'll cause him.
He should not be at peace even while asleep
Ma'am, can you convince him?
What's there to talk to her?
Let's go from here.
Listen,
Dear,
Didn't you think before complaining?
Hey
How dare you?
If you stay here, unnecessary conflict may happen!
(You're the one who instigated him)
Why are you yelling at me,sister?
Hey,stop there
Hey,wait!
Why are you behaving like a rowdy?
Leave me,Sister. I will bash him.
You are a coward
I would've confronted you that day itself
but my uncle advised involving the police.
Hey,stop there!
Stop
Who authorized you to withdraw the case?
You should have consulted me.
(How can my uncle restore his lost respect?)
(This trouble has arisen solely because of you)
(Please don't instigate him anymore.)
There is a vacant flat in my apartment
You can shift and come there.
You will be at peace.
I'll speak to the landlord immediately
Please drink some water.
(Ask the person upstairs to come down)
Please leave this place,
Brother,
Eshwar,No. Please stop
See,he's coming down on his own
Hey
Why are you staring?
Wait and see
Buddy, one moment!
Leave them Eshwar!
Hey please come here!
Shanmugam, please go!
Brother please stop!
Hey, Stop.
Hey who are you?
what?
what?
(Go away)
Please never address me as your brother.
Sir, This doesn't seem right.
Sir, How can we be sure he won't repeat this?
I felt something was off with him since that day.
Sir,You guys are just talking as you please.
In this area, when people go for walks,
Can I talk about it?
(If someone is quiet)
(don't talk unnecessarily)
wait!
Brother, I don't know if you are at fault
Vacate the house immediately.
Eshwar
Listen to me,
Fine
Come!
Eshwar
Eshwar
Eshwar (shouting)
Yes
Yes
Please fix your shirt button.
Eshwar
We will park our car outside.
Please!
(Please finish your meal)
No
(I need some alone time)
Sir,
What I did was a mistake.
No matter what,
I shouldn't have involved my daughter in this.
Without considering my age
he physically confronted me.That's why,
The issue is between him and me
I have no problem with you.
I'm advising you for your well-being
please move out of here and find happiness elsewhere.
no one will find peace.
(Only two people can stand here)
(the rest,please wait outside)
(Please move)
Chidambaram!
Sir,
It will only be restored after 4 pm.
-You can leave. -Ok. Sir,
Sir,
Yes,
Someone has come to meet you.
I'm busy. Later,
He wants to talk to you about something important
-Ok. Let him in -Ok,Sir.
(Sir,You may come)
Sir, Here he is.
Wait outside until I call
Ok, Sir.
Shut the door and leave.
ok, Sir.
No idea.
What's  the matter?
What brings you here?
You want to start any issue again?
No,
Listen,
I don't care if I'm in the office
Please go away now.
I'm not here to cause problems, Sir
It's been four days..
Since I slept!
You did so much to me,
I should pay it back, right?
Are you threatening me?
Huh?
This is a government office..
Do you think you can escape trouble after messing with an officer?
Ok,Sir.
I'll leave now.
Chidambaram
Sir,
Get me a juice.
Ok, Sir.
Ashok, don't let the public in
Even I couldn't understand?
Everyone, please leave and cooperate
Rajesh, immediately check the surroundings including the vehicles,
Venkatesh, search the entire place!
Welcome mam,
Please.
Arun! - Mam,
Yeah it's fine!
Come on!
Lift your hands,
Yeah madam.
Please turn on the ceiling fan.
Within sometime the power may come.
Hey Chidambaram! - Sir

It's fine wait!
You go, - Okay sir,
Arun!
Check this area!
Yeah mam.
I'm not going anywhere.Madam, I'm thirsty and getting water
Okay,drink
Madam, everything is clear!
I checked them thoroughly.
Mam, everything is clear here.
I think it's a wrong information,
Sorry sir.
It's okay, madam. You just did your job.
Anyways, thanks for the cooperation sir, - It's alright!
They thought he will get bribe!
Thank god, the power came!
Sir, the power came!
Aye... Aye
(Sir,next year I'm retiring and I have a family)
Get in!
"In EO Mr. Ilamparuthi's room at Kundrathur Panchayat office"
"Mr. Ilamparuthi has been temporarily suspended by the officials"
They have suspended for accepting a bribe!
Where were you?
I called Balaji!
Where did you go?
Tell me,
Where were you?
I have a doubt,
did you do all of this?
Tell me the truth!
Did you do this?
Yeah
Are you a heartless creature?
Leave him!
Have you ever considered his family
They have a daughter at marital age.
What are you asking me to think about?
That's exactly why I want to move out of here.
I'll stay here no matter what happens.
We have to take a necessary action,
You're temporarily suspended!
That's my house there!
For check-up.
You could've woken me up, right?
No need,
Aathi...
Please cancel the cab, I'll take you.
Fine, I'm sorry.
Fine?
Could you please say something?
Aathi...
Doctor? - Thank god!
There's no internal damage, both are fine. - Okay
You can bring her home when she's feeling better.
- Hmm
Hello!
Sir, we're from Maruti service.
No, why?
Maybe, during a puncture someone would have loosened the bolts..
and didn't tighten them properly.
After repairing the damages,
Eshwar
Eshwar
Stop it!
Brother, please give us the bat.
What are you doing?
Hey, stop it! Don't do that!
Hey! it's a new car.Don't damage it !
Why are you damaging the car?
Hey, I just broke the car,
What?
Fortunately, my wife and I were saved
Eshwar,
You heartless creature.
Eshwar!
The anger I feel at this moment...
I'll just burn you alive!
You'll burn me alive?
Aye, leave.
Wait, I'll make you sit in your underwear again
Hello!
Are you trying to call the police?
Aye, give me back my phone.
This time, Are you going to accuse him of harassing me?
You went so far as to attempt murder Don't you feel ashamed?
She's pregnant, for God's sake! - Fine!
It's all because of her.
Would he still be here, shouting at me?"
Weren't you sorry for using me to file a complaint?
You suddenly started opposing me. - Stop it!
First, you failed as a husband,
Then as a father,
But now, you failed as a human being.
Failure?
All these years, I sacrificed..
You never lived for us!
You used your daughter to boost your ego and you are capable of doing anything.
Even, I'll kill you. - Dad, please leave her.
Leave me! - Leave her dad.
Your house?
Dad, why do you treat us like outsiders?
Hey, what's in this person's house for us?
Come, let's leave.
Go!
I'll go somewhere else, But I won't stay here.
Aathi
Listen - Don't touch me.
But you didn't even bother.
Because of your ego, if something bad happened to me and the baby?
Aathika...
Stay calm, - Get out!
Leave me alone...leave me alone.
Why are you yelling?
Don't strain yourself Aathika! - Get out!
Please listen to me Aathika! I get angry just seeing your face
Aathika...
This is a nice community, buddy!
The rent is a bit high, though.
Balaji!
I just need peace.
Already I have suffered a lot
Because of me, She's under unnecessary pressure.
Leave that!
You just start the shifting process!
All the amenities are available here,ok?
Is there any bar, nearby?
I need to talk to you!
I have found an another house.
In two days,
Fine!
But,
I've tried my best to control myself,
But only to a certain extent.
If it's crossed,
I'll go to any extreme.
But,
Enough!
We will finish it once and for all.
In my life,
We should never meet again!
I shouldn't get any trouble from you.
If you attempt to cause trouble.
What will you do?
Pretending to be good and attempting peace talks?
So what if I'm old?
Die, you scoundrel!
Eshwar!
Are you there?
Hey Eshwar!
Are you there?
Come...Come fast!
I couldn't endure the pain.
I fell down Eshwar!
I couldn't breathe...
The water has broken already
Eshwar, do you hear me?
Eshwar!
Sir...
He is just living his life!
Please leave me!
Hey,Hey,Please!
Please listen to me,
No,Don't hit me!
Aathika...
Aathika
Aathikk...
Huh?
Aathika, Aathika...
Arthikk...
Hey!
Hey, please stop.

Hey! Aye...aye!
Brother!

-Hello! -Hello!
Aathikk.. Aathika!
Hospital, huh? - Yeah
What happened to her?
What?
What is your relationship to the patient?
I'm her husband!
Husband? why are you so careless, sir?
The person who admitted her is also missing.
Who brought her in?
The patient's father admitted her.
Father?
Yes sir!
What is your relationship with the patient?

His name...is Ilamparuthi,sir !!

Sir?
Sir...sir!
Sir!
I'm sorry sir!
For everything!
My ego didn't leave,
I'm begging you, Please leave from here.
You have beaten him to death.
You could have managed your anger, right?
Selvi!
What age could he possibly be, 28?
It wouldn't have gone this far.
I could've adjusted a little!
I'm sorry brother!
Sir! - Hmm
Thank you for helping my wife
♫One day, it'll be together,
Please come!
This is the house!

Great ! If it's a bike, you can even park two
Yeah fine. - Please.

You do you.
Over there, big boy.
Ladies like dumplings?
Pete, meet my sister.
This is Pete, Claudia's brother.
And Ben.

This is Ben.
We all grew up together.
Yeah.
Yeah, we met.
Wow, that's so random.
Door's that way if you're looking to sneak out.
I know that's your thing.
Yeah.
So you a lawyer yet?
Why?
I'm just curious how you passed the class on ethics
I think that's the jerk who B got with when she was
No way.
I thought she looked familiar, but I don't see faces.
I just see souls.
I'm engaged now.
Good for you.
Where are you registered?
I'll buy you a broomstick.
You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?
You do remember.
See, it did mean something to you.
You'll always be my rock bottom.
The night I spent with a bitch.
You think they're going to physically fight?
That's a fine line.
Let's just get through tonight for them, OK?
Elle, she's your sister.
She's your friend.
I question why they're even together.
seeing you again.
joining together in holy matrimony,
I have an objection.
Leo, don't do this.
I have to, Annie.
It's just not right.
to celebrate in Australia.
2K to the front.
Thank you, Sheryl.
16 hours.
Don't think there's thousands of flights
flying to Sydney every day.
Serendipity, I guess.
So where's your fiance?
Wait, is this him?
Hey, I'm Ben.
What?
Oh my god, I forgot.
Claude told me you dumped him.
It's a pretty long flight.
Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?
No, thank you.
I'm all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.
See you there.

One answer to that problem, many of us
are leading lives that are misaligned
Thank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain.
What psychology can teach us about living
our most authentic lives?
Thanks for picking me up, dude.
Not just you, my guy.
Spelling Bee!
Hey!
Our sisters are getting married.
How dope is that?
Oh, great.
Bye.
Y'all ready for Australia?
Yep, my stepdad's house.
Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.
You don't even play tennis.
I know, but I feel sweet.
All over.
All over.
Spin, spin, spin.
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, he was there.
You're right.
This place is insane.
Don't need an invitation for that.
You can't leave me alone.
Same reason I slowed down at the car crash.
Okay, so you guys buried the hatchet,
water under the bridge, two adults adulting
like fucking adults.
There's only one bed,
She's kidding.
Wait for me!
She could use some spontaneity.
I have a million contingencies
Yeah.
Margaret, Margaret, look who's here.
Babe!
I wanted to message you,
but I didn't know how you'd feel about hearing from me.
Are you kidding?
Never leave.
They're good.
You know, mom now thinks she's Australian
Well, you know, everybody thought
You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress
Hallie, stop.
That's not me anymore.
I'm free now.
I'm deprogrammed.
That does not mean I don't support you
That's sweet.
That's Claudia's cousin.
No biggie.
Broke up with him.
Crushed his heart.
Hi, mate.
Like, tennis partner?
Hey, we're gonna go trotting this weekend.
Hit up the turps out here, eh?
Woo!
Yeah.
Hey, Beatrice.
Oh, baby.
Hi, baby.
Hi, honey.
Oh, my God.
Great.
Great.
How's the trip been?
Oh, magical.
The Australians are all wonderful.
And excuse me, but good looking.
I'm doing great.
Could have been you.
Have you heard from Jonathan?
Did he call or anything?
of our family anymore.
from like 11 years old.
He was basically family.
Was about to be actual family.
I'm very happy, but not when you guys do this.
Just think on it, yeah?
Yeah.
Ben, all set for dinner, yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
Hey!
Hi Ben!
Hey Ben!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody?
Dad's speech.
Oh yes, right, okay.
and Carol and I are so appreciative.
Biggest thing we've missed since coming back
before the wedding on Sunday.
Well, we're just so grateful,
not only for your incredible hospitality,
but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.
Now baby.
What does Jonathan say?
He knows you pretty well.
What does he think you should do?
Mom.
Okay.
she stowed away in the trunk.
I know that now, it was nice.
All right, everyone.
Crown chakra.
Okay.
Go!
Sign of the times.
All right, all right, four words.
First word, the, A, of, if.
Animosity, hate, liar.
Five words.
No, just shut the fuck up.
The Bible.
Just say the word.
It's on the extreme.
Grumpy old man.
Hi.
Hi.
Old cat woman.
No one cares, no one can see us.
Cheaters are shocking.
Says the woman who cheated on her fiance.
We were on a break, asshole.
Roger, what is this?
Fat, five.
Hey.
Just stop.
Stop.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Sam, what the?
Oh my God.
Get back.
Sam.
Roger.
I've got this.
Sorry.
It's true.
and our memories, which we are going to have
to stand there and profess our love.
Am I accurate?
and shove 'em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.
We return them to the night they were spent.
He didn't say anything about love, honey.
Yeah, come on!
That was good, right?
That was good.
She clearly has eyes for men.
Who does, father?
Hallie Spence, the sister.
The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.
You can't say that.
What the hell?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, that was rude.
I apologize to anyone that was listening,
which can only be you, Pete,
I apologize.
What the hell?
I don't know, I'm not good at this, sorry.
Tell me more, son.
Why me?
You can do it.
Why me, why?
so he lets his guard down and goes to her.
Some Cupid's killed with arrows and some with traps.
So, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers,
and say, "Come to Papa."
And your generation sucks.
You fucked up the whole world for us.
And I'm full of shame.
Well, because he likes her.
She's just denying herself because she's got in her head
Whoa, I'm not talking about love, baby.
I'm talking about dick.
Oh.
What?
Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia
It was Pete and Roger.
Fantastic, it's a team effort.
They're trying to get us together.
No way.
Come here.
Us?
There is no us and assholes.
Yeah.
I swear, if his head wasn't screwed on,
Both of us.
Doesn't seem like it.
Yeah.
I know.
Me too.
Can you not swim?
I'm fine.
Are your eyes closed?
I think it's dark.
I'm not out of shape.
I've been to 295, 300 once.
I just don't do cardio.
I'm not hot girl fit.
Wait, wait, wait.
Thanks.
No fucking way.
Honey, look who's here.
I cannot believe they did this.
Who is that?
Hey, hey.
My Black Hawk helicopter parents
for the past four months.
That's my parents.
They think I'm throwing my life away.
Just tell everyone we're together.
What?
and that problem for you.
You clearly want Margaret.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
and I know she broke your heart.
She sees you're with me.
We're not in seventh grade.
Trust me, bro.
Let's just embrace it.
There's no way we can convince anyone
we actually like each other.
I know.
You know, I still think about that night we spent together.
Shut up.
Let's do it.
Just wait.
Okay, okay.
We're running behind schedule.
Wait, wait, wait.
A few more minutes isn't gonna hurt them.
Thank you.
But I am hurting cats right now
and I need some help
Aw, jitters.
Remember our wedding?
on God's green earth.
Hey.
Jonathan.
So nice to see you.
So your parents didn't tell you, okay?
And now it is fucking awkward.
No, no, not at all.
No, you're like family.
I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, congratulations.
Yeah, thanks.
It's great to see you too.
so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out.
Let's move out.
Oh, hey, man.
I'm Ben.
Hey, oh, Pete and Claudia's friend, right?
Yeah, you are so terrible at this.
What?
Honey, I'm sorry.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, no, Mom, guys, no.
Have fun.
You told them five seconds ago.
You've been with one guy your entire life.
Okay.
so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.
Let's just be affectionate.
I'll affectionate the shit out of you.
I can't believe your parents invited Jonathan.
What about Bea?
Wow.
Check it out, guys!
Nice!
Yeah!
Beautiful!
Man, that's nice.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
Feel the serenity.
Alright, your turn.
Wow.
This is just so romantic.
Get in there.
Damn, you are short.
You are not tall enough to say that.
Oh.
Oh, are you ticklish?
Beg me.
Just let me do it.
Too hard.
Sorry.
You gotta sell it.
Okay, not in circles.
It's not a magic lamp.
What?
It's a swimsuit.
I'm on holiday.
Okay, just mind the gap.
How's that?
That's good.
How's that gonna convince?
Oh, on you.
I can't.
How'd you get in this thing?
Oh, man, it's tight.
No.
Really? 'Cause I feel something.
I don't have a mole.
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Jack, spiders hunt bears.
They hunt bears.
No pictures.
Put the cameras down.
I think I see something.
You're fine.
Yeah.
We do not inherit the earth.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.
When you know she's the one, nothing else matters.
Yeah.
No, I didn't.
They're holding hands.
I think it's working.
I can't believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.
What?
The story about the giant wrench.
Good friend.
Fancy a game?
You're going down.
Pretty good.
You?
Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?
You know me.
I've never been one for practicing.
Still having second thoughts?
Straight to third.
Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.
That's sweet.
You're part of the family.
Yeah, me too.
How long have you and that guy, Ben, been?
Well, I think he seems great.
Thanks for being so cool about all of this.
Okay.
so I don't think I can.
She's a little sweet on you, hey?
Oh, you caught that.
Nah, we're just banging about.
More romantic.
Wow.
Bea's a lucky girl.
Oh.
Margaret thinks we're together.
That's great.
No, Margaret needs to think
'Cause if she thinks we're together together,
she's not gonna break girl code.
and she can just slide right in
so that we can be together.
No, it's like coffee here.
It's like meth.
I'm guessing.
No, I'm not.
I worked at Goldman.
Jesus, dude, who are you?
You got a painting?
That is not Gaga.
Actually, that could be construed as Gaga.
And I'm into you,
Fuck it up.
Ooh.
He did it, yeah.
All right, everybody, wheels up.
Hustle up.
Bad dog.
You look cute.
Baby, you look so good.
She's has been.
You look so good.
Yeah, I look bad.
Man, this is the best time to say that.
Daddy's a dad.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, guys.
Woo!
Nice dress.
You look fine.
What's a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?
Three scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.
All right.
You remembered.
That was a fun summer.
Oh, okay, I'm coming.
Hang on, I've got heels on.
with no real transportation or reason.
Okay.
And look at you, Polly Pocket.
The first or second time?
Well, that might be a problem, mate.
They might not wanna shag a brother.
Can parents back off a little?
Can you even dance?
You just let me lead.
Is Margaret watching?
Everybody to the top deck,
I'm with you.
So what are we doing?
What?
Grab some drinks.
Oh, great.
Nice.
Exactly.
so they're totally comfortable in their mutual lameness.
Toast me.
Oh my God.
Come on.
So is saying cringe, old man.
Have you?
Aww!
Can't imagine they would.
We can stop there.
Wait!
Yeah.
We'll run aground.
Come on.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I couldn't even tell him I quit law school.
I don't think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.
Landmarks like those are full of people in love.
Thanks again.
Want some coffee?
Well, that's the best kind.
I can't hear you.
Steve!
Beatrice!
Beatrice!
Now Bae's waxing her other hand.
Whoo!
Keep it to yourselves.
- You quit school?  - What?
Mom, this isn't about you.
It's called life.
in order for peace to prevail across the land.
You fucked it up.
than with me.
Well, you've been more concerned about your planning.
Well, if that's how you feel,
Love is intoxicating.
It envelops you, it tickles you,
It's like this wind.
Is that Tasmania?
Yeah.
Good luck.
Good luck.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, we'll go with you.
No, we won't.
No.
So...
Yeah.
I might go and do some people watching.
these people.
I'm so sorry.
Same with Ben.
You're so clever.
You know her name is Bea.
We did.
but I meant what I said up there about love.
No, I didn't kiss Margaret.
Margaret kissed me. I backed up.
Stop it.
You gorgeous idiot.
Run. Don't wait on love.
Honey, no one's 29.
Oh, wait.
Please ask a favor!
stick your hands down my pants.
really fucking suck.
That's a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.
Yeah, I'm dying. I need some air.
because of all of our bullshit.
- What?  - What?
so you guys would feel bad and make up.
Are you marrying your precious itinerary or me?
Well, if that's how you feel,
[Bhairji's voice over] All the villagers started worshiping
Naik, I wonder...
Oh...
Have met but rarely...
Yesajirao, Tanhajirao, Baji Jedhe and many more.
What are these people like?
What I say...
Oh listen...
Let's talk about Tanhajirao...
Tanhajirao had left for Pune to meet King Shivaji.
Okay...
"As King Shivba is rising as the Sun"
"As King Shivba is rising as the Sun"
"Oh our King!"
"As Shivba is rising as the Sun"
"Your arrival has blessed the mother earth"
"The Sahyadris have woken up!"
"Our King is like a lion"
"This Marathas have carved it out of black soil"
"Shivaji Raje is the support of every farmer"
"King Shivba is the real warrior"
"As we pray to Bhairoba, Khandoba and Jyotiba..."
"King Shivba is the real warrior"
"As we pray to Bhairoba, Khandoba and Jyotiba..."
"Hail Lord Khandoba!"
"Hail Lord Jyotiba!"
"Oh my King!"
"God has arrived"
"You have carved its fortune"
"You are our kind and caring King!"
"We would lay our lives on your feet."
"We will stay with you in all the battles"
"Bless him Goddess Ambabai!"
"May Shivraya be victorious."
"As Shivba is rising as the Sun"
What is this?
My King...
My King...
But you saved it and rebuilt it to a beautiful heaven.
possessed by Sultan by now.
When will all of this stop?
Have we lost our rage, self respect, courage... everything?
In such times,
you came as if Lord Shiva came to our rescue.
Yes, he is right.
Now, after a long period, we can celebrate our festivals.
Yes.
We offer first portion of our harvest to the God.
Oh our divine King...
"As Shivba is rising as the Sun"
Come my King, let me show you the original idol.
Come...
Please come...
First comes Jagdamba Goddess of Tuljapur.
Then Bhavani Mata Temple of Kavlapur.
Yes, Indeed.
Once, there was a war between Aadilshahi and Nizamshahi forces...
in this area over Kondhana Fort.
All the soldiers started entering the temple.
But our priest is very clever.
So this Idol is saved.
Let's go.
My King...
[Bhairji's voice over] Yet, Even Gods were afraid of Sultans.
gathered his friends from village to village.
[Bhairji's voice over] King Shivaji was upset
He hid it under the grass.
came from Umrath Village and met him.
My King...!
They are saluting.
My King...!
What... this?
That...
While climbing the ambush the bear attacked.
"Here he comes... Here he comes..."
"Here he comes... Here he comes..."
"King Shivaji's friend"
Be careful!
"Here he comes... Here he comes..."
"Here he comes... Here he comes..."
"King Shivaji's friend"
"He is the fierce warrior"
Show me the wound.
Uh...
Go... show...
Sarjerao!
Call Krishna here.
Yes.
Yes. Gajaa...
Yes.
What is this Tanhajirao?
Salute My King!
Have a look at him.
That is our Shelar mama.
Salute My King!
And standing over there is my younger brother.
He is called Suryaji.
What do you feel?
I feel like wielding a sword.
I feel like fighting the war.
I feel like I should flaunt my wounds from the war.
Hmm...
To Pune?
Yes.
Yes. Let's go!
But then...
what about your farm chores?
Uh...
He can outdo ten people at once.
He is a tiger!
Okay!
He is the great Baji kaka Pasalkar.
Come.
"You are like Goddess Bhavani"
"You rule Maval province"
"You live in holy city of Pune"
"Bless us for nation building"
"Enemies fear you"
"Your memory is sacred"
"Your vision is divine"
"Your vision is divine" [Shelar] Sit girl... sit.
Baji kaka,
Our people in other village suspected them.
They followed them.
My child!
You tell me what happened?
Say something yourself.
You Demons!
How dare you?
Pardon my insolence your highness...
But I had bought this girl
for twenty-five dinars from the market.
And remember...
we also have the permit of Bijapur court.
No one from here...
can interfere in our trade matters.
Is it your business to sell innocent girls?
What will you do?
[Crowd] Hey...!
"You are the deliverance from sin"
"You kill the wicked"
"You gave women the boon of security"
"When Jija Mauli (Mother) looks furious"
Go...!
Go and tell your Sultan...
She won't tolerate this kind of sin.
Come on!
Keep walking.
Keep walking.
Keep walking.
Stop crying my child.
Make all the arrangements for them.
Go.
Tanhajirao's prowess of a bear had gone upto Aausaheb (Queen Mother).
Did Tanhajirao defeat that bear?
Well Done!
If the bear had been caught,
Don't be awkward.
You are a brave man.
Yes, of course!
Such as command.
Let's go everyone.
Come.
Jedhe, tell me one thing.
"we own our land"
He is Baji Yashwantrao Pasalkar.
He is the legend Baji kaka Pasalkar.
Let's go...
are waiting for you in the arsenal.
and stood behind King Shivaji firmly.
Lord Ganesha!
Lord Hanuman!
Rao...
Salute to the King!
Please come in.
Come in please.
Oh my!
What?
What a wonder!
My King...
Yes?
I wish to demonstrate some stances.
Come to the arena.
"King Shivaji's friend"
Very Good...
You are a tiger!
Janojirao!
Yes my King...
Very courageous!
My King,
This is the 'Hanumanti stance'.
What a Move...
combination of 'Musalmani stance' and 'Karnataki stance'.
"His arms are as strong as Lord Hanuman"
Very good Rao... very good.
the stance which you practiced
I don't know much about that, My King.
But in our village everyone practices the same stance.
Tanhajirao,
Yes My King!
Then I am giving you both of these swords.
But not as a prize.
My King,
Let one of my swords be here in armory.
And tie the other one to my waist
with your own hands.
Budhaji!
Tanhajirao!
Yes.
Yes.
Now you tell me...
what does this mean?
Well, Malusare...
and stand firmly behind King Shivaji.
For the last ten generations we have shed our blood for these Sultans...
No matter how much we do...
he destroys all of our household.
Yes.
Make up your mind.
Let your weapon...
Devote yourself to King Shivaji.
Yes Baji Kaka...
Yes.
That night, they killed her brother and kidnapped her.
Nothing was left to keep the body alive.
Jagadamb...
When I went to console her with love...
she pushed me away and said...
Father...
Huh?
I am no longer sanctified enough to embrace me.
I must atone.
This grief is not yours alone, child...
many young girls are falling prey to this sin...
being crushed by this tyranny.
You have fulfilled your duty in this world.
Now, this body must be discarded.
This must now be dissolved.
Her face was very calm
You brought justice to the girl before she died.
Let me help...
Come baba...
When will all this end?
When our sisters and mothers will live fearlessly...
My Soldiers...
Are you all with me?
Yes my King...
Aausaheb...(Queen mother)!
to keep this land free and independent.
Hail Goddess Bhavani!
Hail Goddess Bhavani!
[Bhairji's voice over] Tanhajirao joined the thunderous campaign...
Then king initiated the campaign in the Konkan region.
On this mission,
all the roads.
[Vishwas] Why?
Due to this,
the king Shivaji had sent Pilaji Nilkanthrao Sarnaik
[Tanhajirao] Once you finish building this road,
[Tanhajirao] start excavating this road.
[Tanhajirao] And build some stairs here.
Hey Tanhaji...
I am coming Mama.
Pilajiro...
Come...
have some bread.
No.
Why? What happened?
All of this.
Clash of shields and swords...
The sound of cannons...
The clatter of road construction equipments...
But I want to fight war...
Pilajirao... careful...
The king Shivaji who has given swords in our hands...
has also given these road construction equipments...
King Shivaji thinks far beyond horses, swords and forts.
We must take swords in our hand and also a construction tools.
For whom?
We should farm our lands as well as construct the forts.
And who are these people?
We, ourselves.
Our King endures so much hardship for us...
Tanhajirao,
Once the war strikes,
your words won't work.
Tanhajirao!
Hurry up...
Pilajirao... Go and help Suryaji...
Hey... throw that spear...
Mama... you take care of this front...
I will go and check Suryaji Pilaji's side...
Yes... go ahead...
Hey...
Hey wait... where are you running?
Hey wait...
Hey, get up!
Get up.
Captain...
Leave me.
No... listen...!
Nilkanth Rao Sarnaik... right?
Yes... Yes...
What will he say when he sees your cowardice from heaven...
Nothing... Nothing...
King Shivaji gave you such an honour...
What should I do with you?
Captain...
Hold this in your hand.
Don't you dare leave it.
Captain...
Captain
Captain
Please let me go.
Um... means?
Pilajirao, now learn properly.
As if tied tightly.
Not even a single step backward. Understood?
Captain...!
Please let me go.
Now run...
Hey...
Captain...
Stop running you cowards...
Come fight...
Hail Lord- Mahadeva!
Hail Lord- Mahadeva!
don't just use your words.
Use the weapon as well.
And then?
That means Talkokan's campaign was successful for Swarajya (Self Rule)
He befriended the people of Konkan.
My King,
you were saying something about building a navy...
Later.
Tanhajirao has proved that he can not only wield a sword,
but can strategize the mission with precision and accuracy.
My King...?
No, no... I made the mistake.
What happened Tanha?
I haven't done anything, Mama.
My king?
Gunaji...
Tanhajirao...
I myself tied this sword to your waist.
Now tell me,
What does this mean?
That means you won't just remain a Captain anymore.
Today onwards, you will be Subhedar (Commander-in-chief).
Commander Tanhajirao Malusare.
Great...!
My King...!
Naik, right after this campaign our King went to Agra?
Yes.
Come on... Hurry up.
One such night, when we were hungry,
we stopped by a hut in a village.
Is anyone there inside?
Yes I am...
I am Jana Garadin.
Mother...
Uh...
We have been on a long journey,
and we are very hungry now.
Can we...
get something to eat?
Something to eat?
Uh... Yes.
There are millets at home.
Is it?
Then come inside.
Uh... Yes.
Come on in.
Come.
Come, my children. Sit down.
Come.
Oh...
Oh... you seem like King Shivaji.
He has started ruling the province.
So that our people will stay protected...
Oh god!
Huh?
Why are you crying?
Mother,
you are serving him with so much love.
Aausaheb...(Queen Mother). Huh...
Yes?
Nothing...
waiting for Sivba to come home.
I feel I would see a troop of horse riders coming this way.
And my...
my Sivba and
But no...
only an unobstructed sky is visible.
What brings you here?
Call them in the courtyard.
What if they are tricksters?
Even if it is so,
These Sages have nothing to do with politics...
They are worshipers of God.
And in such difficult situation their blessings are,
valuable to us.
And even if they are deceivers or betrayers,
Let's go...
Budhaji...
Call them in the court.
Come on.
Welcome...
Mother, we have arrived from Mathura.
We were passing by the Rajgad so we thought...
Since then,
he is getting ill.
My child...
Sivba!
Sivba...!
Sivba came...
Sivba.
Sivba.
Sivba.
While the campaign to lower Konkan was going on,
The King gave Hiroji Indalkar the task of building Sindhudurg fort.
The King went to Agra.
By then the King had returned.
Indalkar!
Attack can be done from here!
Indalkar!
Indalkar!
Malusare!
Moropant himself?
this letter for you.
For me? Yes!
'Sakal Laxmi Alankrut' (Honourable)
To Hiroji Indalkar,
Head of the Construction department.
Many well wishes from King Shivaji.
I escaped from Mughal captivity and asked...
The answer brought tears to my eyes.
As soon as everything is stable here,
and observe the work of the fort.
May the dignity of self rule shine.
Waah!
Subhedar (Commander),
you told this to our king right?
But let me tell you Indalkar...
Subhedar! (Commander)
Commander. [Tanhajirao] Indalkar.
Take this.
I must leave.
I must finish all the task before King comes.
Why did he leave so suddenly, muttering to himself?
Once he finishes all his work before the King's arrival,
Once, he hands over the fully constructed fort to the King,
Indalkar will leave from Malvan.
Once the given task is completed, he will hand it over selflessly to the King.
Well done Indalkar!
Well done!
Why have you brought me here?
Listen Janai...
Me?
See...
Moropant is here.
Moropant, please tell her why she is here.
Hey, you...
Janai...
Let the king arrive. He will tell you everything.
Yes.
What?
Yes.
But what have I done?
That means, you are...
Yes.
Please forgive me. I spoke wrongly with you.
Why?
What happened?
The other day,
So what?
Is he mine alone?
He is your son too.
Isn't he?
Mother...
And then go.
Yesaji...!
Janai,
Yes?
Yes.
Sivba,
The army should be refreshed.
Eighteen factories, Twelve Palaces,
Hmm...
to win the fortresses given to the enemy.
Because It is situated exactly opposite to Rajgad.
That's why, King Shivaji would capture Kondhana first.
We have to appoint a sharp,
Achal Singh...
Kubaad Khan...
Go through all the villages around Kondhana fort,
and make announcements in all those villages.
Like this,
[Announcement] Pay attention everyone!
[Announcement] Pay attention everyone!
If anyone tries to go beyond the border and the mountain...
then he will be considered as King Shivaji's spy,
and he will be beheaded.
[Announcement] Pay attention everyone!
Hey...
Hey...
Stop running...
Stop...
Stop... stop...
Where are you running...?
Got you...
My King...!
My King...!
What Happeend?
My whole family was killed.
Well done Majesty!
Let me go...
[Navlaji] Spare us your Majesty...
But what if your son is King Shivaji's spy?
I begged him a lot...
Kubaad Khan!
Starve the kid for three days.
I was not able to save my wife...
You...
Don't touch her with your impure hands.
She begged a lot.
My Lord Shiva!
Take care...
Take care of yourself...
Sarjerao!
Yes.
Come.
flutters like thorn in my eyes.
The people there need protection.
For the safety of our people,
we must conquer strong forts like Kondhana, Sivba.
If I don't conquer fort Kondhana within the next month,
Because Kondhana fort is,
It has three sides.
One side descends to the Karyat Maval,
second descends to the Khede Bara,
and third descends towards Gunjan Maval.
The one who has control over Kondhana rules the Maval province.
Hello...
Raiba!
Go see what are those guest saying.
Yes.
Tanhajirao's child.
Commander Tanhaji... is he home?
Commander Tanhaji...
This trader has came far from the north.
Somewhere from Agra.
Agra... Agra
Oh... yes!
Yes...
My son...
has borrowed some money from poor trader.
Poor trader...
They are saying that,
ask her whatever you want to.
Yes.
Come fast, Savitri.
What should we repay you?
Sister-in-law!
Oh!
Yes.
Yes, it's us!
What's the matter?
Uh... mother-in-law!
I know these people.
My husband said,
But this man said,
Uh...
Did I say so?
No...
Give you back...
Agra...!
No problem...
Yes!
Freshen up and come inside.
Go... Help her.
Had your lunch, Son?
Keep.
You go and check if mother-in-law needs something!
I will look after the guests.
Sister-in-law, you wait here only.
My brother-in-law...
Oh Suryajirao!
Yes.
Oh, okay...! [Bahirji] okay...
Please have the food!
Yes! [Bahirji] yes...
Listen... Can I?
Remove it. How can you eat with that?
Yes, exactly!
But brother-in-law,
but first you tell me, Sister-In-law,
But I still don't know your names.
Hmm...
Younger sister-in-law!
Yes...
Yes!
Yes... he must be done!
But sister-in-law!
No need to appreciate...
After being with commander for so many years,
But tell me.
We have planned our Raiba's wedding.
Oh, really... very good.
Yes!
But exactly where?
To offer prayers to God Khandoba.
And then the Rajgad fort.
To take blessings of King Shivaji and Aausaheb (Queen Mother).
They are also like Gods for us.
Sister-in-law!
Yes?
But why?
Yes my King...
Yes!
This time I will lead the mission.
Yes!
I will easily conquer the fort and offer at your feet.
I have complete faith in your valour.
Let's go.
Can you show Gurj Weapon to me.
Mama...!
It seems everyone here is preparing for some battle.
Yes!
Yes!
But...
Why are you still hesitating?
It's difficult to find brave people like you.
But...
Or Murarbaji Deshpande?
Pant!
Once a precious gem is lost, It is lost forever.
Pant, you tell me...
Goddess Bhavani forbid...
if we assign Tanhajirao on this mission,
and something unfortunate happens.
God forbid!
Then where can I find a gem like Tanhaji Malusare?
Oh well...!
And that is why...
My King...
He has planned his son Raiba's wedding.
Do you treat your child like this?
I didn't mean that commander...
My King...
Put himself in fire?
Then what is our use?
Why should we be proud of this masculinity?
Tanhaji...!
He was not ready to listen unless he met the King himself.
I won't listen to anything.
The auspicious ceremony at my home
will not happen without conquering the Kondhana fort.
Yes!
But Tanhajirao... Raiba's wedding?
My King...
First lets conquer the Kondhana fort,
Hail Lord... Mahadeva!
Please come Tanha...
but why did you?
I... uh...
Yes.
How much longer are we going to lose golden people like you...
Now, you tell me.
Together, we will fight this battle...
Pardon me.
If I die you will meet hundreds of other Tanhajis like me.
Tanha... listen...
"After worshiping Ganesha"
"the sacred rituals of the bride began" [Savitri] Listen,
"the sacred rituals of the bride began"
"Lord Ganesha was worshiped first"
"Worshiped the beautiful Goddess Amba bai"
"We have began the auspicious work"
"All acquaintances are also here"
"These rituals bind everyone in a bond of love"
"Everyone celebrates these rituals with music"
No... I... am thirsty.
"We began the celebration"
"These rituals brings happiness"
"We know the rituals of duty towards King"
You have started hiding many things from me nowadays.
It's nothing...
So... uh...
Okay.
Or shall we postpone it?
Because... if we don't postpone it,
how shall the mission be accomplished?
Uh... about that...
is from this soil only.
Answer me...
Can I tell you the truth.
Then you women are the strongest fist
who holds the strength of the sword.
Don't make me cry now.
When are you leaving?
Please pay attention here!
Commander Udaybhan...
Please step outside of your houses.
then stop helping King Shivaji.
And accept the rule of the Sultan.
Hey!
And If anyone wants to says anything, I'll answer them with my own hands.
By strangling your neck.
Greetings!
Such a situation should happen.
God Vitthal's eagle?
Yes... yes.
Udaybhan has bent the steel guard...
This news has been spread in all villages.
Everyone is very scared.
They are extremely scared.
Yes...
Tell Naik...
Yes Sire.
Therefore I could see the perimeter of the fort.
Subhedar (Commander) Tanhajirao himself?
Who is that Udaybhan?
King Shivaji has more powerful warriors than him.
Until our King's saffron flag is protecting us,
Hail Goddess Bhavani!
[Crowd] Hail Goddess Bhavani!
Jiva...
Yes.
Rambhaji...
And blend in with the enemies.
Naik,
You all know Kondhana well since your childhood, right?
Yes...
Yes!
We need to know all those changes.
You are right!
That's why we made such a plan.
Are you getting my point?
Yes!
Let's go.
Greetings, brother!
Greetings...
Greetings... Greetings.
Are you the new recruits?
What's your name?
Hey, wait!
and he is...
Meva Singh!
Yes...
What now?
Yes!
And the locals believe that
A horde...
has been sent here?
Here...?
Yes!
Yes...
These ghosts from Deccan are very dangerous.
Beware of them.
Yes...
Who, me?
Ghost...! Where?
May the ghost never comes here.
Uhh...
Yes. Yes
Be careful...
It's me brother.
Let's be quick...
Come on...
Who is he?
Hey, hey listen.
Run faster... be quick...
There's a ghost...
Run... Run.
What are you looking at brother?
Ghost!
Down there...
Brother Arjan Singh...
The rumours on the fort are true.
Rumours are rife in our army.
Some soldiers are claiming to have seen ghosts.
I don't believe in such things.
But your Majesty,
If that's the case, Achal Singh!
You suggest,
What is the solution?
He saw this woman in the village,
she knows some occult things.
"Death is also afraid of her"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"Enemies tremble with fear at the sight of her"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"She gives a different spiritual experience"
"She cares for the King (Shivaji)"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"Death is also afraid of her"
"May Mari Aai bless us..."
This moron will get devastated.
Hey...!
What is she saying?
All of you are doomed.
What?
Goddess... please have some mercy.
This is not my curse.
This karma is going to torture him as a ghost.
Destruction is imminent.
Destruction is imminent.
Destruction is imminent.
Destruction is imminent.
Goddess, please give us the solution.
[Screaming] Mother got angry...
Ghost only will tell you the solution, not me.
Hey... wait.
Goddess... Hey... wait.
Hey, not you...
There are only four guards here.
Yes.
We can see many soldiers under the fort.
Now what's next, mother...?
Next...
See, it ran that way.
It ran that way.
Wait!
Mother... Wait!
The ghost exhausted them...
Look they are tired...
Hey... hey... hey.
Wait... wait.
But why?
Hey who are you?
You killed that little one, right?
You wait...!
You wait...!
Arise Oh Mother Goddess...!
Lord Mahadeva give us strength...!
Give us strength...!
Oh mother...
Give us strength Lord Mahadeva...!
Give us strength...!
You wait...! Wait...
Wait...!
Where will you go?
Now where will you go...?
Oh mother...
Keep quiet...
Nothing to worry now.
Now you won't perish...
Bless us Shree Eklingji.
Take it.
Get lost. Take it.
We must inform Naik.
We have leave from here first, to go and inform Naik.
He just keeps it on the throat.
Understood?
Break their bones...
but make them spill all the secrets,
torture them,
[Marathi Language] Idiots... making maps.
Hey!
No...
Leave him...
Leave him!
Saw the consequences of fighting the Mughals.
untie me,
what are the consequences of fighting with Marathas.
Hey!
Your Majesty,
The Marathas have attacked Kalyan gate.
They usually attack during the nights.
You are being summoned.
Hey, just shut up!
Why should I silent?
Tell me! Tell me...
Naik! Shush...!
Naik?
Take this.
Udaybhan took it...
Be careful.
Catch him...
Don't let him escape.
Catch that Spy.
Don't let him escape.
Catch that Spy.
Don't let him escape.
Move away...
Don't say such bad things.
What are saying sister?
I still remember that day.
I lost my husband in the war against the Mughals.
We were miserable and helpless.
Sister!
Sister!
Come with me to Umarth.
You have nothing left here after Kalojirao's death.
How can I leave my village Godavli?
Both of my sons, Tanhaji and Suryaji, were born here.
Now, how can I leave everything behind?
You are mistaken, sister.
You are entitled to Two houses.
You bring prosperity wherever you go like Goddess Laxmi does.
That might be true.
Why should I cause Inconvenience to your family.
You are my elder sister.
Come with me.
No I won't.
Listen!
You had forgotten this.
I didn't forget it.
I left it on purpose.
Why?
For you.
Yashoda!
or feel sad,
you should look upto your sister-in-law.
How does she manage everything with strength.
The way she supports our family.
Okay?
Okay!
Keep this.
Why is commander's wife crying?
Who is crying?
No.
I am crying.
But why?
I am still alive.
Say...!
I understand.
I must leave now.
Listen!
Please come back!
Soon...
Yes!
I must leave now.
Come safely.
Let's go, Mama! Yes.
Mother, I shall leave now!
Sister, I shall leave now!
My king...
Ramaji Dimble of Kalyan has come.
My king...
Sakojirao Shilimkar of Gunjan valley has come.
Sambhajirao Jedhe of Kari has come.
My king...
Very good!
Subhedar (Commander)...!
Yes?
In the fort...
Prepare Fifteen Hundred shields.
Prepare Fifteen Hundred swords.
Prepare Fifteen Hundred spears.
Prepare Fifteen Hundred daggers and pikes.
Your Majesty, so many weapons?
Yes!
They could be Two Thousand.
They could be Three Thousand.
They could be Five Thousand.
No need!
Then what mama?
Only Five Hundred soldiers?
But they all came from another province.
Who cares...!
Yes Subhedar (Commander).
I have faced him myself.
He is much feared in and around the fort.
He does not hesitate to behead people if necessary.
He is originally from Bhinay village in Rajputana.
From the time of his father, everyone worked for Aurangzeb.
But we will not fight in broad daylight.
Then?
Remember...!
So what happens,
In Sahyadri we cannot see far but nearer objects remain visible.
Put pot's of hot oil on Kalyan gate and Pune gate.
But, there is no fortification between Susati Tower and Kalavantin tower.
Your Majesty,
[Grunting] No... no!
Either air or death can come from here.
Who dares to do it?
We will go from there.
My king, we must climb from the Donagiri ridge.
How come?
Then I have Two men.
Ghorpade brothers.
They climb more difficult cliff than Donagiri ridge.
They will reach up and tie a rope to something.
After tying the rope, will you climb or not?
Yes! Yes!
Navlaji!
Come in! [Navalaji] Yes Master!
there will be little whispering.
We don't want that to happen.
We should find a place to hide somewhere around Six miles away.
I will tell you!
Yes, Master!
How far is Donagiri cliff from there?
There are many trails.
We can walk a little,
Maybe!
Then it is decided!
Yes! Yes!
My King,
And...
What happened, Tanhajirao?
Why did you stop?
That... uh...
I want a farewell lunch from you before we leave.
Go ahead!
I have been observing for the past few days.
You seem really upset.
I tried to talk to Mirzaraja.
Otherwise I will forget friendship and behead you right here.
I admit that I am praising King Shivaji,
And I am the most loyal servant of Alamgir Badshaha.
I have to prove my loyalty, Achal Singh.
Let's go.
Tanha,
Don't you like the menu?
Is it?
Soyrabai!
Take that "Laddos" plate.
Yes!
Have it!
Now sit down.
Goddess Jagdamba herself came to give food.
Have it!
My King,
Be careful.
It's the matter of Mighty Kondhana Fort.
must touch the steps of Kondhana fort.
Tanha!
Don't say such inauspicious things.
with all of you.
And if we will be together,
The entire Sahyadri,
Too many times,
But, before that,
don't forget that my nephew is getting married.
Please take care of yourself.
But, Tanhajirao!
come back...!
Even if I die in the battle,
Tanha!
"Shivba's Tanhaji left for the war"
"To fulfil his promise"
"They are praying to Goddess Bhavani"
"They are praying to Goddess Bhavani"
What happened?
My shoulder is dislocated.
Be careful. Go!
Surya, let's go...
"Seeing that, even the rocks were shocked"
"Even darkness trembles in fear of Tanhajirao"
Mama, Suryaji go ahead.
Come on [Whispering]...
Arjan Singh!
"In pursuit of Guerrilla warfare"
"To destroy the enemies sound sleep"
"Where does the "Mavala" Soldier come from?"
Kubaad Khan!
Charge...
"Udaybhan rushes into the battle"
Hey Udaybhan!
"He descended on the battlefield like a bolt of lightning"
My King...
Soon we will know what happens...
Your feet will hurt.
"The pain Intensified"
"The pain Intensified"
"I will kill Tanhaji now"
"I will kill Tanhaji now"
"Angry Udaybhan attacked"
Hey, Udaybhan!
even then our King Shivaji told him the same thing.
If you are invading as a Hindu ruler,
But if you have come here as a servant of Aurangzeb,
then you will have to face my sword.
He was here as a servant.
Have you forgotten the holy soil in which you were born?
Maharana Pratap,
Maharana Sangram Singh,
Maharana Ratansingh Rawal.
Mughal slaves like you will never understand this.
We Marathas stand tall as a fortification.
Before your dirty hands even touch the Swarajya (Self Rule),
we will cut them off.
Tanha...!
Tanha...!
My child...
Brother... Brother...
My child...
Suryaji!
Brother...
You are my tiger.
Don't turn around unless you conquer the fort.
Suryaji!
Suryaji, go!
But, brother...
If our soldiers scatter,
Bring... bring our soldiers back.
Go!
No...
Bring our soldiers back... go!
Hey, take him to the Amruteshwar temple.
I'll be there.
Yes!
Take care of yourself!
Hey... Help me...
Tanha...
Hey... Stop.
Stop... you cowards.
Stop...
Back off...
I'll slit your throat.
Where are you running away, cowards?
Your father is lying there, covered in blood.
Hey!
Step Down...
Now jump off the cliff and die,
Why did you climb this cliff?
To conquer the fort, right?
As he is wounded, your trouble is over...!
Are you running away...
No!
Look!
Look, over there...
Here come the enemies with swords...
Will enemy let you escape...?
Tell me!
Will they?
Shame on you!
But if you die as King's warrior,
Gather yourself and turn around...
Arise Soldiers...
Hail Lord Mahadeva!
Hail Lord Mahadeva!
Marathas have returned...
Run...!
Hail Lord Mahadeva!
Midnight has passed...
No news yet.!
My King...
Pant!
Pant we won... Kondhana Fort.
We won Kondhana fort...
We won.
Yes My King!
Tanhajirao?
Where is Tanhajirao?
My King...
My King...
Tanha...
Tanha...
Tanha...
Tanha...
Tanha...
I conquered the fort, my King.
Yes!
But now,
But now, my journey ends here.
No!
No, don't say that!
My King...
Yes!
Just one thing.
So,
Will you?
I am helpless.
My King...
Sanctified...!
My King...
No, Tanha...
Don't talk like this.
My King...
I'll be immortal now!
Like Lord Hanuman...
I'll be immortal...
No, let's call the Vaidya (doctor).
And you come with me to Rajgad fort.
Go and call Vaidya (Doctor)!
Why are you just watching...? Call the Vaidya (Doctor).
We conquered the fort Subhedar (Commander)...
And Tanha...?
It's okay!
What is this, sister-in-law?
Uncle Shelar said...
that we lost Three Hundred and Sixty soldiers on Sinhagad.
Theses lamps are made in their remembrance.
If they had not sacrificed their lives,
From today this ritual will be performed in every wedding of Malusare family.
Let it be...
Raiba!
Now tell me.
I myself tied this sword to your waist.
Now tell me,
Commander Tanhajirao Malusare.
Tanhajirao conquered Sinhagad but did not stay to see the ceremony.
They were rewarded with gold bracelets and robes of honour.
Tanhajirao showed how loyalty should be.
Suryaji showed how a brother should be.
Just like Lord Ram and Laxman,
Not to grieve, but to fight.
EMERGENCY SITUATION
Starring
-I don’t know where it is. -And you think I do?
Bad luck. Someone’s in there.
-I didn’t want to. -You only want to pee when you can’t.
It’s such poetry, isn’t it, Sweetie?
We can look out the window.
-Better than TV. -We should’ve gone by bus.
Just once let’s do it without a fight. It’s beautiful.
I didn’t want to go with this leg at all, but I reconsidered so we wouldn’t fight.
I’m not fighting with you.
Yes, you’re right. Because you first wanted to take a train and I didn’t care.
I can.
Not much here actually ever works.
But if you saw the bathroom, you might be glad.
I guess not anymore.
I’m sitting here now. You can sit over there, can’t you?
-Little girl. Could we change seats…? -No, you couldn’t.
My daughter has to sit there. If she’s not facing forward, she gets sick. Sorry.
I love sitting by the window. And going backwards.
I love sitting by my wife. In any direction.
Guys. I got us tickets for 3 beers and one grilled meat.
-No, dude. Altogether. -Yea, altogether.
With your shoes on?
Sorry.
Train travel in this country hasn’t advanced much.
The state company wanted to cancel this train line. It was losing money.
We cottage-goers wrote a petition, didn’t we, Sweetie?
-Roman, I can’t see who you’re talking to. -Did it help?
We wouldn’t be here today if it hadn’t. The mayor and regional rep won due to it.
It’s always better to anticipate and be prepared for everything.
That’s true! I knew a person in a camp who was grilling sausages.
Where was she?
Well. She slipped and got stuck under a large root and she couldn’t get out.
So, she was just banging on the root, but they thought it was a woodpecker.
She was there until morning. Fifty meters from the sausages.
Statistically, flying is the safest form of travel…
His father had a small wood shop there.
You got divorced?
No.
He died.
Ah, that’s really nice, isn’t it, Sweetie? Ashes spread next to his father.
But his father is still alive.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
I’m a driving school instructor, aren’t I, Sweetie?
And sometimes I do other things during the drives.
I was riding with Jarmila my client.
We picked up a pig for a traditional roasting.
We still need to think of a name for the band before we get there.
-We haven’t decided yet? -We Haven’t Decided Yet!
What about calling ourselves “And More”.
-Isn’t that illegal? -How would it be illegal? How could it be?
It’s definitely illegal.
It won’t open.
…and when Jarmila drove into the ditch and the car flipped very slow though.
everything was suddenly all over the car. Nothing happened to anyone,
waving, covered in blood. Guts hanging around my neck.
He didn’t brake fast enough and ran over my foot.
Those are quite the stories.
because after hours he would have intercourse with his goods.
He was fucking the meat. The actors didn’t act for a month.
Hey, look at this!
-That’s a coincidence, isn’t it? -Sure is.
You couldn’t make it up even if you wanted to.
I’m glad I moved over here.
Fuck me!
Sweetie, look! Deer.
They’re all velvety.
I’m Petr.
Mr Karajvanov.
Sorry.
I’m coming from work.
Want a piece of candy?
What’s do you do?
The death of a loved one brought you the opportunity to bury people.
You have to do cremation also, don’t you?
Sometimes, yes.
I was never little.
Sound check starts at five. I hope we make it.
Every regular band has a van. We’ve got a train.
So we can only play wherever there’s a train station.
Abraham Lincoln had 48. The biggest of all American presidents.
When they shot him, he stayed standing.
But Lincoln was shot in the theater. In his box, seated, wasn’t he?
He probably just…
Mom? Hello? Can you hear me? Shit!
for one year?
One year.
-I’m in no hurry. -Where are you going?
Nowhere.
If you keep going in one direction,
you’ll get back to where you started.
We won’t get to the cottage until dark.
I wouldn’t like to have a cottage here. They just steal everything here.
We do have an old coocoo clock. I’d really miss that.
And now you keep it.
-Finally. -You see, Sweetie.
Are we going backwards?
Great. Well, now that’s confirmed. Come here.
What in the world?
-It’s a bit late for that, little fella. -The mint at least hides the stench.
Oh well. Our first paid concert and we’re not going to make it.
MUSIC – FOOD – BOUNCY CASTLE
Everything is possible in this country.
-That’s a little much, don’t you think? -Why?
They should announce something, right? We’re going in the opposite direction.
From our view, it’s the forest going the wrong way.
Movement is an illusion.
-Where’s the ticket inspector? -Probably in the bathroom.
There’s just some situation on the tracks.
-Did you feel the impact? -It could’ve been something small.
Maybe a small deer. In front of a combine it cowers and pretends to be invisible.
Or there was some obstacle on the tracks.
I’m sure we could find someone.
For a planned suicide, this track is especially convenient.
It’s a local track, so you can be sure that help wouldn’t get here in time.
Please stop it. There are kids here.
No matter what it is, in England, they’d have removed it and the train would go on.
If it’s a bigger problem, the train would go back and go around it a different way.
Would anyone like some bread? I made a bunch.
Well then I’d take a chicken.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
-It’s wonderful. How do you make it? -Just the normal way.
-Bread, schnitzel, bread. -Unbelievable. You all really don’t care.
I’m going to complain.
Hold up. I’ll go ask. Sweetie, will you hold this for me please?
If you’re hungry, get your own.
Everything’s fine. I’ll find out what’s going on.
In every horror, when the door closes behind someone all by itself…
Hello, Mr Engineer. I don’t want to frighten you. I’m talking now.
This is Roman Hála, a driving school instructor.
Why are we going backwards?
Do you want to try and open it?
-If he’d wanted, he’d have answered. -Maybe something happened to him.
-Like a heart attack. -While driving?
It just happened to a bus driver in Napajedla.
Fortunately a passenger behind him saw it and jumped with his hands on the pedals
That was my dad.
The driver, not the rescuer.
He’s alive.
Maybe he had a micro nap.
-You really didn’t try the handle? -I didn’t want to seem so dramatic.
Maybe he left something at home and is going back for it. Keys perhaps.
Or a bee stung him. And he’s having an allergic reaction.
Fifteen percent of the population have severe allergic reactions to bee stings.
A cramp. Or he’s diabetic.
He locked himself in.
-Or he’s not strong enough to unlock it. -Then we have to kick it in.
-If he’s not dead already. -He’s not.
So, I’ll shoot the lock open.
-Maybe he’s on the phone. -I’d have heard that through the door.
What if he’s listening to music with headphones.
-Or he’s deaf. -Or dumb. -Or shy.
-How, Mommy? -I don’t know. We’ll crash into something.
This is the only train that runs on these tracks. Twice a day.
So maybe we’ll crash into the other one.
Einstein would disagree with you.
Plus, this is the afternoon one. So this one isn’t going back.
-I want to pull the emergency brake. -You haven’t thought this out completely.
This is an emergency brake and we want to brake and save ourselves.
-I’m not a complete cunt, am I? -Read what’s written here.
Pull this handle in cases of danger.
-Well, this would be danger, wouldn’t it? -Read on.
Misuse will be punished.
State companies.
What’s going on here?
Maybe… a kidnapping.
-Or us? Or us in the train? -Why would anyone do that?
-I don’t know. -It’s always about money.
Hey, boys, shut your traps, ok. Let us grownups figure it out.
Revenge. It’s a strong motivator.
Yes, we’re speeding out of control on a regional train at 5km/hr to our doom.
Exactly, Sweetie…
Listen, does anyone here know the engineer?
Don’t waste our time. We can’t be shy right now.
Roman, are you serious?
-Well, I know Kamila here a bit. -Be quiet please.
I said be quiet!
-I also made out with Kamila in Kácov. -Mommy?
It’s ok. You were already married.
and arranged that all of us are going together right now.
-Sofie. -With Sofie’s mom? -How dare you?
There they also try to get into the cabin. But it is based on a true story.
September 11th.
Young man, that’s it. They laid something on the tracks.
The engineer stopped. He got out and they liquidated him, then sent it backwards.
Maybe they took his uniform as a disguise.
Radical Muslims between Kolešovice and Chrášťany on a Friday afternoon?
Let’s leave it to professionals. Excuse me, does anyone have a phone?
My wife and I leave our phones at home when we trail walking.
I have one.
-To the cabin before it’s too late. -Wait. Little guy, do you have a phone?
I don’t own a phone. I’ve got nobody to call.
Mine was stolen. They left just the case, so…
Mine burnt up yesterday. The battery exploded.
I know it almost never happens, but it happened to me.
-I haven’t got any credit. -No credit is needed for emergency calls.
-I’ve got really bad signal. -For emergency calls one bar is enough.
Fine… I sold it in the pawn shop.
Sorry guys. I was embarrassed to tell you.
I’ve got one. Ok, fine. I wanted to call the boys to tell them I’d be late anyways.
because if it rang on accident, you might shoot a friend in the head. It’s happened.
To a colleague.
-Shit, what is it? -PIN?
No, the code. I’m so bad with numbers.
-How about date of birth? -That’s possible. -Or date of death?
That’s not it.
-I’d guess 1235. -You think?
Oh, it’s the number that I…
PUK. What’s PUK? Do I play hockey?
-You probably had too many attempts. -Here’s mine, but just a short call, ok?
Mom, not now, ok.
Mom?
Leave it to me.
-They’ve all been stolen. -Why would they do that?
For traditional pig roasts… probably.
They say it’s the best. Quick death. Painless.
Alright, let’s go.
Are you coming?
-Are you coming? -Of course I am.
Can you smell it too?
-A kind of musty smell. -You can smell death in the air.
and a boy in a small unventilated space. Step back.
Shit. It always misfires when I need it.
Always when you want to shoot, right?
-This one’s old. It’s just my backup. -Why don’t you have your non-backup?
-Use the rifle butt. -I’m not stupid. It’d smash into pieces.
Don’t you want to shoot from the side? What if he’s still alive?
Fine.
The bastard detonated!
-I dropped my drumsticks! -Where’s the door handle?
It’s on fire.
Get out! Get out!
The bastard detonated!
What happened?
He bumped the fire extinguisher UHL254. It’s standard equipment in every train.
You knocked off, activating upon impact.
The Angel of Death.
Sofie, It’s the parrot from the mall.
Hi.
-What were you doing in the bathroom? -I… I was robbed. -What?
-I was robbed at the shopping center. -At what center?
The shopping center. I was embarrassed.
Tissue?
-Anyone got a tissue? -I do.
Do you want a hard candy? Sugar calms you down. It raises the glucose level.
Thank you.
I have a part-time job at the mall.
I called my parents to pick me up but I just got their voicemail
so I locked myself right away in the bathroom.
-Do you think we’re going to believe that? -Calm down. Do you have any proof?
I do.
-Alright. -Wait, so you have a phone.
Sofie.
-Don’t move, little girl. -Don’t be scared, Sofie. Nothing’s wrong.
I’m thirsty.
That’s the second phone you’ve destroyed today. That’s quite a feat, little girl.
Alright, let’s summarize. We’ve no connection to the outside world.
We don’t know why we’re going backwards, what happened to the engineer
Alright, second attempt. On the front line.
<i>We got your message.</i> <i>We’re coming for you. Mom.</i>
<i>We’re practically on the way. Dad.</i>
Hey, someone shot out the window.
That was you.
The train is going so slow, we could jump out.
Well, maybe not.
-I was afraid it was a fire extinguisher. -You see. People aren’t so bad.
-Yea, they left it there. -Give it to me.
Hold this. No, not you. I don’t want to search for it in some pawn shop. You.
Mom, I’m thirsty.
Would you give my daughter a drink?
She’s thirsty.
This is unbelievable. So selfish, in these situations. That’s really harsh.
Tough luck. Nobody will give you anything.
You’d just want to pee after. Then you’d be thirsty again, it’s never ending.
Could I have a praline?
-Don’t be so hysterical. -Here you go.
-More like Gypsy Kid. -I said it was cardboard.
Give that to me.
Miss!
Hello, hello!
Phone!
That bastard turned it on and jumped out the window.
-It’s just a digital clock. -It’s counting down forwards.
A phone. Someone’s hidden a phone.
You can’t smell it on your breath. And you?
When we got on, it was already hanging there.
-What happened to you, Roman? -We’re at war.
Mr Karajvanov owns a funeral service. He knows how to work with dead bodies.
-This grandpa is only sleeping. -Sleep is simulating death.
-So, search him. -My dad believed that when we’re asleep,
Hm, people believe so much different shit. Nothing against your father,
but this man would’ve already built a skyscraper. He’s slept the whole way.
What?
I don’t need a ticket.
I’m retired.
I’m Mr Karajvanov. From the funeral service.
I’m going to speak… to the scouts.
What’s on the chain?
It’s a button. SOS. Assistance services for the elderly.
-There. Now they know about us. -There’s no batteries.
I wear it because of the kids…
and grandkids
and great grandkids…
and great great grandkids.
-Unbelievable, isn’t it? -Yea.
It’s coming from the other cabin.
If we expect that the train driver was driving the train from the cabin
which was in the forward direction before we started going backwards
This theory would be supported by the fact that the cabin you just destroyed
was locked and unused in the time when we were going in the right direction.
Thanks, Sweetie. But leave it to us.
-Could I have another praline? -Of course, of course.
-How long have you all been together? -I… I don’t even know.
Roman is my second husband.
Hopefully the third time’s a charm.
And I’ve been looking really hard.
Men are like a Russian babushka doll.
Let me say this. A good man is a dead man. It’s the same with communists.
They’re faithful partners for their whole lives.
Which is usually around 80 years.
If we’re speaking about the macaw.
Wait, are you sure?
You’re right. There’s not enough space.
I’m gonna kill you. Why don’t you answer my calls?
I’m not going to make the opening act now.
I’m writing you up. I’m closing now. Bye.
Bye.

Hello, this is Roman Hála, driving school instructor.
Thank you, Roman Hála.
Alright, help is on the way.
In movies it’s enough to just swallow the SIM card.
Alright. Listen up. Two updates and only one of them is bad.
Jesus Christ.
You can’t run from death.
The phone was immediately destroyed after use.
Oh.
What now?
-Now we wait. -For what?
For the help, Sweetie.
Oh, of course.
-It looks really nice in color. -A real honest look. It gives me shivers.
What about the text? “Certainty is Certainty” means nothing.
It seemed better than “secure security”.
I’M SERIOUS
Neither do I.
-Now it makes sense. -You think so?
But we were already in office before, weren’t we?
I’ll cross it out.
And why normality?
NOW
Now?
Now. That’s pretty good.
change, potential.
Three letters and it says just everything.
So give a kidney.
A friend of mine has given three already.
but we should probably look at this.
WE AREN’T GOING BACKWARDS
-What’s this? -It doesn’t matter what it is.
-What’s important is that you’re on it. -It’s the train from the last campaign.
-It’s in our region. -Where’d you get this?
-And where’d she find it? -On the internet.
Excuse me. You say nobody’s driving the train, so how’s it going?
Why are you all asking me? I don’t know.
-Oh no. -It’s true you can’t here the engine.
-That’s actually true. -Maybe it’s an electric train.
But going the other way, it was normal.
Maybe it’s both. A hybrid train.
-I want out. I’m getting out. -Can I go with you, Mommy?
While moving, the doors are automatically locked. For the safety of the passengers.
The engineer got out. We didn’t notice it and he was trying to fix it.
Oh please. You watch too many movies.
Alright. There’s a man with a gun.
A broken window. A group of hostages.
and someone, perhaps the train driver running after the train.
-It might be a movie filming. -Or railway emergency training situations.
Terrorism.
-Excuse me, should I make some coffee? -This is too big for us. -Calm down.
-We have to call for a crisis task force. -Call a crisis task force meeting.
-Who’s going to be in it? -For now, the three of us. And you.
I have afternoon Pilates.
-Pissing to the left, huh? -You know it.
Hey, look at that.
They’re here. They’re coming for us already.
The police. Police.
Here, here.
Some kind of entertainers.
-Probably already campaigning. -They really must be all out of ideas.
-They’re already quite drunk. -Sure are.
So just honk at them.
Police!
Police!
Or there will be another patrol car. They’ll definitely send someone.
-It’ll take a while. -So we’re just going to wait until we die?
-And I’ve got my daughter here. -I’m thirsty. -So cross your legs.
I want to go home.
Great, so I wouldn’t drag in the railway authorities.
I don’t know.
And is there one where they came from?
-Probably not anymore. -It’s Friday afternoon, Jirka.
-15 minutes ago. -So the train was still on the tracks
when it should’ve already been at the station. Something was holding it up.
Yea? And what if it’s not? Who’s going to take responsibility for it? You?
Can we find out who’s the idiot with the shotgun? Or put a listening device there?
But maybe because of that, now I should say something.
But resignation is not a solution.
To give up, that’s easy.
I could’ve done that 1000 times in my life.
You’re a natural-born leader. Isn’t he, boys?
And you too. And definitely you too.
So, which one of you knows how to drive a train?
Don’t look at me. They took my papers from me in driving school. DUI.
-But you’re an instructor, aren’t you? -A car isn’t a train.
-Roman? Clutch, gas, clutch, gas. -Look here, don’t make us butter you up.
The boy can give you advice if needed.
You’re all just like my father. I don’t know why I should handle it all the time.
Babusha doll.
-I’m not sleeping. -Will you save us?
There’s nothing to fear.
Alright.
The people nicknamed it Zucchini, Orchestrion, or Runaway Suitcase.
automatic hydromechanical transmission Praga 2…
-Brakes? -Automatic pressure
-controlled by two air brakes. -Momentarily they are not working.
Alright.
and all its commanders.
This would never happen to me in a plane.
-Turn around. -What?
Allahu Akbar.
What?
-Allahu Akbar. -What did you say?
-It means God is great. -Why are you saying it?
Friend, I knew it the whole time.
-You’ve been in on this from the start. -What?
No terrorist attack is successful without the help of someone on the inside.
You went first into the cabin to signal to them.
When you search the internet long enough, you snap.
Better she’s afraid now than for her to carved up like puzzle pieces later.
The story takes place in the year 2022
from the Muslim Brotherhood Party, Mohammed Ben-Abbes.
So, anyone else who doesn’t believe me?
I’m surprised he hasn’t cut off our heads yet. How many of you are already here?
-To the East. -So you’re a Muslim.
What is this?
-This? -Don’t make a fool of me.
The kitbag? It’s just a backpack.
-And no funny business. -Roman, don’t let him fuck with you.
Mortal Combat.
First for misusing the emergency brake. BAC was 2.5 and was fined 2 million.
-Fuck. -And not one working phone on the line.
-So they couldn’t be located. -A professional. We have to do something.
If we do nothing and something happens, someone’s going to be investigated
and someone else will do time. I have a family!
-I know. -Jirka, get ahold of yourself.
-So UOOZ. -You mean NCOZ. -Send the Emergency Services Unit.
There’s still the election. And here you have prime time practically for free.
-What should I tell them? I know nothing. -We have to think of something,
so you actually say nothing.
Mr Mayor, are you at your cottage?
Still at work.
Not for long though. My display is a bit broken.
Hold on… Jaruna? Has the train from Kolešovice arrived?
I don’t know.
We don’t know.
I don’t know, 200 meters, right?
-The train station. -Yea.
There are people here.
A train is speeding down here with no driver. It’s apparently on fire.
We’re coming.
No funny business. I said no funny business!
-Are you going to shoot the backpack? -Quiet, woman.
Now we need someone who will look inside.
Usually they send a specialist in a protective suit.
-What did I tell you? -Is there nothing else there?
Alright.
Who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come,
Give us this day our daily bread…
And lead us not into temptation,
Amen.
Alright.
This is what we train every Friday for.
-Are we taking the car? -Take some axes!
But bring the lemonade. The victims could be dehydrated.
How are we going to stop a runaway train?
Has anyone got a smart phone? With video?
Stop now. Stop. Put it right there.
Alright.
You all will come in handy.
Hey, technicians on the tracks.
Civilians take cover and gunmen, take your position.
You also take cover, little girl.
BREAKING NEWS
The video which today went viral on social networks is not just an internet joke
Why is nobody driving the train? What happened on this train line?
And who is running behind the train? The regional representative will attempt
to answer these questions about the emergency situation that has transpired.
Hello, Mr Representative.
Can you hear me?
Try perhaps moving around a bit for a better signal.
The crisis task force is working nonstop, sometimes even more.
Alright. That’s enough.
but we have information that we are in touch with the author of the video
-AUTHOR OF VIDEO -I didn’t want a viral clip. I’m no hero.
We were sucked into a black hole….
The truth however is that our behavior, our intentions, desires and choices
and over them we haven’t the slightest control.
Because all reality is served to us from the darkness of our skulls…
What? So she had a small sip.
An ashy smoothie.
-Have you seen House of Cards? -No.
There the actor becomes the president of the USA. Do you know how?
No.
Gradually. Episode by episode.
-Or who did you speak to anyways? -To nobody. I didn’t get ahold of anyone.
-Roman. You lied? -It’s not as simple as that, Sweetie.
I really wanted to tell you the truth.
but before I finished, I believed it.
I’m waiting to be rescued.
The outside world doesn’t know about us.
As an expert, what do you make of this?
The cause will surely be investigated. We don’t know all yet. What may’ve happened?
What do you think of his running technique?
I’m getting out. I want to leave. Let me through.
Help! Open the door!
-The press conference is ready. -Have a seat. This is live.
They were standing right here. Crouch down.
Lie down. Lie down.
What is it?
Does anyone want some bread?
I’d like another one.
Pork.
-Don’t you want three? -No. One’s enough for all of us.
How can you eat at a time like this? We still have to inform someone, right?
Fuck.
We’re going over a bridge.
I know that you drink in secret, Sweetie.
And actually I hate you too.
That’s good that it’s out, Sweetie.
Everything told me I’d grow up to be a thief, so I wanted to see what it’s like.
But I returned it. I tasted it a bit.
-I collaborated. -With the Gestapo?
No, that was my father. I just did with the secret police.
I had a small child, a wife.
They locked me up anyways later for something else.
I once took a corpse home.
I was very lonely.
Home office.
My whole life I’ve hated Irena from the class next to ours.
I’m so jealous of her.
I’m sorry.
in a parrot costume…
a virgin.
It’s not so awful. You can live with it.
Even die.
I’m not an RAF pilot.
I really wanted to be. But because of my bad eyes, they never accepted me.
I worked at the base. In the canteen.
Everyone always told me their stories from the war.
The boys even gave me a pilot’s uniform so I’d look like them.
as if they were my own.
I stopped seeing the difference.
You have no idea what a relief this is.
That’s him.
Yea, and he’s armed.
You idiots, get back…
Enough.
Stop!
We did it.
Good work.
Jirka, it’s time.
Oh no.
I’ll pass this around.
-Shall I leave some? -A little.
-Pass me the guitar. -It’s electric.
It’s got strings, hasn’t it?
A Mohammedan beat up a Christian.
Afterwards to both, drinks were given.
What was your code name?
Roman, I didn’t mean that I hated you.
If we ever get off this train,
It’s enough that you love me.
Mr. Karajvanov.
Soňa.
Undress.
Turn around.
Let’s go, Sweetie.
Now.
And now there’s time for your questions.
This is unbelievable, Sweetie. We’ll have two.
Don’t worry, Dad. I won’t say a word to Mom.
EMERGENCY SITUATION, HYBRID, NATURAL-BORN LEADERS, SIMULATING DEATH
COATS, EMERGENCY BRAKE, CODENAME, ON THE FRONT LINE
…AND MORE
The passengers experience a real moment of terror.
Several jumped out the window in panic.
Isn't it?
I know you hate ghee,
I don't have time for love.
He'll escape.
Actually, my status is no longer single.
It's too late.
Remember this.
Tell me.
and then himself.
you're marrying someone else and leaving.
It's not common for Ishana.
I have to babysit tomorrow.
I hope she cancels, I hate that baby, he's so fat.
Have you seen Max?
Yeah, he's here.
He weighs like 25 pounds already.
How's the baby? He's fat!
So he started choking Daria. It was terrifying.
so he was like unable to connect emotionally to the situation.
Like he was really high, but his "inner Nadav"
registered that he was supposed to react,
so he just shoved him off of Daria.
No thanks, I'm pregnant.
Yes. It's all good.
Listen, I was also pregnant once, it's not a huge deal.
What? You never told me.
Although I figured there's zero chance, 'cause of my polycystic ovaries.
And then, when it was positive, I was super confused
But oh my god, not now! Like, help!
So he examined me, did an ultrasound,
it was irritating as hell.
really wanting it to happen already, but also dreading it.
like I hear it but I'm tuning everything out.
Then I'm inside the ward, they give me the pill,
then the cramps, they're like PMS but way, way worse.
At some point I just squatted over the toilet
Although, after the second pill...
I'm off to get an abortion, anyone need anything?
When did this happen? Was it a while ago?
Okay. Thanks, babe.
Have you seen Max?
Who is Max?
Noa!
I love you.
Wait here, okay?
No, no thanks.
I called him, and said "Have you seen the new Noah Baumbach?
Why did you stop after 88 minutes?"
So I was like, "Why did it take you 88 minutes to figure that out?"
Hi. Can I join you guys for 50?
-Of course. -Sure, no problem.
Danny...
-Are you okay? -Yes, of course.
And now you're crying
And now you're crying
And now you're crying
And you apologized, and I didn't accept it
I projected, projected, shamed you, and wrote you a song
I shamed you and wrote you a song
Fat and rich
I shamed you and wrote you a song
A fat white rich boy
Fat white rich boy
I shamed you, and wrote you a song
A fat white rich boy
A fat white rich boy
No, we're not together. Not really.
We've been liking each other's posts on Instagram for a while,
-Did you just get here? -Yeah, not too long ago.
And I thought, how come we don't call the vet?
I'm not following.
Okay.
If you throw in a log it'll smother it.
But we've already thrown in a log.
We said things like,
Listen, once, I was in Berlin,
And we smile at each other,
and I'm like, "I know!"
And, wow,
ALL EYES OFF ME
it's not weighing on me, it's just sort of...
Of course.
Like, I was...
I was super drunk.
and...
I stayed with my Filipina.
-And we went to the beach. -Okay.
and then we got to this pile
And how was it?
It was...
the idea of what I was doing.
But it also turned me on.
And you have a black thing in your teeth.
Great!
You're pretty.
-You're pretty. -You're pretty.
You're pretty.
Don't let the headmistress catch us.
Not Cumming. Did you cum? I'm not Cumming.
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Why did you cum?
No!
No...
What?
Sure, that too.
You can...
pull my hair.
I really want us to try it already!
Thanks.
Come, come.
<i>19 years old.</i>
<i>Turn around a sec,</i> <i>give us a twirl!</i>
<i>Listen, that outfit...</i>
<i>What will you sing?</i>
<i>"Heart" by Christina Aguilera.</i>
<i>"Hurt." You said "Heart."</i>
Really pounding it.
That reminds me of you.
Okay.
Here.
"I need to get there, I'm staying
"Maybe
"But if one day, you'll think that you love me
"But if...
It was pretty late, like around midnight.
And...
You understand?
Wait.
Yeah, I'm just a little tired.
<i>Avishag, I wanted to ask</i> <i>if you were interested.</i>
<i>I'm driving to my mother's tonight,</i> <i>she's having an operation,</i>
<i>in watching Blanca</i> <i>at my place until this evening?</i>
<i>I don't want to leave her alone,</i> <i>she tears the house up when I'm gone.</i>
<i>I need to find her a trainer.</i>
<i>Well, what then?</i>
<i>Tomorrow I shall wake</i>
<i>and open my eyes</i>
Sure.
Sure thing.
Sort of.
So they cut it off.
I mean the bone. They removed some of it.
but it's fine, the operation was successful, now she has to recover.
And how are you?
I had a terrible day, actually.
I'm sorry to hear.
Are you close with your parents?
I mean, they...
I'd forgotten about this.
Once, I swallowed...
Do you know what acetone is?
Of course I know what acetone is. It's nail polish remover.
So I drank acetone.
Why?
I was in...
Mercaz Ha-Rav Yeshiva. It's the most prestigious yeshiva.
Yeah, 14.
And when I got there, I realized everything was pitiful.
I wanted to leave. From the moment I arrived,
whispered, so not to be heard.
And he went crazy.
He was mad that I had the nerve to even think of leaving.
So I drank acetone.
What did you think was going to happen?
I don't know what I was thinking.
And what happened?
And that's it.
From that point on, it went <i>downhill.</i>
-What are "frontlets"? -Exactly.
They tried to figure out what "frontlets" meant, and they had no clue,
take the Torah and place it between your eyes.
It sounded so ridiculous that I stopped.
At some point, I stopped so many things that I realized it was over.
After that I got very depressed.
I listened to records and the rest of the time
Shall we?
Okay. And do you like it?
It was a gift.
Yes. That's right.
-It is peculiar. -Yes.
And I listened to a record yesterday.
Is it okay if I use your shower?
-Sure. -Where? Where is it?
Okay.
No, no, Blanca! No!
Blanca, drop it!
Oh, bummer.
-It's fine, no worries. -I can't deal with her anymore.
Really. It's fine.
Grab your bag. Grab your things, so she can't get to them.
No, I'll put them away.
I'll put it here. She won't get them there.
Are you hungry?
No, thanks.
Sometimes I cook.
Yeah, we had this little counter with a sink.
Really.
What? When? Just now?
That's right, because I came straight from work.
Yes, that's true.
And you were also wearing a light colored button-down shirt.
I don't understand why.
Because.
Yes.
And my skin, it's not too pale?
Are you okay?
Yes.
I want a cigarette.
This day is so incredible.
I'll never forget it, for as long as I live.
Zero capacity to tolerate silence.
You think thoughts.
Kissing is a distraction.
Reset.
by herself to finish her work.
The time was about 10:15 p.m.
Suddenly, the lights started flickering.
She didn't think too much of it.
Shit.
Time to pop the question.
Forget that,
You were there.
Wait up.
Tell you what.
You're a superstitious freak.
But it hasn't made your life better in any way.
{\an8}There's more?
Can't you vomit like a lady?
There must be a wedding that won't make you puke.
Maybe your wedding, Risa.
No way she'll puke?
- Yeah, right. - Yeah, rank.
Never say never.
If there's one for me,
Oh, yeah?
Bitches.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
I'm afraid of messing up and receiving a complaint.
All the details on the Indian wedding,
Let her finish.
Deal! Pay the deposit now?
She's faster than me.
But we have never done an Indian wedding.
It's so easy.
M.S.P.?
M.S.P.!
Beats me.
You don't have to worry about anything.
What is this?
Have it with masala tea and you're in heaven!
You two are ganging up on me.
Here.
Shit!
Okay, I'll be right there.
Aoffy!
{\an8}Years went by, but she'll never forget her man, she's still
Stop!
Don't listen to these clowns.
She's as fierce as a dog.
You told me yourself
When you were together, he never posted about it.
Listen, Ri.
I'm trying to act natural.
Why so nervous?
You've met him during the prep
She's trying to act natural.
Hotter than our friend.
- I would choose her too. - I heard that.
Ri!
Ridiculous.
Wow, like in a romance film.
Squeeze your voice.
Yeah?
Good aim.
Stop. Don't mess with the crime scene.
Serves you right.
This is nothing to him.
Tell him to take a painkiller and massage it.
Why are you calling so late, Jan?
How's Chat?
We are doomed.
Did you call Kai?
He's a monk now.
- Taew? - Died before Tee.
Even if there is one, he wouldn't get here in time.
Is there really no photographers in Hua Hin?
I can't find any.
There must be someone.
I got one.
Who?
No way.
He might not be here anymore.
But why me? You guys know him too.
All you have to do is
A million!
And now,
The unrivaled master of magic!
Shit!
Tim!
Out of the way.
Tim!
Go take photos of dogs and cats
Tim will certainly come!
No time to play with you.
Tomorrow, don't come back.
What? Why not?
You've got the nerve!
Please help me out.
Tim! Don't leave, please help me!
But I don't think we're doomed anymore.
Is that them? Must be.
Hold it. Please hold it.
Shit!
Wait.
My job's done here.
You can pay me now.
How would you prefer?
Wait.
on that lousy chicken feet soup!
What's so funny?
You're unbelievable.
You're a she-devil.
Help!
- The water is shallow! - Help!
Tim!
You scared me.
I dreamt I was drowning and you dragged me up.
Where is my stuff? I'm leaving.
Tim!
Here you are!
Skip that.
Don't tell me...
But one got a fractured hand.
Damn. What do we do now?
Chavee mentioned it's really important.
They will complain, nag and pester you.
So, don't screw it up, no matter what.
We don't have time anyway.
Please, Mr. Magic Man.
Amazing. Let go.
Just one last time.
But sword fighting?
I'm sure he would.
I'm proud of you, Risa.
You should've seen Arun's face.
Or maybe...
He's jealous?
Remember Bam's wedding?
Her groom announced on stage.
Now I remember.
Ri, please. Don't make Arun jealous and ruin his wedding.
No way.
- Can you pay me now? - Wow.
You almost stabbed me.
Whatever. Pay me now.
If you don't pay me now,
that we're not back together.
Can I scan for payment?
Not even one?
- Maybe someone checked out early? - I'm afraid not.
A room with no AC, broken TV, clogged toilet.
Stop pushing him.
He means
Just say we sleep together, he wouldn't mind.
Maybe I can find a room at a nearby hotel.
Really? Funny girl.
Hey.
You can leave in a while.
You can take his room.
I prefer it here.
Which one? Lying we're a couple,
or agreeing to be your lover's wedding planner?
Let me ask you.
Don't you feel hurt?
I'm doing this for the money, just the money.
If you say so.
I thought I'd throw it at Arun. But you deserve it more.
Don't.
Tim!
It's my turn.
Are you hurt?
No.
Hey. Heartbroken?
People come to Samed either to get laid
How's that?
Well, I get bored easily.
Shit!
I thought you died from a broken heart.
My baby.
No! Get out!
You guys going to have breakfast?
Playing your boyfriend. Convincing?
Key card?
What?
Hey! Come back.
Risa!
relatives hand-paint henna on the bride's hand.
Thanks for bringing the horse here.
Where to?
Mr. Karun kept pouring for me. I can't handle it.
That's bad!
This is typical of a Sangeet party.
he still insisted I get drunk.
Now I'm totally wasted.
Take this. Bye.
"Bottoms up, bottoms up." Now I'm so drunk.
Excuse me.
We should find an Indian guy to marry too,
don't you think, Ri?
Where's Ri?
Same symptoms.
Hey, you couldn't handle your wound or what?
No! I just drank too much.
Oh, right... too many drinks.
was too heartbreaking.
Look, they said if anyone wants to dance,
Maybe Arun can get a taste of his own medicine.
Scaredy-cat?
Let the heart beat faster
Let it beat faster
With a little bit of love
How am I to recognize
Who is the one made for me?
Life is a whirlpool
Oh, my nagging wife. Don't worry.
So, how's Mr. Karun doing?
It's his medical condition.
He's fine after taking his pills and getting rest.
Good.
I want to thank you.
- For what? - Everything.
You're a real hero tonight.
What about us?
Ri.
Put that flashlight down.
Hurry up.
The guests are waiting.
Momo! I'm sorry.
Shit!
Hold on tight!
Van!
Monica!
Monica!
Sure, I'm good.
We can only hope Monica will show up.
it will all be over for us.
Like I said to Monica.
Now I know
it's time to let go of this tennis ball.
Ri,
You know what? That actually felt good!
So Monica's not showing up?
Don't worry, son.
But I don't feel like puking anymore.
That's good, isn't it?
Each round symbolizes a different commitment of the couple.
and stick together through thick and thin.
Wait!
Hello there.
But then...
And it's time for me to leave.
But most importantly, I got to be with you one more time.
I took it because
I hope you will meet a nice guy someday.
He may not be a jack-of-all-trades like me.
As long as he loves you
as much as you love him...
Let's eat chicken feet soup.
Sure. You won't stand me up again?
Well... I'm not sure.
Ride the horse?
Hey.
You wish!
Everybody say Hayi Shava
Put your hands up and say Hayi Shava
{\an8}Hello.
{\an8}Nice to meet you.
{\an8}Nice to meet you.
{\an8}What's your name?
{\an8}My name is Maeno Rina.
{\an8}Miss Rina.
{\an8}Um.
{\an8}That is...
Are you listening?
Sorry, sorry.
Damn it, I didn’t hear Teacher Shoshinsha's answer.
What's the issue?
-You wanted to know why blue water becomes transparent? -Ah, right.
That's the reason.
What's the meaning?
It's a poem.
A poem?
-You know what I'm talking about？ -What？
Hey, answer me!
Ok let's go.
Aren't they there?
No.
Nope.
Thanks.
Chill out!
Let's take care of it fast.
Ah, so hot.
Hot!
What we have is...
What is it?
Wow, I've forgotten about that!
-Do you remember? -Hold on, hold on.
What we have is...
Courage.
We are...
Be quiet.
Where is everyone?
Ding dong, Ding dong.
Eh?
Just a second.
Uh, didn't you say they were nobodies?
Yeah.
-Hey. -What did you say?
Hey!
I don't get mahjong. Is mahjong fun?
What?
Mahjong?
Uh...
So what?
You should fuck off.
We're gonna fight?
Fight!
Take this bastard!
Go to hell!
Hey!
You bastards!
Oh!
My gun jammed!
Get out!
His feet!
Hold his feet!
I can't shoot!
Is he dead?
Yeah, he's dead.
That was close.
Ah it hurts!
It really hurts, that bald fucker.
I want a bandaid.
Can I get a bandaid?
Nice give me some!
Oh that's good!
Victory dinner!
Barbecue
Barbecue Barbecue!
What to say...
We got the wrong information from the contact.
They put the blame on us.
Well done, Mr. Akagi.
Yeah.
I thought I could get that high end "Xu Xuyuan" Pork.
I'm very sorry.
I'll give you my share.
Agh!
Excuse me.
We spilled some tea.
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?
It's fine.
Please enjoy
Thanks.
What were you saying?
Well
I'm really sorry about this Yuri, Makoto.
In other words we...
Are treated as wage slaves.
Why not work part time?
We all do the same job right? Killing?
Yeah, what's the difference?
I agree.
Even though I agree.
But this is how reality is.
It's awful.
Mr. Akagi.
What I'm going to say, they're just rumors.
I heard there are more and more wage slaves like you.
But there are very few full time assassins.
Yeah, so?
The quality is different from that of the wage slaves.
Well, then what?
If you kill them, the position will be open.
You've been doing this for so long.
If you can join the organization you can move up.
You must assassinate the assassin. To go full time.
Wow, that's way too risky, right?
Right, brother?
-Fuck em up. -I knew you'd say that.
Knock em down
Well then... Mr. Akagi.
Hell yeah.
I see.
It's these two.

This...
What is this?
(Bill of 3,890,800 yen)
Ten hundred thousand...
3.89 Million...
What!?
Miss Fukugawa
Fukugawa.
Mahiro?
Huh?
What's wrong?
It seems,
Gym.
Gym?
Gym
Did we?
Yeah in Ueno, we only went once.
Ahhhhh
Gym in Okachimachi
But after working out
We slipped into Dessert Heaven and got fat.
That's right.
Yes, yes.
Work out for free.
Ah Dessert Heaven, I haven't been there in a while
-Right? -Want to go again?
-Yeah I really want to go. -Yeah.
Surprising the pasta is the best thing.
-It tastes like pappardelle -That's right
And ice cream for free.
Excellent
So, so.
That was five years ago right?
Are you talking about the pasta?
Gym.
I am talking about the Gym.
Yes, sorry.
It seems we signed a contract.
But pasta every month.
But there are dues every month.
Now they've sent a reminder.
What? What? What?
3.89 Million...?
That's too expensive.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Eh... Mr. Susano.
Did you read the email?
Is there something like a trial period?
Not possible
Huh?
You ignored them so it's on you.
It turns out.
You expect us to pay membership dues for four years?
So
They sent bills every month
It's your fault you threw them away.
Misato, call the customer complaint line
I'll do it
Don't do that.
And
Our association has Happy Assassin Insurance.
The two of you should join
What is Happy Assassin Insurance
If the insured person is over 18, it'll change automatically
What is he talking about?
Very scary.
Ah, so annoying.
My savings get smaller everyday.
That's because you failed so many times.
Yeah yeah.
Your savings are all going negative.
I know.
Go directly to the bank window.
Yeah I know.
We'll pay it properly.
Ah, so hot.
So sore.
Can't we just walk instead?
Isn't this a awesome way to run?
Sorry.
Very good.
Excuse me.
No good.
It's done.
So sleepy.
So so sleepy.
Yeah, delicious.
What?
Tasty.
Yeah.
People...
Which are?
And those who don't show anyone their tongues.
Tongue.
The kind who shows off to others.
Uh...
Eh...
When the supermarket has rice balls on sale for 100 Yen?
Um...
At this time,
That kind of person would definitely get a sausage rice ball.
A silly looking ball filled with mayonnaise.
Nope.
But it is true.
When supermarket rice balls were on sale.
Do they not care about special offers?
Cause salt rice balls are always 100 Yen.
It's true, I feel numb to life.
People who are indifferent to anything,
Ah.
You call someone crazy, just cause of a rice ball?
Eh?
Eh?
Only 30 minutes left?
It sucks I have to eat so fast.
Sorry.
But the ice is melting.
Faster faster.
What's up...?
What's up?
We'd meet our neighbours like this.
It doesn't matter.
No, no, no, no.
He might think I'm a stalker.
No one would think that?
Hush, quiet!
He heard.
So difficult.
Neighbours, go away.
Just to be safe, better use a smoke grenade.
That's enough. Let's go.
Shit.
Wait, what are you doing?
It's your fault for pulling the pin.
Hungry.
Faster
C'mon c'mon.
Hurry up.
I think I forgot to lock the door.
Quick!
We made it!
Crab speed.
No. 45
We want to pay.
You want to pay right?
I see.
Hello.
This is a robbery!
Hands up!
No way.
Put the money in here!
Now!
Why did you choose this time?
We're in a hurry.
Hurry up and grab it.
Faster.
How long are you gonna delay?
Sorry.
I can't remember the password.
Uh.
Ex-girlfriend's...
Is it my ex-girlfriend's birthday?
Hey, cheer me up.
Sorry.
Come one grandpa.
Come on.
Calm down.
Huh?
If you're later than 3pm there will be a 30% late fee.
It's obviously an underground bank.
The rip off went too far.
I feel that way every time they tell me,
The fire burns strong.
Hey!
You guys are talking too much.
Bitch.
Bitch
Big bitch.
Hey.
You looking to die?
Don't shoot suddenly, moron.
It's cause this guy's too damn slow.
quit screwing around and help me.
I am not screwing around!
Lets agree on splitting the work like this.
Don't break formation.
What formation. It's just two people.
Hey.
Of course.
The association won't support you either.
Yeah.
For example
It's impossible to take the case secretly without going through the association.
Taking the case secretly?
Doesn't every killer operate in secret?
That's right
In short,
Like that previous maid cafe incident that turned into a protest,
And never take action to kill people.
I know.
Are you okay?
Very good.
Can I tell you what I'm thinking?
Let me guess.
Um.
Are you thinking about how to take em out?
Bingo.
You really get me.
We've been together for years.
I'll be suspended next time.
Let's talk about it then.
Power.
Good.
Do your job.
Eh?
close your eyes.
Got it?
Yes.
You can't kill them.
What are you doing?
That enough!
Right?
Just do it.
Finish in one minute.
OK
What is it? Dammit.
Hey, they're not ordinary people.
Who are they?
Hello?
Dammit! Where did you go?
I know where you're hiding.
Horrible.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Police... Call the police...
Can I bother you?
Call the please, please don't kill me.
Listen,
Mahiro please calm down.
You have to be calm or you'll scare everyone.
Excuse me,
Can I trouble you?
Is this more terrifying?
Ah really.
That
Answer quick.
Call the police quickly.
Accept your fate, robber!
Robber? I'm not a robber!
We're not!
That's enough, hurry up.
We are not.
Suspension.
Please read the seven assassin rules in the handbook during your suspension.
There are exceptions written above.
Exceptions?
Are you so heartless? Mr. Susano?
We haven't paid our insurance premiums and we're still in debt.
Too much.
It would be great if Mr. Tasaka could secretly help with this matter.
I'm Tasaka. Got something to say?
-Thank you for your hard work. Good morning. -Good morning.
It’s a yellow light when reporting, and a red light when the police arrive.
Your explanation is too long. No wonder you are disliked.
Can you shut up first?
Can't waste it.
What? Tomorrow.
I was gonna go to Asakusa Miku to eat sukiyaki like crazy.
What about Tanesen's plan to eat while walking
You just want to eat.
My ex-girlfriend and I have been there.
What do you think?
Both gentle and cute.
She likes spicy food, so we often go to Mikawa Island...
I'm not asking about your ex-girlfriend.
Huh?
Right.
Let's go on strike.
Yeah, let's strike.
Strike.
Yeah, set up Assassin Ventures.
Be independent.
To comply with labor regulations...
Stop talking about labor laws, okay? Giving me a headache.
if you post this on twitter, there'll be trouble.
Indeed.
And still broke.
Terrible.
(Kogane Canteen)
Every time I come to a Teishoku restaurant, I think about it.
What?
Chicken cutlet meal for 680 Yen.
And a 1,000 Yen yakiniku meal.
Like a capitalistic pyramid.
Huh?
Did she notice?
Did she notice?
I'm too lazy to pay attention to you, but you're clearly staring at her.
Is she a migrant worker?
Go and talk to her.
-Huh? -Do it.
No. no, no, no.
That'd be weird.
Ah!
Let's just say I saw the store on Facebook,
That'd be very creepy.
Huh?
Eh? Eh?
More tea?
Ahhh.
Thank you.
Thank you Miss Sakura.
Huh?
Then I saw your information.
Thank you.
Perfect.
-She has a crush on me. -She's scared, right?
Eh?
Eh?
Welcome.
What happened?
Those two people,
Hurry up.
Let's go.
This is a robbery!
No way.
Wow.
Cool.
Thanks for the hospitality.
Thanks for the hospitality.
You're too shy.
I'm not shy.
What? Is Makoto obsessed with that clerk?
What? Shut up.
You need to quit smoking first.
Impossible, what is this?
Huh? Was it specifically for me?
Makoto, what should I say?
Yes, for you.
I received a gift from Miss Sakura.
I will cherish it.
I must get her something, in return.
If you become an assassin, date her.
Ah.
Okay let's fight right away.
Oh.
It's good to be young.
When I was a student,
I went skiing with girls.
I don't ski, so I can't relate.
What was the era?
Why is it so hot?
No way.
I'm cooperating with you.
Mr. Rengoku's enemy.
What? What?
Kid.
Kid, I didn't do anything to Mr. Rengoku.
Don't kick me, okay?
Wah!
Ah, it gets messy,
Again.
Okay, this is for you.
Just this? Too bad.
Okay, okay.
Hey what are you doing!?
Hey! Hey!
Ah, don't fight.
I just want another prize!
This shitty panda!
Hey!
Please next person.
Welcome to the shiny Tachibana Shopping Street!
Hello everyone!
Hello everyone!
Hey.
Take a break.
This tastes really good.
Sore to the core.
Are you students?
You have a lot to do.
Yes, life has just began.
So you've seen that one?
Ah, that movie was pretty talked about.
We don't watch romance films very often.
Yeah.
Grandpa's words sound like a hopeless college student.
That scene was awesome.
And that one where,
Kasumi Arimura and Masaki Sugata,
Right.
I bought the same shoes.
Ah amazing.
Amazing.
Just open your mouth and smile.
and
and he's in "Drowning Love"
Isn't he so handsome?
Crazy handsome?
So handsome.
Maison Margiela sweater.
Maison Margiela?
Really so handsome.
Of course he's so handsome.
-Sugata, he's... -so handsome.
-Sugata... -So handsome.
Sugata...
3、4…
So tired.
So hard working but so little money.
Can't these pieces be turned into 10,000-yen bills?
We'd make a hundred times this if we killed just one person.
Live a wonderful little lucky life.
That lazy...
-Mr. Matsushita - Is it Mr. Matsumoto?
I always feel like he...
What a weirdo.
just like Maison Margiela.
So handsome.
Ah I surrender.
Tei wins again.
Five thousand yen turned into thirty thousand yen before you knew it.
Is there no next challenger?
Well?
The winner can take the whole pot.
That's it.
That's the way.
Better not...
Are you stupid? What are you thinking?
You can win the whole pot.
Only a fool would do that.
No, think about it.
We work so hard but don't have a dime left.
We have so much debt at so young.
We must make our stand here.
Otherwise we'll be slaves our whole lives.
No your eyes have changed.
As you like.
-Come on. -I can't
-It's okay. -Don't do this.
It'll be ready soon.
I absolutely won't do it.
Play a game.
Please accompany me.
You,
Huh?
What move is this?
What is this strategy?
Will she win like this?
Mr. Tei's pressure failed.
Tell him to be careful.
Don't be fooled.
Great,
Where to go? No way.
Win or lose,
We'll find out.
She's not good at all.
she's here to cause trouble, right?
She's not suited for shogi.
Although she is very energetic.
Why is she here to play?
Forget it, let's go have a drink.
-Thank you. -Let's go.
Let's go.
Failure in gambling means,
Failure in life.
Embarassing.
Sorry.
I have become an empty husk with nothing.
What a fool.
You see,
I bought bean sprouts.
Bean sprouts?
Once we plant em they'll keep growing, like a permanent organ.
Good idea.
Thank you.
It's time to go home.
I have to work tomorrow.
Wait a moment.
You have to keep that promise.
Um
Just watch "Love Like a Bouquet" when you go back.
Okay, come and see.
So handsome.
Maison Margiela.
Just watch it when you relax.
I can't watch this and relax.
I can't remember it even after watching it.
However,
It's all for life.
No hard feelings.
We're together because we love each other.
Why?
You just want to make money.
I won't do anything I don't want to do.
I want to live happily.
Then get married.
Get married.
What are you...
Um,
I always feel,
The relationship obviously didn't go well.
-But he said, "Then get married." -It's really scary.
"Let's get married"
I don't understand why the hero said that.
"Is this a proposal?"
"Are you proposing to me now?"
"It's not what I thought."
lines like this.
Yes.
You just said "Maison Margiela" without starting or ending.
Cheap plastic wrap is like garbage.
That's why life just keeps getting worse.
Let's read the movie's review.
I'm really angry.
Then get married.
I want orange.
Orange.
Um.
Now that I think about it, I spent 1,300 on ramen because I was confused.
Indeed.
Are you gonna bet on shogi again.
Ah.
Do you suspect me of gambling?
When changing clothes,
In your YouTube history,
There was "How to be better at Shogi"
Listen,
It doesn't matter how much money you lose.
No, no, no, it's not...
I didn't lose everything.
Uncle gave me a plush doll that you like.
For you.
I finally made friends with uncle.
I'm your friend too, right?
Got fired.
Worst case scenario.
Mr. Matsumoto is so strong.
Tasty.
Nothing good will happen if I get involved with a gambler like you.
I look for another job.
Really?
Also,
That,
That's Big Mac
Burger and Cheeseburger stacked on top of eachother.
Do you remember the boy who said this?
Also said,
"Buy a double cheeseburger"
I think the same thing when I eat McDonald's.
But even when he tells me the truth directly,
I don't care if I'm being fooled.
Puzzle and Dragons doesn't excite me either.
Huh? Why?
Are you listening?
Ah,
What for?
you misunderstood,
I won't be drawn to gamble in a crisis.
Didn't you just say it hurts?
what? Are you blaming Mr. Matsumoto now?
Good.
After we kill them, I'll ask her out.
I should get her a gift.
of perfume…
Really?
But I have to give her something in return.
I can rest assured then.
Cool.
It's decided.
Nice.
Well I've finished it little guy.
Always so easy.
I hope to meet a stronger opponent.
How did you discover them?
Um,
I smelt gun smoke.
They're wearing combat boots again.
How did you find out?
Um.
Intuition.
Really, awesome.
Yeah.
Wait a moment.
We don't know their identities.
but they attacked us with guns.
Even so.
But...
Miss Sugimoto Gambler
Ah.
Suspended, right?
Yes.
No way.
They had guns.
Same as the last bank robbery,
It's all avoidable.
Yes. Please take this.
and this.
You can do this
Do what?
This can be avoided.
So awesome.
avoid like this.
So cool.
This can be avoided.
Like this.
This report.
Don't forget to pay.
Who are they?
Ah trouble.
Ah, so busy.
I'm really busy.
I feel tired just thinking about writing a report.
Yes.
So lazy.
And it also requires handwriting.
I'm busy.
A ball pen?
Oh ball pen
Yes ball pen.
And...
I always feel like I have such a backlog.
I know.
You understand.
Ah, it's over, it's over.
It's over.
It's over.
then have a drink.
Just go to the bathhouse to heal your body and mind.
Yeah, basically.
Really hard work.
Or go to movies or concerts.
Right.
Any entertainment?
Recently I like to play Catan while smoking shisha.
Play Catan while smoking shisha?
Because I'm a hottie.
Got girl.
-hot girl. -super cute.
Not bad hot girl.
-hot girl -great great.
Mr. Tasaka.
Why don't you make a gesture too?
What?
-What's that? -Don't you know?
-Okay, I'll go home after I'm done. -Okay.
1, 2, 3 hot girls.
So awesome.
You are really good at hot girls and work.
Work is really my strength.
Wait a minute. They escaped.
Wow, wait a minute. No way.
What's up?
We finally defeated them.
you can't shoot.
We can't let them escape.
Ah, we screwed up.
Then shoot them.
Get ahead?
In short,
No, I'll help you.
Bad mood?
Really.
I didn't want to use this gun.
Need help?
Chasing people is our strength.
Please.
Did you hear anything?
I heard nothing.
Yes.
Please.
OK.
Borrowed,
Sorry.
No way.
Are you bullying me?
never mind.
As a cleaning expert, I have to clean this mess up.
Make them weak with fear.
Mr. Tasaka.
so hot.
Mr. Tasaka?
Ah.
I've been shot.
Call the ambulance team quickly.
Wait a moment
I must explain something before I die.
Explain what?
If I die,
Please use alcohol to clean the blood on the floor.
then in the van,
Mr. Tasaka.
Right.
and…
this.
What is this?
Yes.
Tasaka Mamoru
abdomen.
Tasaka Mamoru.
abdomen.
Huh?
Mr. Tasaka, you were shot.
Um.
I was hit by those two people.
Over there?
When were you shot?
4 minutes ago.
Let's find it quickly now.
He asked you to.
Yes.
They work really hard.
Ah.
My head!
My head really hurts!
Is it true？You failed.
Ah,
Terrible.
Listen,
Hello?
Why does Wi-Fi disconnect at this time?
Huh?
What?
What's up?
Wait for me.
I was shocked.
This man also wrote his own autopsy report.
What is it, Tasaka?
Really? Who are they?
Wow it's pudding.
Ah pudding.
Anyway, "Mr. Purge" will handle this case.
The rumor that "working people can join organizations and rise up".
Why would you believe this rumor?
-Do you want a picture together? -No
Really?
Uh.
Eat quickly.
-I'm starting. -Eat quickly.
Please do.
-Wait a minute. -What's wrong?
Huh?
-Wait a minute. -What happened?
what do you mean.
Why do hot girls make us wait?
Wait a moment.
what?
Yes.
First time ordering this set meal.
Uh.
If we win, we can eat it every day.
Every day...
every day.
appointment
Too bad.
-Be neat and tidy -Be neat and tidy
Excuse me.
So hot.
tea please.
Where's the meal?
Two small bowls.
OK.
well,
I searched all night and my back ached.
This is all for Tasaka.
Compared to all drinks?
In the summer,
Uh,
looks so delicious.
Sprinkled a bunch of seven-flavor powder.
It does look delicious.
So expensive.
Do you mean ordering based on the situation at hand?
Uh.
I don’t feel comfortable spending 1,000 yen at a supermarket.
Ah, stop talking...
No.
very happy now.
Excuse me.
That was…
Very tasty.
ah.
Thank you.
That's it.
I will convey it.
Please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Huh?
Sorry for the wait.
Wow looks so delicious.
Wow.
Very good.
Comes with pickles.
This is only 680 yen...so happy.
marvelous.
Cat got your tongue?
I want to checkout.
Go quickly.
What what?
-What are you doing? -I'm sorry.
If you want to play cops and robbers, go outside!
Yeah, it's okay.
Yeah I'm strong.
Wow, I’m angry. I’m angry.
I want to check out. No need for change.
Sorry, I'd better get change.
That's enough. Let's go.
Let's split up here.
I will call those two out to end it.
what?
See you later.
You can't win alone.
I have,
At least,
At least knock those two people down.
Yes.
Yes.
My blood is boiling.
Ah.
Should we contact Mr. Susano first?
No, just report it afterwards,
No? No.
So really delicious Japanese food.
Like,
Same as perfume.
You compare Japanese food to perfume?
Hello.
What's the matter?
Well, that,
We found the two killers.
what?
The norm during suspension is...
Hot-blooded? What is that?
Even during suspension,
Mr. Susano, what happened?
Chisato Kazuma found the two killers.
Then let me entrust it, right?
No.
I'm so angry.
I'm so angry. I'm so angry.
servility…
I understand. I'll pay for that.
No, no need.
Because even if you get shot, it doesn't matter.
Let others decide whether you are cheerful or not.
Um.
Basically
Go ahead.
Ah, you agreed?
Yes.
Please play your part.
Very good.
That...
-Gotta get it clean. -Yeah, we'll get it clean.
Chop it into pieces?
Sticky and rotten...
No matter how dirty the place is,
Yes, leave it to me.
Please kill the bastard who shot me in the stomach.
Roger.
Thanks.
Really strong.
Professional assassins are awesome.
Yes.
However,
We didn't lose either.
Of course, idiot, we will win.
it hurts.
easy victory.
easy victory.
both of them,
Joining our organization should make you a good assassin.
Uh...
They can fight very well.
I only eat chicken recently.
There's going to be an iron party after this time.
Make some pork liver and leeks.
Okay.
I promise you.
Eh...
I promise you.
hold my hand.
Those two women,
Maybe.
Good.
will win.
oh.
What we have is…
Courage.
We are…
strong.
Ahead is…
I'm sorry I broke a lot of promises.
Why are you bringing it up now?
It's okay.
you will definitely win,
I hate you dying.
Bet on me.
Chisato Sugimoto.
You go.
I want to win, Mahiro.
I will handle it.
I am leaving.
Um.
Yeah
you absolutely have to win.
I won.
I won.
Victory.
Makoto.
Good morning.
Good morning.
It's over.
I'm exhausted.
Big brother…
oh.
ah.
oops.
I was defeated.
But we are the strongest.
Yes
Huh?
Of course.
Have fun playing.
next time.
Try it, idiot.
Don't call us idiots, idiots.
Because of you.
because of you.
Makoto,
I didn’t confess to the clerk.
Ah...it hurts so much.
Dare you say it.
Very cute, right?
I give it cat snacks every day.
The tuna flavor is the best.
what? Chicken breast flavor?
-It's delicious. -Yes, it's delicious.
spare me.
Give you tuna taste.
Tuna?
Eat, eat.
Want to toast?
Good idea.
The last supper turned out to be cat snacks,
Just cat snacks.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Is this really edible?
It sure is tuna.
So disgusting.
You try it.
Really edible.
Edible.
Yes!
It's over.
Next time,
I want to live in Hokkaido.
I don't like hot weather anymore.
Not bad.
No…
Counting Akagi, there are three people.
Really been waiting.
It hurts.
looks so delicious.
what?
you see...
Wow.
So beautiful.
what?
So beautiful.
However,
You can have a handmade dumpling party.
Um.
Well,
Let's look it up.
Cellphone?
Huh?
Thank you.
It hurts.
Dumplings?
Yes.
Ming Tai...
{\an8}1715 Mentaiko cheese...
{\an8}1716 Sauerkraut
{\an8}1718 Tuna Mayonnaise Dumplings.
{\an8}1722 Why?
{\an8}1723 Tuna flavor.
Uh...
Ah
you see.
{\an8}1728 Wow looks so delicious.
Dumplings are also good.
Don’t want wrinkled dumplings.
I don't like those kind of dumplings.
{\an8}1741 I want the kind that make your heart race.
Haven't you eaten it?
{\an8}1743 Just as you told me.
{\an8}1746 - Just as you told me - Yeah
{\an8}1747 Good.
This? Are you talking about this?
Over here!
Thank you, lady! Thanks!
More slowly, please. I don't understand.
Really?
No, no! Not the radio, please!
Please, help me! Help me!
You fucking bitch!
I know!
Mm-hmm. How?
Maria, look.
You're an idiot.
Goddammit!
Hey... Watch out!
Jose! A shark! Go faster!
Jose, get out of the water!
Jose! Jose, look out!
Fucking bitch!
No, it's not that.
I didn't want to burden you.
Seriously? That excuse again?
I'm so sick of you saying that!
Okay.
As you wish.
Okay.
Junhee!
Sit. Let me finish smoking.
I came because you're here.
Really? Who told you?
Some people I know.
I see.
I didn't tell anyone that I'm living here.
But I guess someone knew.
Right.
Hello. Thank you.
Yes, hello.
I didn't greet you properly before, sorry.
It's fine. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Then I'll make you coffee.
She looks similar.
Or not?
But who is she?
Just someone I know. She lives nearby.
She helps me at the shop.
I'm okay.
- You stopped writing? - Yes.
You've gained weight. Quite a bit.
I really have. 10kg, I think.
You look good.
You look carefree. More natural, it's nice.
Thank you.
None of my clothes fit anymore.
Recently I read your latest book.
Sorry for not calling you afterwards.
Tell me,
why didn't you contact me?
Was it hard to call me?
No, why would it be hard?
After leaving Seoul, I just felt sick of it all.
I don't mean you. People in general.
Everyone I know.
But you seem to get along with people here?
Well...
I see you have get-togethers here?
It just happened.
People from nearby came, older women especially.
They like it here.
You seem fine, anyway.
People come here to kill time.
This area has no other bookstores.
And I do contact a few people for lectures.
I guess that's how the word got out.
I told them not to tell anyone.
I came to see you.
To see how you're doing.
You treated me well back then. You really did.
It was nothing.
You want coffee? It must be ready.
Okay, sure.
I don't smoke here.
I'll take that.
People here don't like it.
- I guess so. - I smoke e-cigarettes inside!
And I read differently now.
I only read what I really like.
I don't care what others think.
Did you care before?
Yes.
I just...
You've discovered a joy for reading.
Yes.
I read things I never dream of reading before.
Really?
You studied theatre? Did you act?
Yes.
Not anymore?
No, I acted a bit and then stopped.
I'm 33.
And I study sign language.
You look much younger than your age.
And you study sign language? Wow.
Yes, I do.
I'm still learning.
Can you say this in sign language?
While the day lingers, let's enjoy a nice walk.
Okay.
Like that.
So impressive.
So, what is "day"?
is like this.
Like this.
What's this?
"but soon it grows dark."
Yes.
- "While the day lingers"... - "lingers"...
"While the day lingers,"
- "Let's enjoy a nice walk." - "Let's enjoy a nice walk."
"Let's enjoy a nice walk."
Like this.
Like this.
"But soon it grows dark."
"But soon it grows dark."
"While the day lingers"...
"Let's enjoy a nice walk."
From now on,
none of us can hear.
You do it so well!
It's so big.
But we can't leave the shop.
No, it's fine.
Thanks to you I'm visiting here. You say it's famous?
Yes, the inside is worth seeing.
Really?
Maybe it will appear in one of your works.
But it looks like that comic book robot.
Right.
Take care. Thanks for the sign language.
Thanks for today. You came so far.
Let's meet again soon.
Let's do that.
Bye.
I don't take taxis. I came on the subway.
- I'll in touch! - Wait...
but I've always respected your work.
Thank you.
What are you looking at so intently?
It's been so long.
Where did we meet before?
You don't recognize me?
Director Park...
Director Park's wife! That's right.
Director Park's hiding over there.
I'll bring him over, okay?
I guess he's hesitant to meet you.
It seems like fate meeting you here.
Yes.
I'll bring him over.
He's just innocent, that's all.
What brings you here?
Here on some business?
It's my first time here, too.
We stopped on the way back from Paldang.
I thought maybe I could use it in a film someday.
I see.
You're exactly the same. You look good.
You still have that charisma.
What charisma?
You really do have charisma. Truly.
- I have charisma? - Ask around, everyone thinks so.
I don't have charisma, and you do.
All right, thank you.
So you came to meet your friend?
Yes, but...
Why did you hide?
You hid from me?
Yes, it was urgent.
Oh, my.
- What are you writing these days? - This and that.
Turn left.
It's nice here, right?
Okay.
Critics say so too, but I can sense it myself.
Wait, I should try these.
But what's gotten clear?
But I do think something changed. My attitude toward filmmaking.
Really?
Compulsion isn't necessarily a bad thing for someone like me,
so at first I worried I'd get too relaxed,
but it was okay.
For sure.
Before, I thought my life was shit, so I just focused on filmmaking.
Life is so hard to fix, anyway.
But my thinking changed.
So, increase your satisfaction with life.
Then you won't break down later.
Now that you're old, you just want to be comfortable.
That could be it. Right.
Since you're successful now.
You must be quite rich.
Everyone's just trying their best. Life isn't easy.
Are you still angry about what happened before?
No, being angry won't change anything.
I wasn't wanted, that's all.
Right. It wasn't me, it was their decision.
I've got no power. The investor is top dog.
They're the ones who turned it down.
Top dog?
Then you should've shot it.
But there was nothing I could do.
No, you wanted too much.
Shoot your film, make money, become famous...
No, I don't want that much.
Really. I only barely manage to get my films made, that's all.
Turn it to focus.
Wait, hold it here, and if you turn this ring,
it will focus.
It's an expensive lens. Very bright.
Maybe he's looking at women's legs.
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous!
Here.
Lots of people there.
It's gotten warm, right?
It's spring now. Almost.
Yes, it's a perfect day to walk outside.
It smells like spring here.
Yes, you're right.
We came once before, and it was nice, no people.
It's relaxing to get away from Seoul. No crowds.
It'd be nice to live here.
That walking path we saw from above,
that leads to here?
I think so. It didn't branch off anywhere.
Anyway, thanks for walking with me.
Right, we've just been driving. It'll be nice to walk.
Great.
You're right. She's here?
Of course.
Yes, that's her.
Hyojin!
Kilsoo!
You were out walking? You must live nearby.
Yes, near here.
Hello. You're a novelist, right?
You recognize me?
Yes, I'm a fan.
Of your books.
Nice to meet you. What brings you here?
Director Park drove me. I said I wanted to walk.
Good choice. This park is very quiet.
Nice to meet you. I live with Director Park.
You live together?
- Yes, we've lived together a while. - For how long?
Around that. Including when we dated.
- You know each other well? - We met for business once.
But not that well, right?
Yes, about an hour, walking quickly.
But you aren't acting? I haven't heard any news.
It's been a while...
No, I'm not acting.
You should!
Well, I shot a few independent films by some acquaintances.
- But now I've stopped. - Don't you want to?
It's such a waste.
Why don't you want to?
You think?
Why, no directors you want to work with?
You must receive screenplays. You have a lot of fans.
What's a waste?
You think she doesn't know anything?
Everyone chooses the life they want. You think she's a child?
A waste? You know what that word implies?
How can you say that to a grown person?
She's not in elementary school.
Do you love her life more than she does?
Everyone wants to realize their life in their own way.
Not everyone cares about money.
You should acknowledge that.
It's a waste because we value her. She's still young.
She's young, but she's not using her talent.
But what is she wasting, exactly?
Would that satisfy you?
Life is so short, you shouldn't miss your chance.
Everyone has their time.
You know that old saying, don't waste your chance.
Don't waste your breath.
Waste your breath...
Waste...
Honey, I think we'd better go.
- No walk? - Next time.
Thank you.
See you later.
I'm sorry for shouting.
- Okay. - Okay!
I'm sorry for shouting.
You've got great charisma.
Really?
You have charisma.
If you say so.
Can you smell anything on me?
No, do you smell something?
Really? My husband, too.
I slept late, must've been tired.
You're always late.
Of course. Hello.
Nice to meet you.
My husband's nephew.
His name's Gyeongwoo. I see.
So you come here often?
Walking really quickly makes me feel great.
I like walking fast.
Thank you.
So you live nearby?
The maintenance fees were too high.
Maintaining a house is really expensive.
And it's cold.
He's majoring in film.
- What's your school again? - KNUA.
- Really? - Sure, let's talk film.
He's really smart! Despite his looks.
Don't embarrass me.
Yes, that's right.
Did you walk here, too?
Then you know how to use a camera?
Yes, sometimes I shoot my own work. I know the basics.
Let's go together. I need the restroom.
Really? Great.
It's that way.
You waited long?
We were talking inside, so it took a while.
That's fine.
She wants to shoot a short film with us.
Really?
Really? With Uncle? A short film?
I've always wanted to shoot a film.
A lifetime dream, I guess?
Of course, she has to agree.
But if you can spare a day or two,
Right, me too.
You thought of it today after meeting Kilsoo?
But that's a precondition for this project.
It has to be someone I really like.
No, I really mean it.
You're really great.
Thank you.
Thank you, Gyeongwoo.
You two are comfortable together, right?
but I think you can shoot it.
Yes, I see.
All of the elements have to converge.
observe, and feel with my heart,
and she's put in her most comfortable state.
Then the camera...
will capture whatever emerges from her at that time.
So the person this actor meets in the film
has to be someone she connects with,
who she feels a deep emotion for.
All the feelings, glances, and gestures between
I want to capture that with the camera.
So everything has to be comfortable, everything has to be real.
So that's your idea.
What I want to shoot isn't a documentary.
Whatever it turns out to be,
But what do you think, Gyeongwoo?
but I really want to try this just once.
I'm curious about what you'll make.
And if my uncle and aunt take part,
What do you think?
As for me...
Since I love your work so much,
Anyway, it should be interesting.
No, it should be fun.
It'd be great if he would.
Of course.
Since he's an artist too, perhaps...
Of course.
Sure, snacks should be okay. It's a park, after all.
You can smell that?
Yes. I can smell well.
Like a blodbound!
Really?
Her eyes, too. Like a hawk.
I'm amazed. I can't smell a thing!
I'd like ramen.
Whenever I think of ramen, I want to eat a bowl.
But isn't this path nice? It'd be good to shoot here.
Of course.
Thanks so much.
Bye.
Want some tteokbokki after this?
I'll eat this first.
It's flour-based, is that okay?
I like flour tteokbokki better.
Me too.
You must be feeling some doubt.
What does a novelist know about film?
I'm glad.
- There's a school playground. - Yes.
Seems like a good day for drinking.
- You feel like drinking? - A bit.
Do you drink alcohol?
I like to. But I've stopped.
I like makkeolli a lot. Wine, too.
I like makkeolli, too.
I've written many novels. Very many.
Yes.
I guess I've lost the strength to write.
Really?
Of course, I can force myself. I've done it all my life.
And something new might come out of it.
Sure.
You can't find the energy?
But now, my writing feels exaggerated.
I can feel myself exaggerating.
Like I have to keep inflating small things into something meaningful.
That's a big burden. And frankly, it's embarrassing.
I see.
A kind of privilege, even.
And I believed in everything I felt, so it was okay.
But I don't feel that way anymore.
it all feels exaggerated.
But then I just stopped.
We'll see what happens.
You really should rest. For me, it helps a lot.
You seem so honest.
Look at her.
Yes, she really was staring at you.
Really? So cute.
What a cute kid.
Kilsoo?
Two people who planned to come can't make it.
But weren't they the ones who invited him?
He'll arrive in 30 minutes.
Okay. I'm nearby, so I can at least stop in.
But it will be 30 minutes before I can go.
Okay, that's fine.
Want me to bring tteokbokki? I'm at Strawberry's.
We'll be drinking makkeolli, so that should go well with it.
Thank you.
Someone I know needs me for something.
We can meet again.
She's so friendly. She's older than me.
She seems very educated, very sensitive. I like her.
Should I join you, then?
I just like spending time with you.
Great. Shall we drink? They're having makkeolli there.
Can I have 3 portions of tteokbokki?
Okay.
This bookstore?
Yes.
Really?
It's fine. We'll just tell her what happened.
Right.
Hi!
She already drank a lot.
I've seen your films. You were really great.
Thank you!
Want some more?
Really? I thought you knew each other well.
We may shoot a film together.
She wants to shoot a short film, with me.
But you two just met in the tower.
It's amazing.
Today's been one of those days.
A really strange day. Meeting all these people I know.
You're right.
Of course we do.
Right.
I couldn't say this before,
Don't be silly.
It's true. I have all your poetry books, every one.
Really? Thank you. That's pretty rare.
I'm so honored...
It tastes great today.
You haven't published anything recently, have you?
Me?
Well, maybe I'm all done.
Why do you think?
Who knows? You can never know that kind of thing.
Still, don't give up. You have talent.
Me?
If I drink, I can write. Drink some more, write some more.
You have your alcohol.
Why live long? What's the point?
Well, my doctors say I should stop drinking.
Doctors always say that.
But you have so much talent.
- You're blessed! - Me?
And you'll shoot a film with me soon.
I told you. We were drinking buddies.
I never imagined you two were close.
How could you? We never told you.
Right.
Okay.
You're so impressive.
You are even more impressive.
Thank you!
Sir, you're an impressive man too.
Thank you.
This is so nice.
People need to drink once in a while.
Me too, really!
I'm happy, too! Another drink!
Another drink?
I'll get a bottle. Wait, we're all out.
It's okay to drink. What do doctors know?
Right.
It was so nice when we drank together.
That was long ago.
But you've gotten old.
Of course, soon I'll be 70!
Really? I guess so.
Why ask that? No need to tell everyone.
Really?
Ms. Kim, about our film...
Right. Junhee!
That's a bit much.
I haven't decided the story yet.
If your husband agrees, then I'll think of one.
Why?
Seeing you right now,
I just thought of a story.
You did?
What's the story?
No, don't. Don't say anything.
This is mine. Don't.
Okay.
Don't spoil it. Just don't say anything, okay?
- You always spoil things. - Okay then.
No, Kilsoo.
If your husband agrees, I'll write the story.
But the story isn't so important.
The story's not that important.
A birthday, for example.
We could make a story out of that.
So you quarrel, and then you get really angry.
Then your husband arrives there, as if nothing had happened.
Even this kind of story can be used.
- Sounds interesting! - Really?
I like that story.
Because that really happened to us.
And then what?
That's it, for now.
Isn't it too offhand? Don't you need something to pull people in?
I'll do that later.
I like it! Because it really happened.
So I really like it.
That's great!
No, a story needs plot.
That's what we expect from a storyteller.
Another drink?
Sure, thanks.
She and her husband agreed not to.
Why?
Though she likes it.
Should we call her husband?
But were you and the poet really close?
He's lost his fire. Used to be scary to see him drink.
No, he was scary back then.
He's gotten old.
Did anything happen between you two?
What could happen?
It's surprising.
We slept together once after drinking, that's all.
I see.
But he kept calling me afterwards.
After that we didn't meet often. It got uncomfortable.
Yes, he is sensitive.
Right.
Don't go tell anyone.
Don't worry.
For his sake, at least.
Okay.
Have some more.
Thanks.
What story did you think of before?
You said you thought of a story for Kilsoo.
I can't remember.
Really?
I forget those things right away.
It's like smoke.
You're so healthy.
Thank you.
She sleeps anywhere, doesn't she?
I see.
That's good.
No.
Ms. Kim is waiting inside.
Really?
We arrived early. This is programmer Shim Jaewon.
Hello.
You came early?
Yes, around 8:00.
We've already had one screening. For film critics.
I see.
Yes, two people came.
This way.
You can sit here.
Okay.
If you're thirsty...
This theater is really nice.
- I'm excited. - Yes.
To you, too.
I'm really curious to hear what you think.
Me too. Really.
- Enjoy the movie. - Yes.
See you.
It's nothing.
Her husband said something came up.
- A visitor from abroad. - I see.
It's 47 minutes long, so it'll finish at 11:16.
11:16...
11:16...
No need, I'll be watching.
No, what if Kilsoo comes out and we're not here?
Right.
Want to see the rooftop? It's really nice.
Oh really?
I love rooftops.
It's really well done.
Can I smoke over there?
It's an e-cigarette.
An e-cigarette?
Yes, I really need a smoke now.
Then can you smoke over there?
She must want to smoke now that the film's playing.
Thanks anyway, for letting us screen it.
Thanks anyways.
How is the film? Your thoughts?
And working on it? How was that?
What's it like working with a novelist?
She's passionate, to a surprising degree.
And her ideas are very clearly thought out.
And while editing,
Seriously, from beginning to end.
I was really surprised.
Wow.
Must have been hard.
Well, a bit.
Isn't this pretty?
So pretty.
- Here's another fallen leaf. - Pretty color, right?
This won't fit in.
We can shoot in color.
But it's prettier with just two.
So nice.
You finished watching?
Is no one here?
Yes, I think she's smoking up there.
I'll go up then.
You can take this elevator.
I have work in here, but go on up.
Hey, Jimmy.
Uh...
And, um...
just wanted to talk to you about a few things.
Um, give me a call.
Bye.
No.
No, no, no. No.

Mm-hmm.

Um, just touch base when I get closer.
Okay.

Britney! Britney!
Hey! Britney!
This is Brody.
Brody, this is Monica.
Hey, Brody.
Hi.
What's their name?
They're just babies.
7.
We're, um...
Okay.
I've... I've been wondering what you'd be like
I...
I'm not sure.
Hmm.
She's resting.
This is Monica.
Monica, this is Leticia.
Well, let's go.
- Genie? - Here.
Let's go see Grandma.
Oh, hi. Hi, dear.
Oh, give me a kiss.
Oh.
Genie.
Hi.
Hey.
Monica's come to help us.
I told you I don't want anybody from hospice.
It's okay.
- And... And she... - I'm not dying, Laura.
Of course, not. You wouldn't leave me.
Genie? Genie?
I promise you everything's gonna be okay.
Okay? Monica's just come to help us.
I promise.
Hey, Jimmy.
Um, oh, fuck.
But, um...
And um...
I just need to talk.
I just need to talk.
That's all.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
Fuck.
If you could just call me...
Just call me when you can, please.
Um... Okay.
I love you.
Hey.
I love looking at these pictures, too.
It's so pretty.
Oh, that was actually your mom's.
It's not so bad.
Guys, stop running, please.
Oh. I remember.
I'm sorry.
So, that can be a little tricky.
Every phone number you might need is up here.
Paul's cellphone, our home phone.
She writes everything down.
Sorry. Laura.
Hey. Yeah?
She's fine now.
Mm? Okay.
She just needs some time.
You know her.
Yeah.
I'm off.
Oh, you, too.
You get home safe, okay? You, too.
You, too. Bye.
That woman is an angel.
Let's sit down.
Um, sure.
So...
Leticia, because she's alternating nights
between here and with her family.
We actually found this amazing nursing home for your mom.
But she didn't wanna hear about it, did she, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
This is her home, so...
Yeah.
She was.
Um, I hope it's okay with you
No.
Um, it's fine.
I just thought, you know,
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't be
Actually, found you myself.
A little rough patch lately.
No, no. That's okay.
Yeah. He won't bite.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, bud.
This guy's always been very affectionate with me.
He's my little brave heart.
No more babies now.
Have you ever thought of, like, adopting maybe?
Um, sometimes.
Yeah.
What's that?
Actually, if you wind that thing...
and pull this out.
Oh. Don't touch those, buddy.
Hmm.
You're my baby.
Sweet.
Hi.
Can you close the door, please?
Thank you.
Mm.
Hi, baby.
Oh, you did miss me.
I know you did.
You're so sweet.
You know I got what you want here.

Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, no. Thank you.
However long.
I met your family.
They're lovely.
I like Laura.
And Brody.
Yeah. He actually reminds me more of you.
I'm gonna go check on Mom.

Um...
I'll know more.
And how are you doing?
I only want Lettie.

Are you filming me again?
No, I'm tired.
I look awful.

Not me.
Not now.
I love you.
I made you.
You've come out of my body.
Listen, Paulie.
You're right.
Whatever's happening, it's not worth it.
Mom.
Family comes first.
Please don't worry.
I never wanna come here again.
Understood?
I-I don't care what they say.
Promise me.
Everything alright?
She didn't recognize me.
Or areyou gonna tell her?
I wanna show you something.
Uh, this one.
Too polite.
Can he go?"
"Okay, I'll tell him you said, 'Yes.'"
And he'd walk away thinking it was funny.
And you boys would go to bed all quiet.
You'd give me the silent treatment.
I couldn't stand it.
And again, "Mama, Mama, can Paul go?
Please let him go, Mama.
Please, please let him go."
and say, "Fine.
And together, we'd watch you go.
I never could resist him...
You always got what you wanted that way.
That little devil.
I'll show you the rest later.
Should I come?
Her condition is worsening.
Um, the tumor is growing,

I have to take this. Okay.
You need to stop calling me once and for all.

This feels like another life.
One day...
"I can no longer be your mother."
That's what she said to me...
with five minutes to spare,
so we couldn't talk about anything.
And that moment is burned into my brain.
I used to...
fantasize about coming to find you and living with you.
I thought about you, too.

But as your lawyer, I need to hear the story firsthand.
I just want the trial to end.
Ms. Sung.
So I need you to tell me everything.
Mr. Lee.
I did it.
I don't believe you're guilty.
Ms. Sung.
This trial isn't about you.
Do you think it's you who should be on trial?
It should be the man who did this to you.
So take your time and tell me.
Right?
So which is it?
Your initial denial or your confession later?

Hey, make sure you don't lose that woman.
The husband was a businessman. Seems like he was quite wealthy.
He had a considerably large inheritance and multiple life insurance policies.
She confessed, right?
Then when the police obtained her journal, she confessed.
Her journal?
Yes, she made notes about her plan--
She wrote things like how much dosage would be lethal, written like daily diary.
Well, then…
she's not getting away with it.
This journal…
Man, those people…
The guys at the homicide unit don't exactly do things by the book, so…
Did they rummage through stuff and just take the journal?
Is it a public attorney's job to nitpick about how cops work?
I still have to do my job.

I didn't think you'd come.
Why not?
I told you I have nothing more to say.

<font color="#FFFF00">FIRST DATE OF TRIAL</font>
Sung Yoon-ah, Your Honor.
Prosecution, please state the charge.
Yes, Your Honor.
<font color="#FFFF00">PROSECUTION</font>
The defendant and the victim, her husband Lee Sung-jin, had marital issues.
As the victim's assaults continued, the defendant decided to murder him.
At around 2 a.m. on August 21, 2021, at the victim's home,
the defendant took a lethal dose of propofol which she had obtained
and injected it into the victim's right arm.
Once the injection was complete,
<font color="#FFFF00">LEGAL COUNSEL</font>
No, Your Honor.
In fact, she is the victim of her husband's habitual abuse.
Defendant, do you agree with your counselor?
Defendant?
Yes.
Yes, Your Honor.
Very well.
Then let's look further into evidence.
<font color="#FFFF00">LEGAL COUNSEL, DEFENDANT</font>
Your honor.
First, we deny the admissibility of the police report.
Same for the prosecutor's report
We agree to the autopsy report.
we admit that the confiscated journal belongs to the defendant,
but we do not agree to its admissibility.
Hold on.
The defendant was under duress during the entire interrogation.
Any further evidence from prosecution?
All right.
Next time we convene, we'll first examine Lead Officer Kim.
Ms. Sung.
You did great.
Thank you.
Mr. Lee.
Yes?
Of course.
Please let Min-ji know that I'm doing fine.
<font color="#FFFF00">FIRST GRADE, CLASS 2 LEE MIN-JI</font>
Thank you for coming all this way.
My pleasure.
So you like drawing, Min-ji?
I'm your mom's friend. I'm helping her with something.
You doing okay with Grandma?
A face.
I see.
Hey, Soo-ah. Where are you?
I'll let you choose.
It's my duty as a citizen before I'm a journalist.
You were sad for the stray cats, too.
Did you meet the kid?
I did.
But that woman…
maybe she's still putting on a show.
Like those rumors online?
Think about it.
Basically, she'll get it all.
Don't tell me it's because she looks like a nice person.
I think she's hiding something from me.
She could've been forced to give false testimony under duress.
What footage?
And I saw this.
What is this?
Sir, are you a homicide detective at Yeoju Police Station?
That's right.
Yes.
<font color="#FFFF00">SECOND DATE OF TRIAL</font>
We found this while searching the property.
So I immediately seized it as evidence.
No, I believe it was given by voluntary submission.
For that to happen, you need the owner's consent.
Yes, I did.
How?
No, not really.
Mr. Lee, I don't think you know how it works in the field.
But I'm talking about the law.
On August 29, 2021, you testified to the prosecution that a crime reenactment
Yes, she volunteered to participate.
Your Honor, a passerby recorded the scene that day.
May I publish it to the court?
Go ahead.
-Push her. -I said closer.
-You poured it on his face! -Hey.
How did you dispose of it?
-Come on. -You must've hidden it somewhere.
That, to me, doesn't seem voluntary at all.
Wouldn't you agree?
This was only a part of the process. Overall, it was fine.
It was fine?
So, has this been the norm for police investigations?
Mr. Lee.
Counsel, will that be all?
<font color="#FFFF00">WITNESS</font>
Ms. Sung.
Yes?
During interrogations, your statement changed a bit.
Please tell the truth here today.
Yes.
In the morning of your husband Lee Sung-jin's murder,
you were arrested and interrogated, correct?
Yes.
I said, we both used propofol and fell asleep.
And when I woke up in the morning, he was dead.
Yes.
When I woke up…
I couldn't bear staying at home.
Why not?
Could you be more specific?
I was scared.
Scared of what?
I felt, if I stayed…
That's what I was scared of.
What happened on that night before you used propofol?
Are these bruises from the abuse that night?
Yes.
What happened next?
Then…
Were you sexually assaulted?
Yes.
Yes.
you found him dead, correct?
Yes.
So it's possible that there was an intruder
while you were away?
No further questions.
Mr. Kim, any questions for the defendant?
Just a couple of questions.
Defendant.
You stated that you both used propofol and fell asleep.
Then, you woke up first, correct?
No, I didn't.
Then who did it?
According to the police report, there was no sign of intrusion.
You're saying the victim gave himself a lethal dose of propofol?
Objection, Your Honor. In the August 25 police report,
This is without factual evidence.
Mr. Kim's question is leading and calls for speculation
Denied. Let's hear what the defendant has to say.
I can't say for sure.
But it's true that he had been increasing the dosage.
I see.
Mr. Kim, any more questions?
Thank you, Ms. Sung.
Mr. Lee.
Yes, Mr. Kim?
Why are you working so hard?
It's my job.
But you do know what happened, right?
She clearly did it.
Come on, why does that matter? We all know what really happened.
Mr. Kim.
Don't you want to become a prosecutor?
Working hard is good.
Mr. Kim, I'm the defense attorney on this case.
So?
Seems like the prosecution made a few mistakes with this case.
I think I want to correct them.
All right.
If that's what you want.
<font color="#FFFF00">YEOJU CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION</font>
You look awful.
What brings you here?
But we only have 20 minutes, so…
I plan to tell the truth from now on.
Come on.
Fine.
I was thinking about testifying in your favor.
"I feel bad for the deceased, but…
He's my brother, but I felt sorry for my sister-in-law.
She had every reason to do it."
I'm being sincere.
So you want me to admit to it.
Yoon-ah, don't get too greedy.
If I say that, you'll have no problem getting probation.
Really, why are you here?
In return, I'd like you to give up your custody of Min-ji.
You haven't changed one bit.
I filed a petition yesterday…
so I can get custody of Min-ji.
They won't let a murderer take care of a child.
Hey.
Don't act like the victim.
You wanted him dead, too.
Not as much as you.
I'd consider my offer if I were you.
Yoon-ah, where were you?
Fresh air?
Where'd you get fresh air?
With whom?
Why you!
Tell me
Tell me.
Mom?
-Inmate 4688! -What is it?
Calm down!
4688!
What happened?
What's this about? Who did this to you?
Excuse me,
Why is she handcuffed?
She's on a special watch.
For what?
Your sister-in-law? Lee Ji-young?
She wants to take Min-ji from me.
What?
She want custody of Min-ji.
Explain it to me in detail.
She filed a petition for child custody.
She will do anything to take Min-ji away from me.
No matter what it takes.
Ms. Sung.
Let's focus on the trial for now.
The only witness have left is Ji-young, whom we can handle.
no one can take Min-ji away from you.
Trust me, and let's focus on the trial.
Okay.
And they searched your house again.
No, there isn't.
-You couldn't tell which color it was? -Couldn't tell. No.
This is Sung Yoon-ah's car entering the park by the river?
Correct.
It looked like they were hugging.
<font color="#FFFF00">WITNESS</font>
The defendant was wearing this coat that day.
We issued a warrant and obtained it from her house.
Sir, is this the coat you saw?
Yes, that's right.
Then she got in the car, hugged the driver…
Did she kiss the driver?
Well…
I didn't feel like I had to know.
The plate number or a car model?
Not sure about the plate number.
But I think it was a white sedan…
It may have been an Audi.
Your Honor, by circumstantial evidence, the defendant was out that night,
Now we must ask
whether she acted alone or with the help of an accomplice.
Your Honor, this is all but speculation.
We cannot amend the indictment with a conspiracy charge,
based purely on speculation.
For now, let's conclude the direct examination.
Does the prosecution wish to continue?
Counsel, would you like to cross-examine?
Yes, Your Honor.
Just a few questions.
Sir.
You first testified to the prosecution
more than two months after the incident, correct?
Yes, I spoke to them last week.
Yes, I remember clearly.
Even though she is a complete stranger to you?
It must've been quite dark at the time.
But I know what I saw.
<font color="#FFFF00">HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH</font>
The thing is, I've seen one of Ms. Sung's movies.
No further questions.
Your Honor, the witness' testimony today
revealed that the defendant met someone on the night of the crime.
The defendant refuses to answer. That's--
The rendezvous is a private matter and has no relevance to this case.
I'm not sure I understand.
If she didn't conspire with him, why can't she reveal who he is?
Ms. Choi, this case is getting interesting.
It is.
The defense has significantly lost credibility.
I suppose.
Is her lover the accomplice?
Yes, ma'am.

Just when I thought it was all over,
like a miracle, someone walked into my life.
The book we'll be discussing today is Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.
Its original title was The Hours, which essentially means time.
Woolf later wrote another novel called The Years, meaning the passage of time.

Before her death, she wrote the last letter to her lover.
Always the hours between us.
Always, the love.
<font color="#FFFF00">LIKE A MIRACLE, SOMEONE WALKED INTO MY LIFE</font>
So, there was someone.
How could she hide it from you?
I did.
She said she'd rather fire me than tell me.
She's got some nerve.
At this rate, acquittal is pretty unlikely.
-Just saying it's a possibility. -You know what?
Come on. Don't give up just yet.
If you stay persistent with this case,
you'll definitely get the attention of the top brass.

You have to bring her back safely.
Don't worry.
Be gentle.
Still, be careful.
I got this.
Sorry for calling you so late.
You said you found me online?
Yes.
Did you bring cash?
Please sit down.
She looks quite young.
She gets that a lot.
-You must have a cold. -I do.
She won't feel a thing, right?
No, don't worry.
Is that propofol?
Yes, that's right.
The same thing we use on people.
So do you give it to people too?
Are you really here for your puppy?
Give her to me.
I've had her for 12 years.
Let me think it over for another day.
Stop!
Even for yourself.
She's coming.
Ruby, Ruby. My baby, Ruby. Oh, dear.
You're sweating.
You okay? What happened?
My heart. Hold on.
What?
It went well. You owe me.
You know, that woman offered me a shot, too.
What?
That's more than what we bargained for.
Seriously?
We're all set. Let's go.
Off we go.
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
and if I testify falsely under oath, I shall be punished for perjury.
Ms. Lee, are you the victim Lee Sung-jin's sister and the defendant's sister-in-law?
Yes, that's right.
How was the victim's relationship with the defendant before his passing?
Mr. Kim.
May I first say something to the judge?
Ms. Lee, please answer my questions first.
You see, I'm devastated…
for my brother.
For my late brother's sake, I want to raise Min-ji myself.
That's why I filed for custody.
What was the victim's relationship with the defendant like before he passed?
Before my brother died, he told me several times that he was scared.
Scared of what?
Of the defendant.
But she would hit him back and raise hell each time.
Objection, Your Honor.
That question is leading.
Very well.
Ms. Lee. Earlier, you had described how intense their fights were.
What would they argue about?
He said…
Another man?
Yes.
That she was plotting something?
That's right.
He was afraid for his life.
No further questions.
During your direct examination,
you said you had filed custody of the defendant's daughter?
I did.
You have your own children, but you want to be her legal guardian as well?
That's right.
Were you always so concerned about your niece?
Yes, of course.
If she is found guilty of homicide,
the defendant will lose the right of inheritance.
Then, all of Lee Sung-jin's inheritance would go to their daughter Min-ji.
Are you aware of that?
and is badgering the witness.
No, Your Honor. These questions are relevant to possible motives.
Understood, Your Honor.
Let me rephrase.
If the defendant is found guilty, you'd become your niece Min-ji's legal guardian
and be able to manage the wealth, correct?
I can't let a murderer raise her, can I?
According to the defendant,
last fall, you asked the victim to loan your husband some money for his business.
Is this true?
No, it's not.
That's nonsense.
That woman made it all up.
The records show that before the victim's death, you called
Why did you do that?
Ms. Lee.
You once worked as a registered nurse, correct?
Yes, and?
You've injected propofol before, yes?
How can he be so insulting to the victim's family?
Objection, Your Honor. Defense is asking questions irrelevant to the case.
No, Your Honor.
She had been regularly supplying psychotropic drugs to the victim.
Ms. Lee. You supply propofol for humans, too, don't you?
That would mean your main clientele isn't just pets,
but people who want propofol for themselves, correct?
If he continues this way, I will refuse to speak.
-I never did such a thing! -Ms. Lee!
Mr. Lee.
That'll be all.
Yes, Your Honor. No further questions.
Your Honor, defense would like to submit into evidence a transcript
of Ms. Lee's conversation with a client while preparing to euthanize a pet.
We don't know who's speaking in the recording.
There's a great possibility that it was fabricated. Prosecution objects.
I'll also submit the audio recording separately if necessary.
For now, the court will delay the decision on the admissibility of the evidence.
Counsel.
I'm all right, Judge.
It doesn't matter. I'm just doing my job.
Ms. Choi, can you keep a secret?
I hope you didn't wiretap anyone.
No, I didn't.
Even if I allow it as evidence, it doesn't prove her innocence.
If Lee Ji-young was the supplier,
she could've snuck in and murdered him that night.
That's possible, but…
for now, all you can prove is that she may have been his supplier.
Such evidence won't hold up in a higher court.
Do you really believe everything your client is saying?
I believe she's innocent.
I'm sure she has her reasons for hiding it.
But I'll find out.
I see.
But is that really what she wants?
If she wishes to hide the truth,
Only knowing the truth will allow me to help her.
Fine.
Were you watching cartoons?
Yes.
You like that show?
Yes.
Grandma went out for a second.
Can we turn off the TV?
Min-ji, you're so smart and clever.
Min-ji, you miss your mom a lot, huh?
You don't miss her?
Yes, I miss her.
I'm sure you do. You must miss her very much.
Nothing.
What? What didn't you see?
I didn't see anything.
Min-ji, you gotta think hard.
I didn't see anything.
-Min-ji. -I saw nothing. I saw nothing.
How's Min-ji?
Her fever's gone down.
What happened?
Her aunt came by this afternoon.
Everything okay with Yoon-ah?
Your mother's friend.
She'll be back soon.
Mr. Lee.
Yes?
I'm scared.
It's okay, Min-ji.
Scared of what?
I keep seeing him
In your dreams?
Who?
My dad.
Mr. Lee.
Mr. Lee.
Yes?
It's okay, Min-ji.
A promise?
I promised my mom…
If I keep my promise, she'll come back soon.
Right, Mr. Lee?
Of course.
You'll see her soon.
<font color="#FFFF00">WHO WILL COME?</font>
Of course.
All right.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yes.
Your coffee, sir.
Do you know Ms. Sung Yoon-ah?
She comes here often.
What?
You can send faxes here, right?
Yes, we have a fax machine. We can help you with that.
But how do you know Yoon-ah?
We're just friends.
The weather's gotten warmer.
Yes.
It's been over three months already.
I hope Min-ji won't look at me like a stranger.
Ms. Sung.
What?
According to prosecution, Min-ji saw something that day.
-She's their principal witness. -She's not even eight yet. She can't!
Why does that matter?
Was he the person you met
Did Min-ji see that man?
Tell me if I'm wrong.
I did it.
Ms. Sung.
What are you doing?
No, I did it.
Ms. Sung, don't do this.
Please go, Mr. Lee.
I'm trying to help you.
I said, just go.
Ms. Sung!
You're trying to help me?
No one can help us.
However, beneath her lies, there was sincerity.
<font color="#FFFF00">LEGAL COUNSEL - DEFENDANT</font>
All, rise.
<font color="#FFFF00">FIFTH DATE OF TRIAL</font>
You may be seated.
Prosecution, did you apply to call a witness?
Your Honor, I call Lee Min-ji, the defendant's daughter, to the stand.
Counsel, do you agree?
Don't worry.
defense would also to call a witness to the stand.
The witness is present here today.
So with your ruling, I'll examine the witness right away.
Objection, Your Honor.
We don't even know who it is.
You asked the defendant to reveal whom she met in the car.
That person is here in this court.
Choi Eun-joo, the presiding judge of this court.
Mr. Lee, what is this nonsense?
To further this case by proper procedure, the court will go into recess.
All, rise.
As the chief of this judicial branch, I will now preside over this case.
Counsel, would you like to call a new witness?
This is quite unusual.
As you know, you may be convicted of perjury if you give false testimony.
Ms. Choi, until now, you were the judge overseeing this trial, correct?
Yes.
You are also a witness who saw Ms. Sung Yoon-ah
Yes, I am.
To be precise,
Yes, I was.
Ms. Choi,
The defendant and I…
are in love.
Yoon-ah.
Let's go to get Min-ji.
Let's take her and go to my house.
No.
You don't know what he's capable of.
Yoon-ah, don't be scared. You did nothing wrong.
None of this is your fault.
Let's not see each other anymore.
If he finds out…
No, if anyone finds out--
Stop talking nonsense.
Yoon-ah, do you remember?
"Do not fear, for I am with you."
I will be with you.
Let's find a way, okay?
I have to go before he wakes up.
Yoon-ah.
So, the defendant said she'd go back before the victim wakes.
Yes, that's correct.
About what time was that?
According to this dashcam footage,
Ms. Choi.
I…
I was terrified of losing everything I have.
But I realized…
losing that one person…
would mean…
losing everything I have.
Right now…
Thank you, Ms. Choi.
Ms. Choi, you're free to go.
You may return to your seat.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
<font color="#FFFF00">THE YEARS</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">THE HOURS</font>
Do you like Virginia Woolf?
Anywhere where there are no people?
Wanna go jumping?
Yoon-ah.
What happened, huh?
I wish I could go.
Where?
There, the real Havana.
Then let's go.
I always wanted to go there.
For a long time.
I'm placing everything in your hands.
What made you change your mind?
Just as I want to protect her
Mom.
I didn't say anything to anybody.
Okay.
You kept your promise, so I'm here now.
Mommy.
It was all a dream, right?
In my dream, I punished Dad,
so he'd stop hitting you.
Okay.
You can forget it all.
She's able to sleep well now.
But there's something chilling about it.
Min-ji was really asleep that night, right?
<font color="#FFFF00">SUPERGLUE SEOMYEONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 1-2</font>
Min-ji.
You're gonna promise me something, okay?
<font color="#FFFF00">TWO YEARS LATER</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">YEOJU PROSECUTION</font>
Stop making excuses.
Should we issue the warrant?
I promise there's nothing else.
Let me think about it.
-Let's bring him in again. -Okay.
but protecting the truth.
So I turned the light on
It usually kind of shows itself
What we can offer to you is a reasonable reduction
Maybe I don't say it enough that actually,
If for example a Black guy doesn't have
she made about actually,
in the hope that something will change.
Dick, cock.
The weather is rather dry...
Here we are.
The wallpaper is melting.
This place is...
Move your legs, like this!
You think so?
Sir, I'm really sorry...
That's up to your landlord, not me.
You might be single your entire life.
Isn't it time to quit?
Are you an alcoholic with anger management issues?
Not bad.
No way...
Come on!
Ghosts don't exist!
It's my first day here, and a ghost...
No, ghosts don't exist.
Damn it.
Excuse me.
You're here, right?
I just moved here.
I'll free you.
I have all these tools.
Sorry...
Good night.
I'm fine.
The sun is out.
How pathetic...
Hey, over here.
The walls are super thin.
You talked down to me first!
Hey...
but they hate each other.
I couldn't take it anymore, so...
How stupid are you?
Why should I come closer?
All right?
Let's not waste time and emotions.
We should compromise.
You can't even play the guitar!
You psychopath...
That psychopath...
We'll see how long you last.
I'll be right there.
Don't glare at me like that!
Cold-hearted bitch.
Look how dark it is!
Focus on what's in front of you.
Should I fight her?
Oh, lord...
What's that sound?
How's that?
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Listen to him suffer.
You'll regret this!
Am I going the wrong way?
Where are you? You're dead meat!
You're dead meat!
Why is this alley so long?
What...
We live in different buildings, with different addresses.
Different addresses...
She lives next door!
Let's take a look... My phone!
I ran around for nothing...
I'm about to hyperventilate...
You...
That's it?
That won't be enough.
Let's compromise!
Compromise, you say?
Then, say 'please'.
Go on.
You bastard crossed a line.
All I'm getting is the vibe of a crazy psychopath!
Good luck.
Fine, it's your time.
No, 1 minute!
Time over!
Time over!
Let's drink.
I know.
It's me.
I'll let them stay until midnight.
Let's go in.
Go in?
Get inside!
- Tomcat! - Tomcat!
Tomcat!
They're visiting my in-laws.
I'm free tonight.
They're visiting his in-laws.
Oh, Dream Again.
Oh, I'm sure.
Your other friend left just now.
The fruit seller.
Hey...
No, she's a ghost.
Right.
Me, too.
Oh, I'm screwed.
Just tell her that you're really sorry.
I told you, she's a psychopath!
Use these grapes to beg for forgiveness!
Don't ever get drunk and call me again.
I'm being serious.
They're Korean grapes, you lying bastard!
Hey...
I'm really sorry about last night.
I'm on my knees right now.
You're lying.
No.
The thing is...
Fine, let's do that.
It's my time now.
I...
Hey...
Please pray for me.
Okay?
Ghosts are like gods, after all.
What's wrong?
You're all by yourself.
Just...
Tell me, okay?
Come on, college has been forever.
Even a married guy is coming.
- Tomcat! - Rock and roll!
Dr. Jang, come on!
Stop that.
He left, so stop it.
You're so selfish.
Fine.
- Cheers! - Cheers!
Long time no see, Seung-jin.
It's nice to see everyone again.
I quit, but...
Listen.
You'll congratulate me, right?
Okay, see you.
It's your time, but you weren't home.
Are you practicing, or just drunk?
What does it matter?
I'm working on my mental state.
Yes, a long time ago.
So, leave me alone tonight.
What a loser.
I'm a loser.
I have no job.
you can't sing from the heart.
I am proud.
But...
I'm getting more and more confused.
With zero progress.
Whatever it may be.
Objects, emotions...
Then, you'll progress.
♫ I'm entering ♫
Mail delivery.
- Ms. Hong Ra-ni? - Yes.
I passed!
I passed the second audition!
That's why...
That really worked!
Korean, Chinese, Western...
Not bad, right?
How about sushi?
Why not?
Tonight's no good for me.
Instead...
Where are you looking?
Then...
Open the can!
Cheers!
Cheers!
I guess.
Spend all of the time until the evening.
so he asked to show my personal work.
Maybe we should have appealed.
- You little... - You stink!
He's firing up my love of justice!
That's it. One...
Are you crazy?
- All right. - Now, lift!
Why are you shaking?
What sport did you use to compete in?
Wow...
Work for manly thighs!
Wait... Hold on...
Put down your phones.
It's coming out...
Stop!
Put down your phones.
Um...
Is that so?
Why isn't she outside, enjoying the weather?
Talk to me.
That was you, right?
How did it feel?
You went 'wow', right?
A child?
Why do you keep talking down to me?
Cheers!
Let's see...
Doesn't it get boring?
I'm even more fun in person.
Should we...
Meet in person?
But after this audition, I might become a superstar.
What if I ignore you after that happens?
I'm feeling generous.
I don't want that.
You're my girlfriend now.
You'll be my girlfriend, right?
'You're my girlfriend now.'
A bit higher!
Hold on...
Then...
See the place on the right?
All right, let's go there.
Okay.
Slice them how?
Oh, thin slices.
Let's cook it.
After the meat's done, cook the veggies.
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
Finished!
Looks great.
About having sex first?
Not seeing you makes things more exciting.
He likes it!
Ra-ni, you look much better than before.
I'll come kill him.
Hey, come here.
You bastards never answer your phones!
Huh? Hey...
I had all of the comic books in the series!
I had every single book.
They're going to use your design for the new character?
Hold on.
Sorry to barge in.
I know this is wrong...
But you're the only person that came to my mind.
Could we talk?
Calm down.
Let's go talk outside.
I need to think.
You were still trying to quit smoking.
I guess that's why I thought of you.
You're still the same.
You need to pass.
Hey!
You're crazy.
How about it?
You'll do it, right?
We'll split the profits.
But this is a big deal for us, and for you.
I brought this, just in case you forgot.
Remember how hard you worked to make your dreams come true?
You would even pull all-nighters.
Let's achieve it together.
I'll work for my company. You work for your dream.
Next up is my character design prototype.
Everyone will love...
Hong Ra-ni, hey!
You were home all day, right?
Did something happen?
My ex-lover didn't come to see me.
Nothing as dramatic as that.
I'm heading out.
What's the use of overreacting?
I'm not a child.
Yes, that's right.
Are you feeling sick or uncomfortable?
Not at all.
I'm sorry.
Please film your daily life, like a vlog.
Damn...
I'm working late.
You seem busy.
Things are hectic these days.
I'm jealous of you.
Dong Won-chang?
Dong Won-chang.
With this contract, they can steal her copyright.
The copyright of the changed character goes to him.
Let's go.
It's Ra-ni.
Hong Ra-ni.
Excuse me.
Ra-ni's sick. She's sleeping.
How sick? Is she okay?
She struggles by herself, and then falls ill.
But...
Her condition improved after meeting you.
Sometimes, it's harder to open up to a family member.
You two are always together.
But please take care of her.
All right.
I will.
I'll try.
You son of a bitch!
How dare you send a man to fight me?
Hey...
You think I'm using you?
Mr. President...
This is a big deal for us.
It's Hong Ra-ni's dream.
Are you insane?
You went to Dong Won-chang.
Don't cross the line again.
Hey...
Calm down.
That guy... No, that bastard...
He's trying to scam you.
You think panic attacks make me dumb?
You're the one who told me to look at things carefully, with love.
You poured your entire life into that character.
Right?
Hey...
Please listen to me.
I'll wait until I'm less busy.
Thanks for the porridge.
It was good.
Um, hello.
I'll show you what's happening.
The third audition...
I'll accept your offer.
Under one condition.
Don't interfere while I create my design sample.
These are important times for me.
The same goes for you.
So...
The third audition...
Excuse me.
What smell? I don't smell!
I have a headache!
Your smell will make the fruit rot!
Come on!
Don't tell me what to do!
Mr. Lee Seung-jin, this is Jang Min-kyung.
You've been avoiding my calls.
Are you out?
No.
The camera...
I'm Ku Ji-woo. We had dinner together.
Oh, right.
All right.
I found it!
This is so unfair.
These lyrics are great.
Crazy bastard.
It's not that.
Plus, I didn't film much.
So, don't worry.
Sounds great!
My sister's so talented.
- We never hug. - Stop it!
Mr. Seung-jin.
Mr. Seung-jin.
Please get up on stage.
You're here.
That must have been heavy.
Hello.
Fighting!
Let's see your design sample.
You'll never change.
How scary.
Business partners shouldn't treat each other that way.
No.
You don't like me, but you're still a professional.
You'll regret this.
Regret?
You still stink.
All I can film is the wall.
It's recording. Start talking.
I'm sure you're disappointed in me.
I'm sorry.
I should have looked carefully...
How happy it can feel.
I'm going to move forward, thanks to you.
You poured your heart into your song.
It was really good.
Pouring your heart into something is enough.
I don't know if I'll make it in time...
And...
No.92, your name is Lee Seung-jin?
but we could feel your love.
Pouring your heart into something is enough.
Thank you.
He's just leaving?
- Seung-jin! - Lee Seung-jin!
Let's do this!
Dorothy, be reasonable.
Whiskey it is. Whiskey, <i>ja.</i>
Adam and Eve?
The monster.
Instead of running away,
<i>Of course.</i>
I want you here. That's why I'm calling you.
It's just... Before, you didn't say--
I'm in terrible pain. I need medicine.
Papa--
Think of me for once, instead of her.
<i>Ja, Vater.</i>
There is an emergency.
and today you're leaving halfway through your third.
It's unavoidable. My father's in great pain and he needs me.
As do we!
With all respect,
does your father always get everything he wants?
Doctor, you as much as anyone
know the importance of my father's work,
- If you've a problem with it-- - The problem is yours.
It's called an attachment disorder.
Well...
thanks for the analysis.
Oh. So your daughter teaches.
Yes. She also had
a private psychoanalytical practice for children.
At first, I was afraid that by following in my footsteps,
Anna would leave no mark of her own.
I hoped that was my own narcissistic fear.
Oh, the tangled webs we weave...
when first we practice to deceive.
Yes, Anna's dedicated to the science.
- Why? Are you married? - No.
Oh. Do you live with someone?
A woman or a man?
Homosexuality is not immoral.
Why so?
Moral sense in a man is created by fear,
and that fear comes from
the castration complex.
- So women have nothing to fear? - Precisely.
Without this fear,
these impulses cannot be countered.
Then, how are they countered?
Through traditional relationships
with husbands and fathers.
You are a walking contradiction.
Well, I'm human.
I'm inherently flawed.
And I'm deeply damaged.
Anna?
You all right?
Yeah. It's nothing.
Tell me.
I have to find a chemist.
He has no one.
- Let's make some calls first. - I will find one on my way home.
Then we'll go together.
Absolutely not.
Bernbridge isn't wrong, you know.
Yes.
And what else?
Doesn't smoking aggravate your mouth?
Mm-hmm.
It does.
But I'm determined
to relish and revel in the only sexual pleasure left, right?
Extraordinary. We've been talking this long,
and this is the first mention of sex.
Bravo. Well observed. Yes.
But I think...
The infant sucking on its mother's breast.
Ah. Took you less than a minute to bring God into sex.
Fascinating.
But despite your church propaganda,
Progress?
We've gone from sex being the subject never spoken of
to our not being able to talk of anything else.
Well, perhaps we did. <i>Ja.</i>
Yes, psychoanalysis is inherently sexual.
Oh, yes, we infantilize it, turning it into the lie
that sex under any circumstances is perfectly normal and healthy.
running through the Old and New Testaments:
sex is to be shared between two people
who are committed to each other.
Well done. Good.
<i>Ja,</i> a bestiary. An encyclopedia of it.
Help me tie these apron strings, will you?
<i>Ja,</i> a bestiary.
<i>Ja.</i>
Where's my cigar? I left a cigar somewhere. Um...
you always pick and choose those special Bible verses,
the ones that support your own virtuous bias.
Isn't that correct?
It's ridiculous.
sadistic cruelty, really.
with a great orchestra,
<i>Ja.</i> Put these things in the sink.
They aren't going to wash themselves, are they?
would cause women to give up sex completely,
especially as you say homosexuality isn't immoral.
Well, perhaps lesbianism is different.
Perhaps unchecked, it becomes progressively more unstable.
No, their conditions have a different source.
I don't understand.
Her father.
And what about your father?
Ah! It's too late to turn back now.
My father and I...
Now, there's an interesting tale.
Uh,
made our peace before he died.
He was...
a good man.
<i>Ja?</i>
he made up for financially.
Warnie, we call him. We call him Warnie.
Just your brother?
It's complicated.
<i>Ja.</i>
Mm.
I suppose I should have some starlet's pic.
It's just me mum.
There goes dinner.
Lewis,
make me a promise.
If something happens to me,
And if anything happens to you,
That's an order.
So, how much of that day do you remember?
Little to none. I was...
It was chaos from the outset.
<i>It was my last time over the bags.</i>
<i>Paddy and I made it into no-man's-land.</i>
Jack!
Jack! Jack, we can't stay here!
Hel...
Help!
Well, I was going to take you out dancing.
Mrs. Moore?
I'm so sorry.
Right.
The letters you wrote to me after Paddy's death,
they keep me close to him.
He carried this with him.
The shrapnel that killed him,
It's too close to my heart to remove it.
Now, Jack, um,
we need to talk about something quite serious.
You told me about the promise
I might look ancient to you, but--
No, you...
Quite the opposite.
The right reply.
Or depending on anyone but myself.
Let's not look at it like a guardianship then.
Let's call it a friendship.
Agreed.
<i>A friendship.</i>
Your friend's mother.
I wouldn't call it a relationship.
Any bond between two people is a relationship.
Mrs. Moore was in her early 40s.
Oh. Hmm.
Does Mrs. Moore have a first name?
Janie. Ooh.
Tell me, did you find Janie an attractive woman
- when you first met her? - She was my friend's mother.
Often, men who lose their mothers at an early age
are drawn to more mature women.
I resent the implication,
and my personal life is really not your concern.
- Oh, really? - Mm.
It fascinates me.
<i>Ja.</i>
You lived with her, with Janie,
or your battle trauma
My private life is precisely that. Yes.
As you wish.
Hmm.
But I consider what people tell me far less interesting
than what they choose not to tell me.
Well, bully for you.
Let me.
Hello. Can I help you?
No one can today, I'm afraid.
Is Miss Freud in?
No, I'm afraid not. No. She's--
Hi, Ernest.
Dr. Ernest Jones.
I should leave you to your doctor.
He's not my physician.
I'll take a walk around, get some air. Yes.
That's good.
Take Jofi with you.
Come in.
Right.
Yes. Thank you.
There we go.
So, Ernest, to what do I owe the honor?
a first-rate psychoanalytic facility
being established in a town called Bury.
It's near Manchester.
- No. No, no. - Oh.
I was thinking about Anna.
Oh, <i>ja?</i>
- She'd be safer there. <i>- Ja.</i>
That's one thing.
What's the other?
Well, they've asked me to join the faculty.
Oh, <i>ja?</i>
Ah.
What do you think?
Please. My father's having a medical crisis.
He needs help immediately.
The sex doc?
Has Anna given you any indication
No, I've, I've spent...
very little time with her socially.
<i>- Ja?</i> - I just think she would
only benefit from a...
a wider circle of professional and personal acquaintances.
Besides myself?
No, of course not.
Well, perhaps we could
That's not necessary.
I can speak with her then?
No.
- Can I ask why? - Yes.
Anna and I have an understanding
that she will not consider any relationship
until we both feel it is suitable.
You're 20 years older than Anna, she's still a young girl.
any sexual feelings. That's why.
Sigmund.
What?
What are you...
What are you saying, Sigmund?
Anna spent years in treatment for, for a complex.
A complex which proves
from an unhealthy paternal attachment.
Go!
That was 20 years ago.
Please wait here.
Dr. Schur.
It's Anna Freud.
I need your help.
- Anna. - All the chemists are closed.
I had nowhere else to go. He needs his medicine.
Come in.
Thank you.
<i>Dorothy. Perhaps next week.</i>
<i>Thank you, Dr. Freud.</i>
Don't.
What could I possibly ask?
My therapy sessions are mine alone.
You do look a bit flushed.
I wonder what you could've talked about.
And I could say the same of you, having me so close.
Very convenient.
Everything to do with you and nothing at all.
So then he knows.
He knows.
<i>Sophie, look how he's walking.</i>
Sophie, look at him walking.
Let's try it one more time.
Oh, yeah, those can fly.
Yes.
Huh. He's inescapable.
This way, Jofi.
- Has Jofi finished walking you? - Yes.
Come on. <i>Komm zu Papa.</i>
Jofi.
Sorry. I thought he'd...
<i>Ja.</i>
<i>Ja.</i>
Hey! I want to show you something!
Give me a hand. Thank you.
- Do you know Momus? - Momus? No.
Momus is a god.
The Greek god who chastised all the other gods of Olympus.
for their absurd, their stupidity.
So they banished him.
To live with humanity.
<i>- Ja.</i> - Familiar theme.
<i>Ja.</i>
He became the sad god.
What would you call a confirmed nonbeliever
I am a passionate disbeliever
Right and wrong, good and evil, choice between them.
<i>- Ja.</i> - Yeah.
<i>Ja.</i>
I need more handkerchiefs.
So, what were we saying? Yes...
And your God, who created good, or whatever that is,
<i>Ja?</i>
He allowed Lucifer to live. He let him flourish.
But, logically, he should have destroyed him.
Am I correct?
Think about it.
God gave Lucifer free will,
which is the only thing that makes goodness possible.
A world filled with choiceless creatures
who created prisons and slavery and...
What?
<i>Ja,</i> I hear you, I'm not deaf.
So is that your excuse
Or is killing me God's revenge for my disbelief?
Professor Lewis, I am shocked. I am shocked.
I don't know and I don't even pretend to. It's...
perfectly happy. But we're not. We're not.
So, God...
God lacks goodness.
Or power.
Or both. I don't know.
Well, finally, finally, finally.
We're making progress.
Make us realize that happiness,
real happiness, eternal happiness,
If... If pleasure is his whisper,
pain is his megaphone.
Oh, <i>ja.</i>
Yes.
Well, I'm sure that
the cherubic little altar boy, Adolf Hitler,
who served in his church every Sunday morning,
I'm sure he'd agree with you. <i>Ja.</i> Absolutely. Totally.
I'm afraid I cannot agree with you.
We speak different languages.
You know, you believe in revelation. Fine.
There's no common ground.
Why does religion make room for science,
but science refuses to make room for religion?
Oh, please. You're breaking my heart.
How capacious and comfortable
that the sun does not move around the world,
Precisely! 'Cause they hide behind their ignorance.
'Cause we're human.
and our confidence in ourselves.
<i>Ja,</i> I'll show you something.
That was...
That was my daughter.
Sophie.
She was a mother.
And a wife.
And my little grandson.
He was plucked from us.
Killed by tuberculosis at the age of five.
Five years.
<i>Ja.</i>
to kill a little boy.
I'll tell you something.
so that I could hallucinate God
and seek my bloody vengeance on him.
Bloody hypocrites!
And that is God's plan?
We are on horseback.
His family hates mine.
He's avenging them.
I cannot escape.
The knight is coming closer. Closer.
Then he kisses me...
His face to mine.
His lips near my lips,
red and dripping.
He whispers...
"Tell me your family secrets."
How advanced is your cancer?
It is inoperable.
How much time?
and it is a sin.
- It is. <i>- Ja.</i>
Look in there.
You see, hell's already arrived.
She shares your superstitions.
Anna?
Anna? No, she knows I'm going to die, <i>ja.</i>
That you're planning to kill yourself?
No. Why should I cause her pain?
'Cause I'm tired.
Yes,
actually.
It's all right.
<i>- Is Anna married?</i> <i>- No.</i>
I'm surprised.
You mean for Anna to choose.
Dr. Jones today...
Dr. Ernest Jones?
Yes. He asked to see Anna, not you.
He did?
Yes.
But why would she need a mate
Man, woman, both?
Please call later.
-We have the stage in five minutes.
-Give me your phone. -She won't answer.
Let's go.
-Today, a huge crowd is eager to hear me.
(sighs) But as I face that crowd today,
I go back in time.
When I was alone.
Very alone...
(kids booing) When I screamed in silence.
Because I was alone then.
Very, very alone.
It's in loneliness that it all ends.
And it's in loneliness where it all begins.
It's into my loneliness that you first walked in.
But I'm still very alone. Even amidst a crowd.
So, I still look for you.
I find myself when I look into your eyes.
As I dive into your eyes, I keep losing myself.
'6 YEARS AGO'
Boss, ready to go?
And listen. Is the catering staff here? Go, check downstairs.
We organized this whole thing. -...I can try.
We have some good options.
Dense clouds of monsoon
From far Mathura Comes a garland of 'charu' flowers
-Hey, Anwesha. This way! -Hi!
Dense clouds of monsoon
From far Mathura Comes a garland of 'charu' flowers
Yet...
Arpan, who’s this guy?
Aveek Sanyal. Sings at a small bar called Moonlight.
-(smirking) He's showing off just to impress the crowd.
Not talent, lack of schooling.
Ahem… sorry.
Everything isn't meant for everyone.
This is not your place. -Sorry. Sorry...
Dense clouds of monsoon
Comes a garland of 'charu' flowers
Dense clouds of monsoon
From far Mathura Comes a garland of 'charu' flowers
Yet the one I love The one with the golden skin
He didn't come
Oh, beloved How do I make it up to you?
-Wow!
-Excellent! -Brilliant.
Let's go.
Like the river Yamuna...
-Why did you do that? Let's go.
-Ah! -Hi, looking for someone?
Um, Aveek… Aveek Sanyal.
-Evening? -But… he hasn't come recently.
Something happened at a party. So-- -I too was there.
-Oh? So, what happened there? -Why? I'll tell you later...
Not over phone, in person. May I? -You've to travel 2.5 kms for that.
-Fine. Come on then. -Me? Are you crazy?
Really? Your bar is swarming with customers now, isn't it?
-I have a scooty. -So, what?
-There! -My job's done, over to you.
-Just call him, will you?
Hey-- Please... -It's urgent.
Aveek, hey, Aveek!
Hey!
Stop… listen!
Phew!
Hi!
Hello?
My friend Aditya randomly said those judgmental things to you
I thought I must explain on his behalf or you'll misunderstand.
Because I did nothing for you.
I know I am ranting.
You see, I've always been a blabbermouth.
I've wanted to be a journalist always. Damn, digressing again.
Honestly, I’m really, really sorry, on behalf of Aditya.
You okay?
-Then why don’t you say something? Say something? Anything!
What’s with your collar!
Trust me, I'd understand if you can't forgive me.
I mean me and Aditya.
It’s alright, happens.
What do you mean ‘happens’? How can you even say that?
Oops, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Anwesha.
I’m… Aveek.
-Okay-- -See you later.
-Wait!
-What is that? -What?
-That one. Show me. -My ledger book.
Return it. It's-- -Shut up.
S*it! -'I write songs in ledger books
Be warned, it's absolute trash.
Of course you'll call it trash, so I can praise it later, right?
Read.
Window bars and prison locks, I can't break either.
Dude!
Dude… -What do you mean ‘dude’?
You can't write that stuff unless you're in love!
Love is like a ghost to me.
Anyway, I’ve wasted enough of your time... Sorry again.
I’m sorry too.
Tell your friend, I’ll think twice before I dare try Classical again.
See you.
Alright...
Okay! Bye?
Done?
Won’t you drop me back? You promised!
What about the helmet?
Hmm...
What's going on?
Hmm?
Your face is red, eyes are sparkling.
-You’re wrong, I’m off. -You're not going anywhere.
Straight to the bar now.
-Reading too much into it. -And it always works.
Someone's scooting right through the lanes of your heart right now.
-What is this sob music? Sing something peppy!
It’s hard Pretending to be happy
My feelings wish to run free
I sing the song of false love
As I look for the real you
All this distance between us
You're beyond all of it
My songs are dead
In the reasons given by you
Does it really matter?
My songs will address Their love for you
It’s hard Pretending to be happy
My feelings wish to run free
I sing the song of false love
As I search for the real you
All the distance between us
You're beyond it all
My songs are dead
In the reasons given by you
-Aveek...
Weird?
Well, you come to the lake and feed the ducks for hours.
Don’t you get bored?
They are far simpler than humans. We are friends now.
I mean, I’m really good at reading people.
-And--
You need a big hammer.
A hammer?
-He never had anyone to talk to. Maybe he's used to this now.
-He had you.
I understand him anyway. No talking needed.
Listen. -Hmm.
Yes! Go on!
-Teach me. -Teach you what?
-Let's see if it gives me inner peace too?
Go on.
-Why’re you laughing? -Trust takes time.
-Talking about me?
No, about the ducks.
It takes patience. -Ah.
Here, now try.
Look at them, living every moment.
That’s why they can fly.
-You have wings too, just not the will.
How long do you plan on hiding your songs?
I’ll count from one to ten. -Why?
-1… -They’ll fly away!
-2… -Wait!
No problem, there’s a solution.
-What solution? -Turn around… just turn!
What is this!
I’ve never done it this way!
Let’s go, now sing.
Sing!
6...
7, 8...
9...
10!
The reflection in my mirror
No matter how much I call out
The glass house I built breaks down
With your delicate touch
Even my mind and heart Are delicate, made of glass!
How about ice cream? -Um, why not!
-Alright I’ll get it, wait. -Really?
-Give me three butter-scotch ice creams.
So is Aditya! I’m going!
-No butter scotch, any other flavour?
Isn’t that your Tarapada Da?
-Pundit Haripada Ray. -Oops, sorry.
-As a kid, I’d shut myself in the room to listen to his songs.
Such difficult songs to sing...
But he sang them so simply, like a friend telling a tale.
Fan-boy eh!
I too will have a poster on the streets in a cool jacket!
You just keep thinking.
-(sighs) -Let's introduce you to someone.
-Who? -Just come!
Come on! -But who is it?
Dad!
Come!
Come!
Where's your ticket?
-I was just– -No ticket? Get lost!
It's okay, come.
Dad, meet Aveek. My friend and a huge fan of yours.
-Hey, bless you.
Aveek sings at a ba--
I mean restaurant. He writes songs too.
-No... -No?
-Listen Aveek,
Your songs tell your own story. How can you forget them?
Whatever you have within, just unleash it all. Sing.
In your silence Lay a thousand questions
In your silence Lay a thousand questions
Wow!
Everything isn't learnt in a class. Have any more questions?
No Pundit Ji, I find all my answers in your songs.
Take care.
You're such a…
Could hardly breathe! You never told me he’s your dad!
-As if you tell me everything? -Anu...
What took you so long? I thought you’ll miss the show!
-Of course, you know each other! -Hmm.
I see!
Watch the show.
Totally blew it.
See you.
Please move. One ticket please.
-You can't cut the queue!
My beloved I can't bear the pain of distance
My beloved I can't bear the pain of distance
I cannot express How I feel
I cannot express How I feel
My beloved I can't bear the pain of distance
In what way?
In what way Shall I overcome this suffering?
-Bachhu, chili chicken for table six.
Where were you all day, huh?
Haven't seen you around...
You don't know how to. Give me--
-Leave it! -A neat peg!?
Hey! Add some water!
Hey!
See, told you so!
Sit down, come on!
Drink some water. Hey... No...
The reflection in my mirror
No matter how much I call out
The glass house I built breaks down
With your delicate touch
Even my mind and heart Are delicate, made of glass
I wish to get you back I extend my arms
I wish to get you back I extend my arms
Just a drunkard, don’t hype him up.
Your indie films are all about this!
Pick people off the road, make them famous! So, get him!
Good publicity, also cheap. What else do you need?
-Oh, come on.
Like hot steam, it burns
This sorrow piled up like dirt
Of the high that comes from pain
Even my heart, the times Are delicate, made of glass
I am intoxicated by you
Aveek!
-What was that?
You ran away!
-Will you zip it? -Shut up!
-Let her speak. Please go from here.
Fine. But tell me if you want to throw up.
Anyway people come here to get high, not to listen to you.
Shh!
Eyes of a jeweler you see! Found a pearl inside the shell.
Bless you.
-I don't really-- -Guru Ji, I’ll be back.
I don’t teach music really.
Let’s start from the top?
Guru Ji, I’ll return when this ordeal is done.
Can't waste my time every day.
Come, dear Radhe...
Aveek, wherever you go,
whatever you do, hold onto your music tightly.
Music will never leave your side.
With your Guru's--
-Anu! Happy birthday. Thought I forgot, didn’t you?
Thank you!
-Yes, Guruji, let's go. -Come.
Keep it there.
You all gather here. -Place the cake here, please.
-All gather on that side. -Anu, hope you like the gifts.
You were never mine
Even then Here I come, again
You were never mine
Even then Here I come, again
Without you
I’m barely alive
But you live with me
-Dear Anwesha,
even if I can't be yours, my songs will remain yours.
If nothing else, just answer this one question of mine.
Why do we always love, the ones who’ll never be ours?
-Gave her the letter?
Bye!
-You have money to enjoy yourself! But not for me?
-You are always drunk, always!
-Mind your tongue! Or-- -Or what?
Happy?
What are you staring at?
-Ma, listen! -Damn, my life!
-Ma, open up!
Ma? Open up!
-Shut up! Isn't he your responsibility too?
-Damn him! It's you who wanted him! I never wanted a son!
I would've dumped him in trash! -Careful, he'll hear us!
-Fine, I will!
Gave it a thought?
Dad, please… It's--
-Look, you're getting older, So am I…
And Aditya really…
Aditya may be a prodigy…
But how someone sings, can't tell you how a person is.
Sometimes, I really worry.
You know, Dad...
When I close my eyes, I see myself in a newsroom…
As a successful journalist.
Not as someone’s bride…
And what about love?
Does that concept suit you?
It's been a week since Aveek stopped attending the classes.
Good, very good.
What you are thinking... It's not practically possible.
So, what am I thinking? Tell me?
-See... Aveek, sings at a bar…
-Hmm. -Yes, so--
-Dreams, you see! Dreams!
You surely know, Dreams are our biggest capital.
But dad,
what if someone refuses to dream?
-Hmm, then I have one thing to say.
Do not dream about someone, who doesn’t have dreams.
Brought you coffee.
Hey!
Even turned Deb away. Why? What’s wrong with you?
Whatever you wish to tell!
Look at you!
Hey...
What’s the point of being angry with me?
Deb told me everything.
Rubbish.
No time for love.
I have been your age Aveek,
I understand.
I know,
seeing your father after ages may have stirred up memories but...
Aveek!
And you?
-Hi! -Hi.
You have... something to say?
No…
Um, yes.
You see... Um...
Look, I know that you are avoiding me and that’s fine.
Really, really close.
Just friends.
But you know what…
Um, I mean...
I feel like everything will be fine.
Since, we're friends-- Well, I know you don't feel anymore more.
But, I feel that…
Aveek.
Aveek?
There was no one for me
And I wasn’t anyone’s
I forget all my qualms
Only if you smile... once
Only if you love me... once
I find you
I keep looking at you
I lose myself in your eyes
But I've forgotten it all
When I lose myself
I keep looking at you
Drowning my eyes in yours
I forget all my qualms
Only if you smile... once
Only if you love me... once
I find you
I keep looking at you
I lose myself in your eyes
-Hello! -Hello... Hello! Uh...
I’m sorry, sorry...
-You're sorry? -No...
I... I can't do this.
-As in? -I cannot stay...
No... I just cannot stay!
I can't-- -Hello? Hello!
Sh*t!
Please try later.
IVR: The person you're calling is not answering.
Please try later.
You were never mine
Yet... I've come back again
You were never mine
Yet... I've come back again
Without you
I’m barely alive
Yet, you live on
Yet, my heart won't believe it
Yet, my heart won't believe it
For the I love I feel for you
Even without you
I don't belong to myself either.
Someone else will be your beloved. I have always been alone.
I'm quite content in my sorrow.
This sorrow shall stand beside me.
Yet, my heart won't believe it
-All okay? -Hmm.
Doesn't attend the classes... Lost his passion for learning?
He won't answer my calls.
You're a bad judge of people.
You're wasting away thinking of him all the time!
And stop the charity work!
Why are you defending Aveek like this?
I feel whatever you have isn't just friendship.
-Hello Anwesha, Arpan here.
I sent Aveek’s song to a music label.
They absolutely loved it.
Couldn't find him at the bar either. What should I do?
-Okay. Thank you.
Who was it?
What’s the point? Been 8 days of zero contact.
What are you gaining from hurting her?
And I think we must not stay in touch further."
That would hurt more!
Great plan! Huh!?
You wish to test if she will stick around.
Very different cases.
Stop bullsh*ting all the time.
-Not everyone is you. -And I'm telling you, call her!
-Answer it. -No.
-Listen to me, answer it. -No.
Talk to her! Give it to me!
-Don't answer it. -Shut up, let me talk.
Yes, right away. Okay. Yes, alright Anwesha di.
-Go! -Nope!
Go.
Watch it!
Go.
Didn't answer the call. Why have silly conversations?
-Aveek? -Like everyone else,
I’m not Aveek.
Don't hurl these dreams on me, please!
Aveek, isn’t it your dream?
Dream eh?
Right...
Here. Look. Have a look!
Can’t dream with an empty pocket. You won't get it!
Yeah...
It’s you who’s empty inside.
You feel nothing for anyone at all! All you feel...
is fear!
Aveek!
Yes, I'm your biggest mistake. And you're my biggest mistake!
-Aveek... Please, Aveek! -Please just go away!
Aveek...
What is this?
Get it altered! -Humans can’t be altered.
No...
-But...
-You look better with Aditya.
No alteration needed.
And you love him too.
You do...
You are right.
You're very right.
You are not Aveek. -No.
No...
I'm not him...
Anwesha?
Love didn’t win in the end eh?
It could have...
but your fear won.
All good?
Or like me, would you also have feared love?
I couldn't give you any answers.
Just left you with some questions.
If only you looked back once, you’d have all your answers.
Even then, I shall wait. Stretch out my arm in mere habit.
'PRESENT TIME' Aveek! Aveek!
I am wrong, but so are you
You keep changing With time
I'm absent, but so are you
Our conversations Linger in memories
Just for once Turn back, look at me!
Tell me, where can I find you?
I am silent, but so are you
Our dreams They shall burn to ashes
Just for once Turn back, look at me!
Tell me, where can I find you?
-Kuntal, check the wire. -The payment's come in.
-Hi! -Hello.
-Hi! -What a great show!
-Yes. -Of course.
-How was it? -Nice, very nice.
Our vocalist performs way better with you!
Really? First, ask her if she's okay with it. Weirdo!
Artists and their drama!
You must come everyday, Ma'am. And practice well.
I think you don’t have to address me formally.
You can be informal.
Even the heart needs music! Why don't you two go...
hang together! You know what I mean? Talk about music!
-I think that’s my cue. So, bye! -Will you avoid us today as well?
Binod da, we're busy. He'll send you the byte soon.
Listen to my songs. You'll know.
Classical music purists think you're fusion music is pretentious.
-They call you a sellout. -You're not even on social media!
-Is it all, a performance? -You even covet your personal life!
-All a gimmick? -Like you, I too perform.
Difference is, I don’t deny it.
Excuse me.
-Happy?
-Aveek Sanyal, a contemporary fusion artist
And the public considers this to be over-smart.
You know me since my songs lay in my journal, gathering dust.
Look,
Saying this as your manager.
Time we went big, right?
Thousands sing my love songs with me as I perform,
then I return to my lonely life, right?
No offense taken.
And you're 15 minutes late to the meeting.
Anwesha, this is not done.
-I’m sorry ma’am. I understand.
Aveek Sanyal’s first, exclusive, camera interview.
But ma’am, Aveek--
He doesn't give interviews. -I know. Make it happen.
You’re from Kharagpur, right?
Using my personal connections isn't--
Please leave now.
-I don't know how he'll react.
-And if you fail, you know how Niharika ma'am will react.
-The way the media is misinterpreting Aveek…
I feel there's more to it! -I've reached, talk later.
You?
I mean, what are you doing here?
Aveek was contacted by our channel for an interview.
I know you declined the offer.
What would you like? Some beer and fish fry?
Deb, I had a request-- -Anwesha di, that can't happen.
Look, we can share the questions beforehand.
This is a professional matter, Deb.
I hope you understand.
Say something? -What can I say?
he is still a mess.
I know you’ve moved on after that fateful night,
your life changed a lot. But…
he couldn’t do it.
He is still stuck there.
Sorry, I can’t.
Alright then.
It's your friend's nature to escape.
No matter how much I call out I can't find myself there
My heart and mind Are delicate, made of glass
I wish to--
Stop it.
That man's pic on the wall...
He believed that 'ragas' are like prayers.
Sit down!
Raag Studio Session's first episode!
Aveek Sanyal!
A million views guaranteed!
-Easily! -I haven’t sung this song before.
I’m not sure. -Listen, brother.
Heartbreak is a subject that public devours endlessly.
And you've the image of a heartbroken tragic hero.
Got it? -You think I can do this?
What, eh?
Tell me this,
forget a decade, you think my music will last 5 years?
Brother, the world has changed.
People don’t want a hero anymore.
Cheer up!
-Who? -She!
She... Hey, what?
Let's go then? Oh, come on, let's go!
Hi!
I’m a huge fan of yours.
So am I.
-Hello? -Hello?
Sir, this is Joyeeta from News Story.
We tried to contact your manager for an interview a few times.
-Don't waste your time, please. -(whispering) Ask!
-Uh, sir, a struggling artist who sings at a bar for money
-Your music speaks for itself! -But my story is very uneventful.
People want ordinary yet honest stories now.
Hello, sir? -Fine, I'll let you know.
Don't disappoint them at least?
-Hmm.
Aditya sir... ?
You see, Aditya Sen is recording on the other studio floor. So...
Apologies, sir.
In a stranger You seek shelter today
You seek me In new lovers
A bridge of memories Sway your heart
Oh, how well you hide the wounds With your smile
Oh, how well you hide the wounds With your smile
You paint yourself A picture of an unknown peace
Our fairy tale is pointless Yet you keep your word
Oh, how well you hide the wounds With your smile
Oh, how well you hide the wounds With your smile
Without my beloved I can't go on
Sleep eludes me without you
Oh, my dear beloved
My heart flails in agony
Oh, dear love of mine
Without my beloved I can't go on
Throwing me my own wisdom.
I was wondering-- -Wondering what?
-Nothing.
You’re the one who says I should be content with less.
-Don’t play manager with me.
Tell me what you had in mind? Be open.
Listen, I may talk less. But I don't talk rubbish.
You can have faith.
That’s not what I meant. Listen!
In your silence Lay a thousand questions
In your silence Lay a thousand questions
I keep the memories safe In my heart
I cry alone My face dumped in my hands
I keep the memories safe In my heart
I cry alone My face dumped in my hands
'Aveek da will do the interview. You win.'
Aveek is here, he’s getting ready.
Anwesha Ray, I mean...
Anwesha Sen is here.
No need.
After a long time, yes.
Hi…
Hello.
Congratulations.
Do you love someone?
Huh? -Didn't invite me to the wedding?
-God!
Alright, okay.
Five minutes!
Yes, don’t worry.
He’s ready.
Um…
-That’s nothing to worry about it.
-Anyway…
We've to cancel the interview.
Raag Studio decided not to telecast it.
Listen, they have canceled the interview.
Didn't tell us the reason.
What! Why?
They’re scared of backlash.
If they drop Aveek, we are bound to follow. No big deal.
I lost you once before.
That I'd lose my hope to find you again, I didn't realize it.
-What are you doing?
What, really?
I'll be answerable to your mom if something happens to you.
You’ve nothing to say...
Things get canceled all the time.
What you’re doing is nothing but blo*dy drama!
Are you offended? -That's personal.
You’re my manager, stay that way.
Or you'd have taken to the streets, drank all the money away!
But she won't!
She won’t, damn it!
And listen, I’m yelling at you because I love you.
I'm saying it to your face! But you?
Forget it!
You don't even know how to yell back properly yet!
I can’t do it anymore.
I just can't.
Got it?
You’re on your own now.
I had an interview last month. May crack it.
I’m letting you know.
Why?
I'm going for more money and respect.
the audience and their choices are changing. Great.
They shall now perform folk music before you.
and offer my tribute to my Guru, Pundit Haripada Ray.
Aditya.
You can't speak like that, don't misuse my dad's legacy!
What's bothering you? That they cut short the list you made?
Look, they don't prefer your music anymore.
So, whose music do they prefer?
Your Aveek Sanyals?
Throwing in some Indian Classical style in songs, damn show-off!
Is that even music? -Why bring in Aveek here?
your Guru, my dad... It was from the streets that he came up too--
-Please, Anwesha! Don't comment on what you don't understand.
There were many girls, believe me.
But I chose you.
You left for Mumbai after our marriage.
I was there. I supported you!
All that, just to land a job at a local Bengali channel.
-Please! Save your piddling speech for Aveek Sanyal.
You too used him quite well.
Feels nice to get attention from a stray dog, isn’t it?
What?
Go ahead.
I won’t sing at this concert.
Smoke?
Once their masks fall off, all men are the same.
Without your mercy
Without your mercy How can I serve you, Lord?
But now I feel like music too will abandon me like everyone else.
I see now, you were right.
like his thumris.
Lalon Fakir, too, is alone. Just like you are I are... alone.
No one will remember you, but you!
So, when everyone leaves you, remember to stand by yourself."
Humans are fundamentally alone.
Embrace it.
Without your mercy, Lord How can I serve you?
-Rainy evenings by the window, or a chilly afternoons...
Aveek Sanyal!
Aveek has returned home after five long years!
Aveek, none other than our Minati’s son.
Aveek…
Secretly, I look for you
On streets, alleys
I share my story with you in vain
Among the sea of unknown faces
I lose sight of you
I restrict my laughter My zest for life
Don't know the reason
I’m not present anywhere I live with hesitation
I don’t understand why
No one is my own to call
Wounds don't stay hidden forever
I can't be stopped
My heart is not here, in this land
It's not for me
My heart is not here, in this land
It's not for me
Unsaid words turned to To ashes now
Why am I burning myself In this smoke?
My soul is a wanderer But I'm home-bound
These alleys, these shadows That I left behind
That’s how I survive
Wonder when I will see you again?
When will I lose myself again?
In my heart, I believe
Not a soul is my own to call
Wounds don't stay hidden forever
I can't be stopped
My heart is not here, in this land
The city too feels very lonely
It's not for me
My heart is not here, in this land
The city too feels very lonely
It's not for me
-Here, they gifted this to you.
-Wow, so pretty.
-No, I'll go home and eat. -No!
I mean, we've arranged for lunch packs here.
I'll get you one. -Wait. A lunch pack? Why?
You're just fleeing.
But Ma...
Believe me,
I am doing fine.
Working on expanding the school.
Do something...
Come over and sing to them sometimes.
-You too are pushing me away.
Don't say that!
Never!
Do call me.
And if you feel like crying...
Like you did as a kid.
IVR: The person you're trying to reach,
is not available to answer right now.
Please try later.
Damn.
-Sorry. -What?
Missed that, louder please?
-Hmm.
I know your whereabouts way before you do.
She turned you away too?
That day, you were speaking about... Anwesha–
-Anwesha again!
This too shall pass.
You think?
It will.
I told you earlier.
Listen, I couldn't tell you. You've a new gig, talk to them.
I can't do it. I'll send it to you. Discuss the financials.
Okay?
-You haven't changed a bit, eh? -As if you have!
-Who? -Is she still there?
So she's still there eh?
You've a long life!
-Listen, I’m– -It's okay.
No.
Doesn’t matter, I’ve lots of options.
-Do you?
You know huh?
See you on stage.
I mailed my resignation.
You've changed a lot since Aveek's interview got canceled.
Apparently you and Aveek were just friends...
But I don't want to define what we had.
But you know,
I should've fought for Aveek back then.
I ran away.
You don’t even know this new Aveek...
The most special and...
Come, come now!
-Dearest Aveek.
You once asked me, if I was in love with Aditya.
-Anwesha?
-apparently he is lost.
And I am too late it seems.
And though I've much to say I'm out of time.
hold your hand and tell you…
I mailed my resignation to the HR.
When’s your flight?
The flight's tomorrow.
I’ve to be somewhere tonight.
Aveek?
Why do you seek answers that you won’t get? You know it.
I’ve decided.
I will resign from everything that doesn’t make me happy.
What’s the rush?
There’s no rush.
and inform you the rest?
Hmm?
I’m sorry, for everything.
I’ll be on my way.
Learn to love yourself first, Aditya.
My heart knows What you really are
I watch in wonder As all my loved ones leave
But I'm used to living alone It's a habit now
I'm sure to forget your name In time
I bid you farewell
I bid you farewell
Farewell to all happy memories With you
If you love You're scared no more
My heart knows What you really are
But I'm used to living alone It's a habit now
-Aveek...
Just wanted to say one thing.
Will you please meet me... once?
You answered them Through our void
I still stay with you Like a long lost tale
You answered them Through our void
I still stay with you Like a long lost tale
Days go by Immersed in your dreams
In my heart I keep My precious sorrows, safely
On this night When I can choose to forget it all
I hold onto your hand, tightly Even now
Days go by Immersed in your dreams
In my heart I keep My precious sorrows, safely
On this night When I can choose to forget it all
I hold onto your hand, tightly Even now
Minato?
A fire, a fire.
Minato?
Come look.
It's a fire.
Don't fall.
Who told you that?
My teacher, Mr. Hori.
They teach weird stuff these days That's not a human being, listen...
It started.
Go for it!
Not so loud.
Go for it!
Wait.
Wait, wait.
Your water bottle!
The bottom kids support gymnastic formations, so hang in there.
Off you go.
Over the white line, you go to hell.
You still are.
Excuse me.
Yes, welcome.
Welcome I'll take care of it.
I just passed it, and it was completely burned.
Well, you know,
There was a hostess bar on the third floor Did you know?
I saw a girl in short skirt handing out tissues to promote it.
Mr. Hori was there.
A teacher in a hostess bar...
Word gets around fast about something like that.
I'm tired.
Minato?
Sorry, I'll make dinner right away.
What? Oh, no, what the...
What are you doing?
- What, what? - I'm naked.
Against school rules.
Was it Kamata? Did he say something again?
What the hell is this?
- Hello. - Manager, customer.
I'm home.
<i>Here goes,</i>
<i>Happy birthday, dear Father.</i>
Enough.
Blow them out.
Give him an update.
About school and about your friends.
He was cremated first, so there was no dirt.
Is he already reborn?
Then I wish he'd come see us.
Like a giraffe?
I prefer a horse.
and he could give us rides.
Give him an update.
Got it.
What is it?
Will you be OK?
Time to get up and get ready.
OK?
An experiment.
For Science.
Wait for me, I'm hungry!
What?
Minato?
Who's the monster?
Who's the monster?
Minato?
- Who's the... - Minato!
Minato!
Sorry.
Your ear hurt?
be like Dad.
Your father was much worse.
He was a rugby player.
He'd come home with a complex fracture like it was no big deal.
But I've promised your father.
That I'll hang in there until you're married and have your own family.
Just an ordinary family you see anywhere is fine.
Minato?
Minato!
Mugino Minato.
Let's go.
Come in.
Please, come in.
You'll be fine.
Can't we get the car back?
Don't worry.
Mom, did you...
see the X-rays?
The CT scan? Sure.
Everything looked normal.
Oops, I'm in hell.
You're really fine.
Nothing's wrong with you.
What's up?
Did something happen at school?
That you're a slow eater?
Why did you cut your hair?
Why did you lose your sneaker?
What happened here?
It's a pig's brain My brain was switched with a pig's.
That's what's strange about me,
I'm a monster...
Who told you that?
Was it Kamata? It was Kamata, right?
Who told you that!
Minato, who told you that!
Who said that?
Mr. Hori.
- Bye. - Bye.
Principal...
Bye.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His gym bag was thrown down the hall,
He's told me these things.
Yes.
His ear was pulled so hard it bled.
He said, "Mr. Hori, stop, it hurts,".
Yes.
Sorry we're late.
Ms. Mugino, it's been awhile I was his second grade...
Mr. Kanzaki, hello.
And now?
I teach first graders...
That must be tough.
A war zone.
Please sit down.
Please.
- Please share your concerns. - I just explained to the principal...
The principal has pressing business.
The principal recently
No.
<i>Ouch!</i>
<i>Ouch! What, what?</i>
<i>My skin's super supple!</i>
Super supple!
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY
We've kept you waiting.
Regarding
the concerns that you shared with us,
Stand up.
In this case, because my instruction,
toward Mugino, to Mugino,
resulted in a misunderstanding
I feel most regretful.
I do formally apologize.
And, so?
Please, please wait.
You see,
Please sit down.
My son...
was wounded by his teacher's cruel remark.
It wasn't a misunderstanding.
What instruction?
May I confirm, Mr. Hori?
Mr. Hori!
You were violent towards my son, right?
It seems there was a misunderstanding.
There was no misunderstanding...
Do you understand?
So,
Now.
Now!
We have confirmed
that there was contact
There was contact between the hand and the nose.
The hand?
And the nose contacting like this?
Twisting his arm,
Candy?
Why's he eating candy?
Do you,
This is typical of single mothers like mine, so I know...
Mr. Hori.
What about single mothers?
Mr. Hori.
You'll get scolded.
What are you doing!
Hurry, go pick it up.
What are you doing?
I dropped my eraser.
- Hello. - Hello.
Now! Confirm them now! I mean, I'm asking.
Well...
At this rate, I'll have to transfer him to another school.
You were a good teacher.
On parents' day in second grade, Minato read his composition.
That his dream was to become a single mother.
I think he wrote that
because I raise him alone and he wanted to help me.
Everyone in his class burst out laughing.
But you didn't laugh.
"Be kind to your mother,"
is what he said while praising Minato.
You don't have a human heart!
I'm sorry...
That's not it.
Please have Mr. Hori come here.
Unfortunately he's out
I just saw him over there.
Principal, you just lied to me.
When a teacher is out, it doesn't mean he's not at school...
Get it together!
You know...
Yes.
Can you please answer my question?
About whether we're human?
No.
Fine, just answer that.
You have to check your notes?
We're human.
In that case,
I'm here because I'm worried about my child.
Just for this meeting,
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
She's here now...
Let's go over there.
- Fine, I'll apologize. - It's not...
I'm very sorry.
Make him quit.
What are you saying?
Mugino Minato is bullying Hoshikawa Yori.
- There's no evidence. - Mr. Hori, take it back.
Oh, I know.
You set fire to that bar You're the arson?
DO NOT ENTER.
You really did it.
Watermelon.
It happens, it does.
A release.
Yes?
You're Hoshikawa?
Yes.
Hoshikawa Yori?
Yes.
You're Minato's friend, right?
Yes.
Please.
Please, come in.
Please.
This looks like Minato's sneaker.
Yeah, he loaned it to me.
Just the one.
Won't she get mad, letting a stranger in your house?
It's fine.
Yeah...
Write a letter?
Like we write to kids out sick.
How is
your cold?
Listen,
We are all worried
about...
Yori, here,
Here.
Thank you, say, this...
What happened?
Yori,
are you being bullied at school?
I've never been bullied by Mugino.
- What are you saying... - And Mr. Hori...
OK, thanks, let's go back to class.
He's always hitting Mugino.
What is that?
- Let's go back to class. - Back to class.
Hoshikawa?
Don't run away, Principal.
You lost your grandchild, didn't you?
I heard about it.
Your husband was parking his car
and ran over your grandchild behind the car.
Did it make you grieve?
That's exactly how I feel now.
Good morning.
Saori, Saori.
You've had it rough.
Unfortunately,
something happened that should never have happened.
Mr. Hori.
I hit Mugino's face I twisted his arm
Good bye.
Let's go
Mr. Hori? Why's he here?
Didn't he quit?
Why's he here?
- Minato fell down the stairs. - Shut up, go home.
Eel keeper!
- Where is he? - Go home!
- The Guidance Counseling Room. - Eel keeper!
Minato?
What?
He was just here.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
It's OK.
Don't worry, it's fine.
Enough...
We're going, Gaku.
I saw Dad...
He asked me to tell you.
He said, "Thank you for everything, I love you".
Do you think Dad's reborn?
Maybe.
Yeah...
Don't talk like that.
Mom,
don't feel sorry for me.
Mugino!
Mugino!
Mugino!
Mugino!
MONSTER
What's wrong?
Let's get married.
That's a proposal, you're supposed to make it
Night view?
Everybody says it's beautiful, but it's just lightbulbs.
It's bad The whole thing's on fire.
Kamata, Hamaguchi, what are you doing?
- Stop filming me! - Girl from the hostess bar!
Burning crazy!
- Taking her home! - Gross!
It'll burn the whole building down.
Don't feel sorry for me.
It has swim bladder disease.
Don't be rude,
my mind and body are healthy.
Says someone whose hobby is sending letters about typos to publishers?
Look at this.
I wonder what "fish" fell from my eyes, a yellowtail or a sardine.
It makes me squirm with joy.
When you're having fun, your face is scary
I bet your students are put off, too.
Try smiling.
Your smile is so stiff, you'll make children cry.
And make flowers wilt.
It'll be fine.
not to trust a woman's "Next time" and a man's "It'll be fine?"
It'll be fine.
Next time, then.
Watch your hands, hey.
Corn soup and bread.
Soft noodles.
What's up, Hoshikawa?
Good morning, my shoe fell off.
Here.
Thank you.
You'd better be careful.
Hey, little eel.
Oh, Principal.
I am resuming my duties as of today.
Thank you for all of your kind notes while I was away.
I took time off just when you started teaching here.
Don't...
Please take good care of your students.
Yes.
"he joined Major League Baseball, I also declare.
"Practicing my swing on a West Coast beach,
"I've been reborn

No need to rush.
attended two weddings of women I once loved.
Sounds like a stalker when you say it.
Mugino, hey!
What are you doing?
Mugino, stop!
You OK?
Why do you do this?
Playing around?
Pissed off.
Pissed off?
How do you think they feel having their things thrown like this.
Don't like it.
Right?
Let's apologize to them.
I'm sorry.
My mom was, too.
She becomes overprotective with a shrewd perspective.
You're using "shrewd perspective" in the wrong way.
It actually means perceiving the essence of things...
When things are tough, don't take yourself so seriously.
- No. - See?
They're going to forget you, so don't take it too seriously.
- Shut up. - Don't say that
Second tier.
Hang in there, hang in.
Hang in.
OK, third tier!
Oh, hang in there, first tier Don't sway, second tier.
You call yourself a man?
Again, from the second tier
Ouch.
Mugino Minato's guardian is here to protest.
Protest what?
We can't let this get out of hand.
We're used to dealing with guardians, leave it to us.
Leave it.
I know that, but what does...
In the parents' meeting, did she say he'll test for middle school?
Yes, she did.
I didn't hit him My arm just grazed him.
I can explain that I stopped Mugino from acting out.
- Maybe all of us... - But actually...
Start over.
Because my instruction...
- Well... - No "Well" needed.
Can you see this?
Mr. Hori?
Mr. Hori?
In this case, because my instruction to Mugino...
The principal does love this school.
But still...
She lives in my neighborhood.
What?
but it was the principal herself.
Hoshikawa.
There they were Thank you, Mr. Hori.
Excuse me, I'm Hori I'm Yori's homeroom teacher.
His teacher.
Your college?
Excuse me?
I hear teachers don't get paid much.
Do you know Mega-City Real Estate?
I used to work there
I see, amazing.
It's not amazing, but
maybe for an elementary school teacher.
Um...
No good,
he's...
A monster.
What?
- Hello. - Hello.
Did you pee?
Who's the monster?
Are you OK?
Are you...
- Hoshikawa? - Oh, it's you, Mr. Hori.
Thanks.
- Hello. - Hello.
The cat?
I saw Mugino toying with the cat.
Hoshikawa?
- Hey, Hoshikawa? - No!
Kida, come here.
That Mugino might have killed the cat?
What? I never said that.
What...
- What are you doing! - Hurts.
Did everyone get a copy?
Return...
What is this?
What is this! What is this!
Ms. Mugino has hired a lawyer.
It arrived by certified delivery.
Bathroom, bathroom.
Really think about it.
And write down
your honest answer.
HAVE YOU EVER FELT AFRAID OF MR. HORI?
I really haven't done anything.
I'm sure.
In that case, please stop this.
If you object now, it will only strengthen their case.
Then why didn't you...
You are going to defend our school.
Let's go, Mr. Hori.
Who actually drove that car?
You're the principal, so to protect your position and your name,
you made your husband take the blame.
My apology would satisfy everyone.
So I had no choice and even apologized to Mugino.
But...
Have you been busy, recently?
Well, I still have some work to do later.
Good evening.
You're Mr. Hori, the teacher at Johoku Elementary, right?
I see you went shopping.
- I'm sorry. - Please stop that.
I'd like to interview you.
Please stop that.
I think they left.
Why the pajamas?
Even so, I'll be the only one in the newspaper
I'm sorry.
That hurt.
You know I'm innocent, right?
Pig's brain! Pig's brain!
It's Hori.
Mugino.
Mugino.
Mugino!
Mugino!
Why?!
I haven't done anything, right?
Yeah, right.
You OK?
- What happened? - Hori pushed him.
- Mr. Hori! - Mr. Hori!
Mr. Hori!
Mr. Hori, calm down!
Mr. Hori!

I was wrong!
You did nothing wrong!
There's nothing wrong with you!
Mugino!
Mugino!
Please, let me see Mugino.
Please.
Please!
Since he was little, he always woke up crying.
He always dreamed that the people he loved were gone and cried.
Um, wait...
A boy? No, I haven't.
There's an evacuation order Mudslide in the mountain.
Mudslide?

Hey!
Minato!
Hey!
- Minato?! - Mugino!
Hoshikawa!
she refused, saying,
"if I buy my favorite candy, the candy robber will come."
Candy robber?
So, I see.
Whatever I say, you say, "So, I see".
I just remembered, last night.
What about the grave?
You're right.
A candy robber, huh?
That's a great line.
Right?
Oh, this...
Thanks.
Stop, stop, it's dangerous!
<i>- Stop! - Please stop!</i>
<i>- It's Hoshikawa Yori. - It's not Hoshikawa.</i>
<i>Please stop!</i>
No, he doesn't.
- <i>Stop filming me!</i> - Girl from the hostess bar!
- Good morning. - Morning.
Midnight
2am for me
2am?
2am? What were you doing?
Do you ever think sleeping is a waste of time? No, right?
Bam!
Why are you talking to an alien?
- It's a prank! Surprised? - No.
- Sounds tasty. - I ate soft noodles.
Soft noodles.
What's up, Hoshikawa?
Good morning, my shoe fell off.
Out loud.
Our Future
I wrote this composition when I was in fifth grade.
- Who? - Which celebrity?
Oh, tambourines.
Mugino.
Here.
Kida, you're on music duty, right? Please go with him.
Hoshikawa is, too.
OK, Hoshikawa, take this.
Yes.
Please take this.
I don't think they're dirty.
You might catch my disease.
Just surprised you brought snacks.
What disease?
I told you.
Is your
We're friends, but...
Well, thanks.
Stinks, stinks.
Mugino, hurry, hurry.
Do it.
Do it more, more!
Keep doing it, more!
Keep doing it, more!
- I'll help you. - Thank you.
Don't just clean it up, react.
Hey, Hoshikawa.
Look at it!
- I'll take this. - Sure.
I can't say what I don't think.
A girl alien?
My lips are super supple!
Mugino...
Ouch.
Hurts.
No way, no way
I can't let you out.
Just stay there.
You can't.
What? Do you hear something?
A cat.
It's a prank.
Sorry for today.
Sorry for today.
Yeah.
- No way. - Never got a hot one?
I have.
Sorry, kept you waiting.
Let's go.
Primrose.
Blue star creeper.
Why do you know flower names?
Because I like them.
Kerria! Columbine!
White nettle, celandine.
That boys who know flower names are creepy?
You're right.
Girls don't like boys who are scared of the dark.
Let's go.
Will you tell?
All aboard!
Hello.
It's sunny here.
All aboard!
You put this here
Like this.
"The fa-ther said, 'No, but, then,
"he, said, OK,
"and la, laugh, laughed."
OK, next.
- Fujimori. - Yes.
- I made mistakes. - It's OK.
Look, it's here.
A cat.
Actually, a former cat.
That's true of everything that dies.
Left like this, it might not be reborn.
Cover its face with dirt, too?
It's already dead.
Is it OK?
Will it burn like in California?
Maybe a fire truck will come.
Did you burn the hostess bar?
Because your dad was there?
Drinking alcohol is bad for your health.
Please, open the door.
Please, open the door.
Did you pee?
Who's the monster?
Why not tell Mr. Hori?
He's kind.
Well, I have a pig's brain.
Your dad is wrong.
There are things I can't say to Mom, either, but...
Your dad died, right?
Actually, he died on a trip with a lady, Noguchi Minako
I see.
Glico.
- Glico. - Big Crunch?
Yeah, the universe keeps expanding.
Right now, it's blowing up like a balloon.
It will split, bam!
Glico.
so clocks, people, trains and cats will all move backwards.
Beef on rice will turn back into cows,
and poop goes back into your butt.
Really?
So, we're going to be reborn.
That's right.
Shall we get ready?
"I'm here."
Maybe here?
- OK? - OK
It's tasty.
You eat concrete.
No, you're not.
You can't look up at the sky.
Am I chubby?
Am I edible?
You're a gourmet food.
I know.
One, two.
Yeah!
You have an amazing talent.
You have an amazing talent.
Do I kick?
You don't kick.
Do I bite and release a poison?
When you're attacked,
That's not a talent.
You stop feeling.
Am I Hoshikawa Yori?
My future.
Bull's eye.
Rugby player.
My future...
My future...
"Mu-Gi-No Mi-Na-To.
"Ho-Shi-Ka-Wa Yo-Ri."
Do you think Mr. Hori will notice?
I don't think he will.
Ouch!
Oh, wait!
So many Over here, too.
There.
Thanks.
Where else?
I found a lot!
- Ouch. - You OK?
It's not your fault.
I was thinking about something.
Where?
Grandma's house.
Your dad's abandoning you.
What a laugh.
Yeah.
I'm not mad.
I'm sorry.
Minato...
Wait, wait, get away.
Get away.
It's OK.
It happens...
To me, sometimes.
Hey, you're supposed to laugh!
Over here!
Pass it, Minato!
Pass it to me! Pass it!
Minato!
Are you friendly with Hoshikawa?
Do you like Hoshikawa?
Gross. You two are lovey dovey.
What?
What are you doing? Stop it!
- No good! - Mugino!
Teacher's here!
You're bandaged.
You're OK!
I'm supposed to report you
but let's keep it a secret.
Time to make up.
Time for you both to change into your gym clothes.
Three, two, one.
Who's the monster?
Who's the monster?
- Who's the... - Minato?
Minato?
Your ear hurt?
I'm sorry.
I...
Can't be like Dad.
I've promised your father.
That I'll hang in there until you're married and have your...
Just an ordinary family you see anywhere is fine.
YORI
Why was I born?
- Say... - Tell him.
Cured of what?
- I'm normal now. - You were always normal.
She's Shindo Ayaka.
Thank you for playing with him.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I lied!
Hoshikawa! Hoshikawa!
- Hurts! - Why can't you do what I tell you!
I'll punish you again.
- Shut up! - Stop! It hurts.
Is that Hori?
It's Hori.
Mugino.
Mugino, Mugino!
We've had enough of his problems.
I'm sorry.
Who are you apologizing to?
Mr. Hori did nothing wrong.
I see.
So did I.
My brass band club used to compete nationally.
Hold it this way.
Your left hand holds this.
And then your mouth here Loosen your lips.
Not bad.
Maybe a lighter instrument is better.
I see,
I, um...
I'm not really sure,
but I like someone.
I see.
I can't tell anyone, so I lie.
In that case,
Blow it away.
But that's nonsense.
If only some people can have it, that's not happiness.
That's just nonsense.
Hoshikawa?
Hoshikawa?
Hoshikawa?
Hoshikawa?
Hoshikawa! The Big Crunch is coming.
It's safe!
You're right.
Sounds like it's taking off.
Were we reborn?
We weren't, we're the same.
OK, great.
[Ronnie] As soon as I come out of rehab,
they told me it's an inside job,
and I was like, "Really?"
I've been searching in the wrong places,
but it was hard.
and go, "Okay."
[Sam] Were you looking away from snooker for peace?
Yeah, listen, if I wanted to quit snooker,
I could've found peace, man.
and gone to Buddhist centres
and sat there on a cushion and ate vegan food
and had a fantastic time,
you know, no stresses, no work, no this.
Ride a bicycle. You know?
But I was never gonna be that person,
So it was kinda like, I'd have that bit,
and then I'd go and play snooker,
and then I'd be like "Oh",
and like the chaos would enter my life again.
be happy and content.
[Commentator] Ronnie breaking off.
it's nice to be able to have a good game to play indoors.
Either.
- [Interviewer] Tea or coffee? - Neither.
- [Interviewer] Cats or dogs? - Neither.
- [Interviewer] Book or film? - Book.
is played on this table.
This is called a billiard table,
on which you play either billiards or snooker.
[Damien] I watched snooker as a kid,
I remember watching when I was younger,
it was brilliant.
The biggest sport on TV,
millions of viewers,
super high glory and drama.
A really great example of art,
because it's full of contradictions.
I love the fact that theoretically
you could make a machine to do it perfectly,
sort of this kind of angular mathematical thing going on,
[Man] The different coloured balls score different points
when they're potted.
[Man] Oh dear.
- [Interviewer] Home or abroad? - Both.
[Interviewer] EastEnders or Coronation Street?
Neither.
[Interviewer] Quality or quantity?
Both.
- [Interviewer] Stick or twist? - Who?
That’s a good description,
just totally instinctive.
he just gets down and like...
What a shot left handed, ladies and gents. Unbelievable.
[Damien] People who don’t know about snooker,
they go "Don’t know snooker, but I know Ronnie."
When you get to that level,
[Interviewer] Savory or sweet?
Neither.
[Interviewer] Family or friends?
Neither.
[Interviewer] Comfort or adventure?
Both.
and it creates, you know, massive highs
That’s a magnificent 147.
No one, especially as you get older,
of fear, of doubt, of surety, of confidence,
sorry, I'm yawning now, I'm absolutely fucked,
be there Tuesday night, play Wednesday.
Everything’s alright, I hope you're well mate.
Paid holiday, mate. Huh?
Well, no, I had twelve days in York, that was nice.
York’s beautiful, so that was nice.
I had a couple days in Liverpool,
so I was with some friends and I was playing in Bolton.
So that was nice. And then here,
so it's different, but it's a bit--
So...
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[Compere] Good afternoon and a very warm welcome
here at Venue Cymru, in Llandudno!
the Rocket, Ronnie O’Sullivan!
but O’Sullivan says he intends to make the most
of the beautiful North Wales scenery
and indulge his passion for running.
for over 12 months,
Ronnie O’Sullivan and Dominic Dale.
But a few errors today from O’Sullivan
[Reporter] Hi Ronnie, great to have a sportsman
Good victory today. Um...
Mm.
Mmm.
Mm!
I love Chinese tea, man. My favourite.
So, hopefully, he's charging up for the new season,
and if he's got a target to concentrate on,
but then that’s not really what Ronnie’s success is about.
You know, he says things like, he'd rather play good and lose,
And that does my head in,
cos I just think it's all about winning.
And you think for someone at Ronnie’s level,
he should think like that,
but he genuinely doesn’t think like that.
[Commentator] ...for this tournament in North Wales,
and Ronnie O’Sullivan through to the last six.
[Ronnie] After three or four tournaments this year,
because I've found a way of enjoying it,
and I've found a way of it not killing me.
I've found a way of going "Oh what?
Got beat, see you tomorrow.
All this and that, you know.
I thought about having a hip replacement,
I said, "Cos I think if I get this hip solid,
I said, "Cos it's just a repetitive sport
and if I could repetitive get in the right line,
I wanted to win titles,
I'm a snooker player, ain't I?
Like, what other option is there?
I used to cry and he used to play all his mates.
Say hello to Father Christmas. Sit there.
Now, hello. Hello, guys.
Yes, yeah, why not?
[Male voice] Ronnie O’Sullivan has already won
[Ronnie] Yeah.
Five ten.
we're gonna try and teach you how to play snooker.
It's a sport that’s getting more and more popular.
This is the event they all most desperately want to win.
have their own snooker table in their garage?
That was a tremendous performance.
Ronnie Junior, first of all, are you really only 14?
- Yeah. Just six weeks ago. - And I'm 14.
and I went, "Look, I'm gonna build a massive big snooker room
I said, "I'm gonna have you
He went "Yeah",
I said, "You come and work with me." [laughs]
I was working up the West End,
and it was exciting times for young men,
working class boys getting good money.
One day, this fella said,
down in Charring Cross Road?"
You know, cos I knew what was good sellers,
[Ronnie] In porn he’s well known as Mr Sullivan.
- People should respect him. - O’Sullivan.
he's just a domesticated husband,
See how the other half live.
Fucking hell.
And wherever we happened to be,
we’re gonna play there today."
know youse was gonna be alright",
come and collect you,
and I thought he's safe."
And I just loved playing snooker.
[Man] When Ronnie joined the club, he was ten,
and he played a member and he knocked in 117 break in the first round.
[Ronnie] I remember the day snooker changed for me.
We was at Barking Snooker Centre,
And I remember, I got to the last 16
and I remember beating this guy,
were like two frames I'd never played before in my life.
I ended up winning the tournament,
Something clicked and made me realise
And then from that moment onwards,
that become the fascination for me.
[Commentator] He has beaten Jimmy White
to become the youngest-ever champion.
[Hendry] I was world champion.
But I remember, there was talk about this kid in Essex,
how talented he was,
and, um, played an exhibition,
Just pure ability.
The natural game for Ronnie, similar to myself,
and win frames in one visit.
That’s when you're in the zone.
He had that ability then.
[Reporter] Attention turns to Llandudno this evening as two of snooker’s all-time greats,
O’Sullivan has struggled to find his rhythm so far,
Ronnie O’Sullivan to get us underway in the 72nd version
of this long-held rivalry.
but that’s not true.
[Commentator] No.
[White] D'you understand? While he's still capable,
he will still keep wanting to win.
But you can't keep switching on and off.
So, John is looking. He could be a long way to winning this match.
but for all-round match play excellence,
O’Sullivan, he'd love to finish in the second century.
Yeah, well played, John.
[Commentator] Quite brilliant from John Higgins,
you'll be lucky to see a more complete display from
just because I played absolutely shit,
Can't wait to get home.
You alright?
I listen to myself now and I just think "Fuck, what's happened to me?"
that I've kind of ripped out any joy that was in me.
Sorry! Nothing to it.
But, I lacked a lot of confidence.
but I needed that guidance.
I'm like, I'm nine or ten.
[Ronnie Sr.] Alright.
[Ronnie] I needed it, I think.
Because, you know, I...
as a player, as a person.
[Maria] I remember when it first happened, Sam.
and I just knew something wasn't right.
His manager, Barry Hearn, phoned me up, he said,
"Maria, you’ve gotta tell him."
I said, "Barry, I can't."
"Because he I'm trying to protect him, Sam."
I thought if he goes there three days early,
And I heard him screaming, screaming down the phone, Sam,
Cos I knew how close they were.
My regret now is, Sam,
But I thought I'd protect him, and it was wrong.
And I don’t think he ever forgave me for that, Ronnie.
"You should’ve told me", but I couldn’t.
And that’s one regret I've got.
It broke in half,
he tried to shove the other half in my face,
I blocked it with my fingers, he severed my fingers.
Right? I backed off.
And I don’t remember nothing after that.
But I know I took that man’s life,
and I know I hurt the other one.
And I don’t wanna talk aboutn this
because it's not fair on the people that have lost their son.
I'm still alive, thank God,
Not cried for meself.
I cried for me family losing everything.
I left 'em, didn’t I?
Know what I mean?
I didn’t think he was gonna play anymore.
Everything was over.
[Ronnie] Nothing can prepare you for that.
I just couldn’t believe it.
We got the verdict through,
He...
You get a bit emotional sometimes, don’t you?
Really, you get emotional, and you
And, uh...
Typical.
"Just tell my boy to win."
That’s it.
Ronnie O’Sullivan!
[Announcer] Ronnie O’Sullivan.
[Commentator] He's not 18 yet.
You know, "Just fuck everybody."
The healthiest thing for me to do would probably be just stop playing snooker.
Now I'm a man
and I've gotta go out and do what I do best,
and that’s play snooker.
that’ll be definitely for me dad.
[Commentator] Snooker history here.
and he's done it...
Ronnie O’Sullivan,
arrived at Gartree Prison
just a normal... whatever normal life is.
but looking back at that, it was a nightmare.
People could see that I was imploding.
gone on in the last few months
A mixture of, I think, depression and rage.
[Commentator] Greater players, deservedly.
[White] But he can go and play near-perfect snooker
[White] But, as a perfectionist,
he could get down on himself.
[Commentator] Perfect, yes, absolutely perfect.
has made the fastest ever maximum break in history of the game,
he cleared the table in just five minutes 20 seconds,
"I just wanna be happy."
[Hendry] A lot of people talk about genius in sport,
but, that is genius in sport.
it is so difficult.
I think it's the greatest thing that’s happened in any sport, ever.
He played a match against me
He beat me.
[Referee] Seven.
[Hendry] But certainly in the 90s,
I always felt I was mentally stronger
Because you can't imagine any sport being psychologically intense as snooker.
[Referee] Thirty.
And it’ll devastate you.
[Referee] Ronnie O’Sullivan, 30.
[Wood] He drowned his sorrows
and escaped it.
He’d have an ounce,
and that was the indulgence of addiction.
He'd have highs and lows and he'd be right up on a buzz
and then he’d go flat as a pancake.
And I thought, "What's wrong with him?"
"I'm gonna... I'm gonna do this."
Yeah.
[Ronnie] At this moment, I look back and I think, "Wow, how have I got through that?"
Cos it was that bad.
The darkness and stress and addiction,
I didn’t know how to live sober.
and they tried to teach me that in the Priory.
cos it drives me on, but just needs to be managed.
we done like five, six miles round here.
And that’s when I got in to the running.
[chuckling] Hashtag. Mental health.
Been saying that for 20 odd years, mate.
That’s the funny thing, people will be like,
I was 20 years ahead of the game, mate.
They all jumped on the bandwagon,
that’s what I love, you got all the bandwagoners.
"Oh, mental health!"
It's cool to be mental health now.
Jesus Christ!
[chuckling] Oh.
and we’ll just play it by ear and do what we gotta do.
cos it's 2,000 people, whatever it is, it's in London,
Alright, mate. Bye bye. Bye.
[Damien] I once had a time with Ronnie
"Look, I'm in the Masters,
He goes, "Do you think I'm bad pulling out?"
and I just said, "Look, I've got the car, I've called the Priory,
don’t worry about Barry Hearn,
And he went, "Okay",
and he calmed down a bit and said,
"D'you wanna have a little knock-about
and then he went, "I think I might play this afternoon."
I went, "Okay, I'll stay with you."
And I stayed and he won the fucking tournament.
Now I tell that story, it's ridiculous, but it's all real,
it's like, "No glory’s worth it if you're not alright."
as the world’s top 16 players battle it out
for the Masters title at Alexandra Palace.
[Hendry] The two tournaments that I wanted to win
and the Masters.
Cos the Masters is the top 16 players in the world,
The Masters is intense,
[Commentator] Hello, good afternoon, and welcome to Alexandra Palace,
always an electric atmosphere when Ronnie O’Sullivan is in town.
all night, all this morning, I was like making myself ill,
went to the gym, didn’t overdo it.
You know, obviously it's like...
[Commentator] Ronnie O’Sullivan's own Masters' records,
[Announcer] Ronnie O’Sullivan!
not knowing from one day to the next,
"Is my game gonna be good?
And I'll do that every day.
I've had six days where it's been great,
but you're just hanging on.
And then the seventh day, it's gone,
and you're like, "Oh, I knew it’d happen."
[Commentator] He’ll be pretty annoyed with himself.
What? He's shaking hands, this is quite incredible.
Don’t know what's going on.
I've never seen anything like this.
you just don’t do that.
He just said he's had enough.
It's bizarre.
[Man] We all want to see Ronnie playing at his best,
It's what people come to see.
But, sadly, there is a flaw there.
"If you want to get a large audience anywhere,
They're gonna do something where they may die,
that there's like death involved,
I shared all his snooker tournaments,
and I've heard the anxiety in him.
Just totally like collapsing on the phone.
and I haven’t been really well.
I blame myself for that, you know, going to prison,
And he's saying, "I've had enough.
Yeah, he wanted to put his cue down, done.
and just make a decision and do it.
this my last season as a player, to be honest with you.
Thought about it, yeah. Heavily.
[inaudible] sometimes, you know.
and if you win it's even better."
[Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, here comes the Rocket,
Ronnie O'Sullivan!
People listen to the chaos in my life,
And I go, "Yeah, but that’s the only time that
and I just think, "You know what, I'm safe here."
Ah!
You fall in love and out of love with snooker. Well, I do.
And for me, snooker’s fantastic when you're in that space.
and you're able to do it.
Because obviously the pressure there
the more you can deliver under pressure.
you don’t think.
Your mind feels clear,
And quiet.
It's like you're razor sharp.
And it's just... Yeah, yeah, it's just good.
Huh.
It feels good. It feels powerful.
[Ronnie] I had moments when I was young where I'd feel invincible.
And you’ll be enjoying every bit of this, Ronnie.
playing as well as he can.
- Ronnie. - [Ronnie] Thanks, guys.
That reception tells you everything.
Yeah, I struggled early on, you know,
Such a big crowd, been playing behind closed doors for so long,
let alone a crowd like this, full of mad Londoners.
[Announcer] And from one big match to another great afternoon,
Well, I just savour every match I play, uh...
I've just gotta keep thinking of that,
[Announcer] Well done this afternoon, Ronnie,
they absolutely loved it.
Ronnie O’Sullivan, ladies and gents.
but, he fucking bought the scones
It's my favourite, from Marks and Spencer’s,
it has to be from M&S cos they just do it right.
[Wood] Ronnie deserves to have more of that feeling all the time.
And the flow...
But Robertson’s in excellent form this season,
[Referee] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
[Commentator] ...gets this match underway.
Yes, and I don’t think it needs any explaining, no matter how good you are.
There's gonna be that little bit of tension in the arm, Ronnie just over-hit that.
Whenever you play Ronnie O’Sullivan,
particularly in the Masters,
and it looks that way now for Neil Robertson.
and he thinks Ronnie will serve him
in his backyard by six frames to four.
[Ronnie] First time in a long time,
probably five, six years,
So, like, in that environment, that venue, with that crowd,
You're okay with it though, aren't you?
I just think it's about management.
There's just so much self-criticism involved, I think.
- than I ever have been. - No, I think you are.
But I think that’s your mood today.
When you see it in a romantic way,
but the reality is,
and that’s when the kinda questions come in.
So, you notice it?
"Jesus, why is he doing this?
Why does he put himself through it?"
It's like so, like, soul destroying.
D'you know what I mean? But that’s because I think cos you do love it,
I think it did help, yeah.
going "Alright, listen", you know?
- Yeah. - You know
Because I wanna play, you know.
and going, "This is actually good for me."
Yeah.
Otherwise, it's like self-sabotage, isn't it?
It's like self-harm.
Yeah. No, no, yeah, no
- Which you’ve gone in to. - Absolutely.
I won't ever go there again.
- No. - No.
I think I got so good at being hard on myself,
work this brain.
That if I do X, Y and Z,
I'm gonna be alright.
[Ronnie] I think a big thing for me is I have this fear that I'm gonna fall apart,
[Peters] What's gonna make you win?
It's gotta be all about what you do on the table.
Anything else is, even including your own thoughts,
feel a few butterflies out there, boom, boom, boom,
And that’s why you were getting really in a distressed state.
Eighteen years.
I tell you what the biggest thing I felt though, when we first met,
and I was expecting that, and you didn’t.
Because it's common sense, it's self-evident that happy people win in life.
and then we’ll work on the rest."
[Ronnie] Yeah.
You’ve got there.
Well, if you I mean, snooker, obviously,
it's a sport that’s not as physical as some,
and clearly, you will lose it as you get older,
cos you're not gonna be doing this when you're 80 at this standard, I assume.
Why ask the question? Why not see what you do?
I'd like to go, "You know what, I've got ten years,
I don’t have an answer. What I can say is that if you keep looking at your age,
you're gonna start saying, "Oh I'm 46, I won't do as well",
and I don’t want that, I think if you wanna win,
the next 17 days at the Crucible Theatre
and a chance for one of the 32 players
[Hendry] When you used to drive down,
You know, I wanted to beat Steve Davis’s six,
Ronnie wants to beat my seven, you know,
although he never admits it, but he does.
Your game, your skill, your stamina, your temperament, your compo everything.
And even when I go back there now, I get goose bumps.
Cos it's just the greatest place to play snooker.
[Radio presenter] Big 17 days of snooker as the world snooker championship
[Commentator] Yeah, I think that this particular stat,
of seven world championship wins,
I watched him in the last tournament, I thought he played outstandingly well.
You know, on his first world ranking title at 17, that was in UK,
and his most recent
It's not suited for me.
But, it's a choice, you know, I've got a choice.
You know, it's like I always said, you have two systems,
Hurt, you know, and suffer.
but, that’s not gonna win me the world championships, you know.
Sometimes you have to choose which one you're...
Yeah. Okay.
Why don’t you have this breakfast?
No, no, I'll wait, I'll wait.
give me them them eggs then, that’ll do.
Wicked.
Yeah.
- It's all very civilised, Jim, isn't it? - Yeah.
Yeah, how things have changed.
How d'you feel you played yesterday?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
When you was three nil down, right,
What d'you think happened there then?
But I wasn't just flowing, it weren't like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
There was a point where I was sitting there going
and that’s what you do at Sheffield.
[Jimmy] Yeah, but you don’t show you're nervous.
No, I know, cos you kinda like
Cos, you know, it's hard, he's playing you, right?
[Jimmy] Normal circumstances, from six three, got control of the game.
[Ronnie] Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
he's got that pressure ball red in the middle and he's sort of thought
[Ronnie] Yeah, "I'm in."
and he missed the red and that’s all over.
but that still weren't enough.
That’s what I'm saying, snooker’s a craz
Of course, it is.
[Jimmy] I just feel, for me, I just feel you're sharp,
- Are you? - Yeah. Because it's great
[Ronnie] I hate I cos that means
it's all snooker and you're buzzing cos of snooker.
- Oh, don’t say that. - Shut up.
- Oh mate. - Listen
I wanna yeah, I wanna I'm enjoying playing,
It's mustard, innit?
[Hendry] When you're playing against Ronnie,
That’s the worst thing you can do, I've seen players do it,
Cos he never has to think.
It's what, even now, stands him apart from the rest.
But you come to the Crucible and you think
"God, I've gotta play well for 17 days, gotta be concentrating,
I've gotta play my best, I've gotta have the courage
to overcome players in that arena day after day after day",
and negative thoughts can creep in.
Think he needs to try and forget about that tip
I'd say probably six, seven times in the last six,
[Referee] 26. Ronnie O’Sullivan.
Breaks of 87, 131 and 96 were the highlight from the six times champion.
mate, stays out there.
- [Interviewer] Thank you. - What you done? It's your hair.
Your hair looks good like that. -Thank you.
[Male voice] You gonna do then? -Not enough press.
Not enough tournaments, not enough press, these fuckers are doing my head in.
[Referee] 30.
[Man] Well
[Ronnie] There's enough meat on it?
[Damien] But I think one thing that Ronnie maybe doesn’t realise,
is that people like the hope and the fears,
they like him fucked and pulling off a good shot,
rather than just doing amazing shots and playing perfect snooker.
Perfect snooker’s kinda boring.
He's always looking for perfection, I don’t think it's about perfection.
It's about drama.
Fucking hell mate. Oh, god.
Yeah, yeah.
Bit like Serena Williams, a bit like Tiger Woods, maybe.
I had that type of father-figure, where he was just like
I weren't bothered, I was happy-go-lucky.
So, like I say, it doesn’t come natural to me,
it's hard to sort of settle for anything less.
"Right, running, you run, you play better."
I was like "Okay."
With his mate in the car. I know, fuck. Humiliating.
[Ronnie Sr.] Ron, there’s no way you'll beat me.
- No way. - Nah.
[Ronnie] I thought, yeah, alright, been right on pretty much everything else,
made me realise that he was right, I was just a lazy bastard.
I still don’t wanna do the hard work.
And he weren't having it.
I'm telling you mate, he's got like this fucking thing
where he just makes you believe you can do anything.
Honestly, it's fucking scary.
and now I just take certain bits, cos I think if I was to listen to him,
I'd probably run off the fucking cliff and go "I can fly",
and obviously Ronnie used to look up
and think that’s how he thought he should be.
[Ronnie Sr.] Well played, Ronnie.
Two players, you've done 'em, son.
Get down that line, boy. Come on, son. Let’s work.
[Interviewer] No nerves about being on television? -No.
[Interviewer] So, dad knows his place
and you certainly seem to know yours Ronnie, well done.
Thanks.
cos I was watching him play and I thought "He hits the ball different."
But he was so vulnerable,
you know, he hits the ball better than me, everyone’s hitting the ball ",
everyone’s better than him.
And then he’d win the tournament, and I go, "You’ve just won the bloody tou
what's going on? How comes we win the tournament with you,
but you know, still not happy,
So much style and finesse.
Perfection.
That’s what he he was looking for.
He's still trying to master it.
the six times champion, Ronnie O’Sullivan,
and the four times winner John Higgins.
It's Ronnie O’Sullivan who gets this match underway.
[Referee] Ronnie O’Sullivan to break.
[Ronnie] Some players can grind it out.
Got a good temperament, they're very methodical, very robotic.
And you just think, "He ain't breaking down."
I remember John Higgins give me a complete smashing in one semi-final.
That hurt me. You know, I felt humiliated.
I'm an instinctive player, I play better when I'm instinctive,
I play better when I don’t have to engage my brain.
[Referee] Thirty eight.
God, Jesus, that's
It's
[Referee] Ronnie O’Sullivan, 30.
For fuck’s sake, man. Unbelievable.
I think that getting sucked in to playing at that pace, then I'm fucked.
Know what I mean? Two hours.
Yeah but I'm just saying like, but I
it's like Selby-like snooker.
- Worse. - Know what I mean?
I wanna keep you out there as long as I can, until fucking you crack.
And get bored. Know what I mean? But I ain't.
Yeah.
set my shot up, I ain't you know what I mean?
they can do that for as much as they like, I don’t fucking care.
Cos I ain't got nowhere to go anyway.
- Yeah. - Know what I'm saying?
Can't beat a salmon and cream cheese, mate.
- No. - No.
between these two legends of the game, Steve,
neither player has been able to dominate so far,
John Higgins then built a six five lead,
to level proceedings at six all at the mid-section interval.
[Ronnie] Gotta play the right shot, play it positive.
[Man] He's blinking cycling himself out of it.
Well, he might win this match, he might win a few matches,
but at some point, someone’s gonna come out
I wanna be that person that plays the game, a winning game. At all times.
If my game’s on and I'm playing, I'll win, if I ain't, fuck it, you know.
One of them things. But I'm not going negative.
[Man] No.
[Commentator] Starting to impose himself
Come on.
cos I know that if you win playing a losing game, eventually you get fucked.
D'you know what I'm saying? -[Man] Yeah.
[Commentator] John Higgins led three nil,
It's very absorbing, the session of snooker, goodness me, the intensity in it.
What is at stake? Incredible semi-final.
[Ronnie] Agh! Balls snap.
Whipping it.
[Commentator] All eyes at where the black goes.
And in a poor place for O’Sullivan.
Look where the black’s gone.
No way of getting on the black from this, it seems.
Jesus, state of this table.
[Commentator] I tell you what, he's looking at taking the red on.
top cushion and back in round behi
this’ll be the shot of the championship if he pulls this off.
It goes.
Brilliant shot then, wasn't it? Really was.
Quite simply a must-pot. On the black now.
It looks good, if it misses the blue.
The slightest of angles, try and get, somehow, on to the yellow.
This is tough.
It's there. Ronnie O’Sullivan has done almost the impossible in this round.
Even a little reaction from Ronnie there.
[Robbie Huxley] Absolutely -Deserved some bit of luck.
- That final frame - I had fuck-all luck
Yeah, that final frame was stupendous.
Unbelievable. Jesus.
I played the canon on the red to get the red out there.
Yeah, that was amazing black.
and then I pinged the yellow in, I've zipped it in,
I played a good brown, I flicked it in
and I thought, "Oh whoa."
- Know what I mean? - John Wayne stuff.
Oh, John Wayne.
It was blinking True Grit.
Anyway, well done.
Only halfway through mate.
Oh!
I know, yeah I know you struggled in that half.
I know you struggled.
around the world as well, it's just incredible what he's trying to achieve here.
Cos I might not ever make another final.
Truth is, I might not ever make another final, d'you know what I mean, Crucible final.
I want you to experience being here with people",
like "You sure? You know", I went, "No, come... let 'em come down",
So today I just kinda need that quiet,
other than just a knock on the door, five minutes, boom, go out there, play.
around the world snooker championship,
the final between Ronnie O’Sullivan
This final doesn’t need any hype as it should be a bank holiday blockbuster.
Judd Trump is also a fast-attacking player,
he's trying to be crowned Crucible king for a second time,
he says playing the sport’s biggest star in the final
is a career highlight for him.
Sometimes when I look out this window,
You look out and you think,
"God, all them people enjoying themselves, and I'm in here."
he was playing in the world finals with Graeme Dott,
if he's not in the balls tap once and then I'll know what's happening."
And then I had to go Radio Five Live.
[Radio presenter] They're opening five frames,
and I'm pacing about the wing and I'm thinking, "Fucking hell",
cos the Rocket’s just finishing off at the Crucible, Phillips done.
At night, where it's all quiet, everyone’s got their nut down,
you know, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Six hundred cons smashing the doors, for my son,
it just blew me away, you know.
You couldn’t give me a billion pound for that experience.
As he's getting older, I think he's managed to cope with the anxiety, the pressure,
and I think he's learnt to push it down a little bit,
but Ronnie likes living on the edge.
About 20 years ago I realised
to find happiness within snooker was a dangerous thing.
but sometimes you have to.
[Ronnie] The world championships, when that door opens,
And I'm saying "No, I wanna win this tournament", and then you're off and running.
This is the one that matters. -The first frame...
The first mistake could be costly.
and the little shifts in momentum, you know,
where the other guy’s on me, but you kind of have to respond,
[Referee] Six.
It's just little shots like that,
the difference between winning and losing the game.
[Ronnie] And that momentum and that speed
and that energy is sort of...
it's getting stronger and stronger
to the point where you're all over your opponent.
[Commentator] Well, that’s... -[Referee] Twenty six.
[Commentator] That little shot.
[Ronnie] You're strangling him, it's just that... that power.
[Referee] Eight.
[Referee] Ronnie O’Sullivan, eight.
- Fucking... - The first seven.
Nightmare.
[Commentator] So unlucky to snooker himself.
- Yeah? - I've seen a gesture...
- Sorry? A gesture? - Yeah.
cos you saw nothing. You saw nothing.
Go and look at your camera. You saw nothing. Don’t start.
Don’t start. Go and check your camera.
there is no in-between.
Yeah, there's no stopping it basically.
[Commentator] And a chance if Ronnie can get this black
How did he play...
Ronnie O’Sullivan placed his lead, twelve frames...
Barring one of the great Crucible comebacks,
Ronnie O’Sullivan is on course to even Stephen Hendry’s record of seven...
It's very hard to see a way back for Trump.
I mean he's in real trouble.
[Ronnie] Hi mate. Yeah, I'm just...
don’t know what to think really, to be honest with you.
and I'm not sure if I played good, bad.
Everyone seems to think it was really great and this and that,
I don’t know if he was just bad and it made me look good.
Gotta go again tomorrow. Take it easy, bye.
the pressure that Ronnie’s under is like some sort of horrific torture.
And loads of it's imagined and loads of it's real.
Still the same stuff.
As I'm talking to you now, I'm sort of shaking a bit.
You know?
[Man] Because you're talking or just because...
It's the build-up.
[Commentator] This afternoon, the situation is very simple for Judd Trump,
there’ve been early chances for both players,
but it looks like Trump is the favourite to claim this frame,
[Commentator] Can Ronnie find something here?
Been playing second fiddle most of this session.
[Crowd] Oh!
[Ronnie] Nervy, nervy. Nervy. Nervy, nervy, nervy.
- Nervy, mate. - ...and he's won all three.
Hate this bit, I hate this bit.
Part of the job, isn't it?
Stick with it.
[Commentator] He's needed two opportunities to claim this frame,
I'm questioning my technique, I'm out there and thinking
"Oh, I don’t wanna stand here, stand there,
get on that line, get on this line, get there."
But I then think "How am I gonna go and play?"
[Referee] Thirty three.
[Man] Great shot.
[Ronnie] Fuck that. I feel ill.
- Are you alright? - Feel ill with pressure.
Judd Trump has just won the last two frames, which were close,
he now trails 13 ten so it's game on,
especially if Trump can win the final two frames of this session.
[Ronnie] I feel fucked, energy’s drained.
- You're fine. - No, I can't,
Yeah, we've got a break now, we're gonna regroup.
It's like I can't even put the cue through.
No but even on every shot, I think I'm gonna miss this, like fuck!
I'm looking, I think I'm blurry eyes, honestly Steve,
like honestly, fucking horrendous.
You’ve gotta go out there with attitude now.
[Ronnie] Hi, mate, I just thought I'd send you this voice note,
I froze today, mate,
and I fucking hate this shit, mate.
but I'm just sharing it with you, mate,
I just wanna get this over and fucking done with,
I feel fucking battered. Alright, I'll speak to you later, bye.
not just a snooker robot.
I think Ronnie did an amazing job,
a very noble job
of saying
how fucked up he is inside,
and how he's fucking thinking, you know.
so much out of his system with the game.
but what about Ronnie now?
a real match, and Judd Trump has all the momentum...
[Sports reporter] It's worth mentioning that it's Judd who’s won
the last four finals between these guys
over the last, what, three, four years.
[Sports reporter] Yeah, and I think if you offered Ronnie
Shaking.
[Commentator] Everybody asking the same question, "What happens now?"
Now, first half opportunity for Ronnie O’Sullivan,
this lone red in to the bottom right corner pocket.
Got a bit to do with the cue ball here.
It looked easy. Some shot he's played there.
Fuck me, I feel absolutely bashed up.
I feel bashed up, Steve.
I don’t feel I can make 20 when I get the balls. I don’t.
I feel better than I did, I feel a bit calmer.
[Commentator] Yeah, just looks so relaxed, so cool.
[Referee] Thirty four.
[Commentator] Would've said, at times in this afternoon’s session...
It's understandable, of course, on a precipice of history, glory,
out in to play, a little cannon.
O’Sullivan wins three of the first four,
and one away from winning his seventh world championship title.
So, he's gotta win seven on the bounce.
[Commentator] Well, this red is potable, but,
He's played the cannon.
Fabulous pot.
But when I was watching him,
He’ll get that mantle.
And just this black.
And he's gonna join you now, Stephen.
[Referee] Sixty eight.
Because he plays the game
to submerge it so that... just didn’t perform on day one left to play.
Ronnie O’Sullivan is in seventh heaven.
[inaudible] against Judd Trump.
Eighteen frames to thirteen.
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, don’t let 'em burn you out.
you're too good to let them fucking burn you, alright.
No, listen. You're a good boy.
I'll always take my time for you, I respect you, you're a good man.
- Thank you so much. - And your family’s good, yeah?
- Thank you. - Alright? Love you man.
- Well done man. - Go and enjoy it.
You're my best player of all-time.
- Cheers, mate. - Fucking love you, man.
- I won! - Incredible.
So much hard work as well.
- It fucking kills me. - You fucking deserve everything,
- Mate... mate... - Thank you.
Mate, you're amazing, like the dedication, everything that you’ve put in,
You fucking helped everyone, mate. Mate, mate, everyone is so proud of you.
- Thank you. - Go celebrate with your family,
- man, enjoy yourself. - Love you.
Okay, well done, mate.
- [Man] No matter what. - [Woman] We love you.
Dad, that’s Fred. Fred’s a top man.
- Hello, Fred. - That’s me dad.
- Hello, mate. - Yeah.
No, fuck that.
That’s it, innit? Oi.
Fucking hell. I dunno, mate.
- Done now, ain't ya? - Dunno.
Yeah, yeah, course, yeah. Lovely, cool. Thank you, cheers.
That was me in my peak state.
That was me kinda going in the trenches
and kind of having to go "No, I wanna win this tournament."
But with snooker, you’ve gotta put up
with all that toxic sort of competitiveness that...
That’s why I have to just play...
Cos it's like, you can't win.
There’s no end to like, "He's falling, he's slipping.
Oh, now he's winning, he's great.
And then he's losing, "Oh, he's slipping, oh, is his days numbered?"
I'm like "Oh God, I've heard that for 30 years."
30 years!
They're always gonna find a problem.
That’s how I've got with it.
You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don’t,
And I play snooker
and I win enough to go "You know what?"
That’s what I think.
That’s what I think of them.
It's fucking...
Fuck, that’s what I really feel.
<i>From that day on, Mom became a different person.</i>
<i>Besides looking after me,</i>
<i>she only cared about fighting to get the survivor benefit.</i>
Why don't you play with us?
What's your name?
I'm Sheng Huainan.
Huainan,
be a good boy and come here.
Wait here.
Take your medicine.
Come!
Slow down!
Ma'am.
What a marvelous wedding!
Mr. Sheng couldn't attend?
he wouldn't have time to work.
Right.
He's a busy man.
About the survivor benefit…
Please ask him to do us this favor.
How can you say that?
My daughter lost her father at a very young age.
Don't make a scene!
And don't be ridiculous!
Come on!
Faster!
Hit her!
Give me the car!
Push him down!
Push him down!
Push him down!
Luo Zhi!
What are you doing?
Let's go home!
What happened?
It was that girl!
ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL 2008
Hurry up!
What's your rank?
Luo Zhi!
Hi.
Make way.
Make way, please.
Sheng Huainan.
Sheng Huainan. Who is it?
I heard he just transferred here and he's super handsome!
Cut the crap!
Isn't it obvious?
You call that insufficient evidence?
We can definitely sue them!
Stop talking nonsense!
Give it back!
Do you think I'm blind?
Who erased it?
I pay your tuition.
And you just lie to me like this?
It's reserved for me.
<i>To our wonder,</i>
<i>a transfer student has gotten the first place,</i>
<i>which has invigorated Zhenhua High School</i>
<i>and served as a wake-up call for some students.</i>
<i>Please welcome to the stage,</i>
<i>Sheng Huainan!</i>
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>
<i>As a high school student,</i>
<i>and our mission is to climb over it.</i>
<i>Having said that,</i>
<i>on the other side?</i>
<i>Sheng Huainan.</i>
<i>would walk into my life again one day.</i>
SHENG HUAINAN
<i>But for me,</i>
<i>it's the opening of a ceremony.</i>
<i>He became my first opponent in my youth.</i>
<i>My only opponent.</i>
Next group!
Boys' first group.
Get ready for the test!
Hurry up!
Ready, set…
Come on, Sheng Huainan!
She has the same shoes as Huainan.
Really?
Ready, set…
Sheng Huainan doesn't like girls like that.
Zhanyan runs really fast.
Set…
Come on!
Wenrui!
Wenrui!
Hey, fatty! How do you fall over while running?
Simple! She's too heavy to keep her balance!
My lucky charm is missing.
It's gone?
My lucky charm is missing.
Come on, everyone! Back off!
What are you doing?
Cut it out!
Luo Zhi!
Forget it! Let's go!
Wait up!
Is this yours?
Thanks.
Found it.
ME TOO.
I DID IT ON PURPOSE.
YOU SAW ME?
ONLY FROM THE BACK.
What are you babbling about?
Stand up! Up!
Don't lie down!
Get ready! It's show time!
Settle down!
Hi, Zhanyan, over here!
You stand up front.
Let's listen to Zhanyan's a cappella version first.
Ma'am,
I think it'll sound better with a piano accompaniment.
She's so finicky!
Hey, be nice!
Zhanyan's got a point.
But it's too late to find a suitable player.
I know someone who's good enough.
Sheng Huainan.
Sheng Huainan?
Sheng Huainan, please help us out.
The school hunk?
Wow!
Stop it!
Did you practice that move?
"Outside the long corridor,
along the ancient road." To your right!
"The green grass seemed to connect with the sky." Go over it!
<i>Outside the long corridor along the ancient road</i>
<i>The green grass seemed to connect with the sky</i>
Trees, move!
Trees! It's your cue!
<i>The night breeze caressed the willows and the flute resonated</i>
Ma'am, I want to quit.
Right!
It's unfair!
Okay.
Go ahead!
Come on!
Go, Luo Zhi!
<i>Outside the long corridor along the ancient road</i>
<i>The green grass seemed to connect with the sky</i>
Very good.
Come here, Zhanyan.
Stay focused! To your places!
<i>It wouldn't be so cold tonight</i>
Sheng Huainan!
I like you.
Wow!
What happened?
Somebody just confessed!
Who's that?
This time next year,
we'll have graduated.
And I don't want to have any regrets.
Say yes! Say yes!
Say yes! Say yes!
Say yes!
- Disappointing. - It's not funny.
What a bummer.
Hey!
Zheng Wenrui!
Zheng Wenrui, are you okay?
Are you okay?
Thanks, Luo Zhi.
I don't regret it.
Don't you like Sheng Huainan too?
Luo Zhi,
you're better than me in every way.
I really don't understand what's holding you back.
<i>Will we ever</i>
<i>end up in the same world?</i>
Where's my diary?
It was right here.
They're made for each other.

Got the shot?
Of course!
Great!
Your reaction was so spontaneous!
What department are you in?
You're a natural.
Are you interested in joining our film club?
I'm serious.
Don't go!
Hey!
<i>I just wanted to thank her</i>
<i>and make friends.</i>
And what am I, chopped liver?
I have every reason to be mad!
<i>or we break up.</i>
Sweetie,
Then time me.
Sure.
Here we go.
<i>will always be given back to you unexpectedly.</i>
<i>Sheng Huainan,</i>
<i>we meet again after all this time.</i>
Time's up!
You shouldn't cry over a man for more than 10 minutes!
you should never let a man know how much you care about him,
I want to cry again.
Jiang Baili!
Stop crying!
I won't allow it.
Luoluo,
you'd understand why I'm crying.
Any bread cakes left?
No. A dark-skinned guy took them all.
Hi!
Here!
I can't eat them all anyway.
I'm Zhang Mingrui.
I study Economics and Management.
I mainly run a film club though.
So you're the Luo Zhi
from Zhenhua High School.
The teacher would take your essays as examples.
Sorry.
We broke up.
You know what?
They were planning to go abroad together,
but he stayed here
to be my friend instead.
Take me as an example.
I'm striving to introduce Chinese cinema to the world.
And how can I make that happen?
Under my leadership,
the film club will produce a historical sci-fi movie
to show China's progress in science and technology,
its powerful industry,
and concern for humanity.
I've already thought of the title.
<i>Endless Love.</i>
You're made for that role.
The production will start this weekend.
And the lead actress is Luo Zhi.
You're the lead actor. Say something!
Come and join us when you're free.
Please.
Great!
Why?
Cut!
You saw Leonids before.
Coming, director.
We need more blood!
Professionalism is key.
Get our stuff!
The UFO!
Leave it! Run!
I'll sit there.
Today we're gonna analyze a case.
Company A contracted Company B to carry out a project.
To get overtime pay for the Spring Festival,
Mr. Zhang, from Company B, worked for 52 hours nonstop,
which resulted in his sudden death.
The plaintiffs are Zhang's family.
Apart from Company B,
can Company A also be considered a defendant,
I think Company A
should take some responsibility. What do you think?
Go tell the professor.
These two names are interesting.
Because they are both from one Chinese poem.
Sheng Huainan.
Here.
Luo Zhi.
Here.
Luo Zhi will be the prosecution lawyer.
When the accident happened,
The accident happened on a dispatch mission from the defendant.
Therefore, apart from Company B,
Your Honor.
Yes.
The plaintiff's family member was indeed the defendant's employee,
but since the moment
Company A contracted with Company B for the project,
all obligations and responsibilities
were also assigned to Company B.
Although Company B was contracted,
Company A's responsibility to the deceased can be assigned.
So such joint responsibility is invalid.
May I remind you
that, in this case,
he's not just a plaintiff's family member or just another Zhang.
He's flesh and blood.
<i>He chose to trust you.</i>
<i>He devoted his energy and time to you.</i>
did you review their health protection system for workers?
He was willing to do extra work for you,
But you don't feel gratitude.
Don't you feel guilty?
I agree with the prosecution lawyer's argument.
Sorry for the wait.
Thanks.
- I'm leaving. - Okay.
Hey.
Why do you think?
I'm hungry. So I came to grab a bite.
Be careful.
Thanks.
I suppose you know that eating like this
won't get me any commission whatsoever.
Huh?
Luo Zhi,
Why not?
So?
That's the norm for most people.
Hello?
Baili!
What about my girlfriend's dress?
You think you can bully us just because we're working students?
Pay for it!
Can you?
Sorry.
Sorry.
An extra N.
I'll give you 300. I'm so sorry.
Go away!
Stop fighting!
Stop!
Stop!
- Mingrui, let's split! - Okay!
Run!
Stop!
What's your problem?
Over there!
You were right.
I always judge others through my own lenses,
I didn't even know I was hurting others.
to make a living.
It's good.
I feel ashamed.
That's okay.
Your sense of superiority just saved us.
Have you watched <i>Only Yesterday?</i>
Back in high school,
One day, I saw a line from that movie
written on the wall by someone else.
I really like that movie.
So I wrote back to her.
I used to think
it was Ye Zhanyan.
FROM SHENG HUAINAN: YOU'RE NOT OUT, RIGHT?
TO SHENG HUAINAN: IN THE DORM.
SHENG HUAINAN: WAIT FOR ME.
Be careful.
Okay.
May I take it?
Sorry I'm late.
As usual!
What is it?
Let's go.
How much further?
Not so much.
Almost there.
Look!
That island
is where we're gonna shoot!
Let's go!
It's a scenic place!
It's so far!
Be careful, everyone.
Director,
if the world were about to end,
what would be your last wish?
What a silly question!
Just tell me.
Give me the camera.
Don't film me!
I'd like to get on the Forbes list.
I'd like to meet someone who loves me…
I'd like to be skinny.
…more than I love him.
I'm not brave.
So I'd like to…
do all the things I dare not do.
Come over here!
I'd just
and watch her quietly.
I'm joking.
Young forever!
Sunny days,
cloudy days
Rainy days.
Me too.
Don't run!
You can't catch me!
<i>We've been together for a month,</i>
<i>our chemistry and our encounter</i>
<i>are no accident.</i>
<i>It's more of a confession</i>
<i>than a profession of love.</i>
What are you writing?
<i>Two people fall in love.</i>
<i>Only one of them knows</i>
Right?
Yes.
NOODLES FOR SHENG HUAINAN
Here come your noodles.
Let's go.
You followed me?
I'm afraid to lose you.
Sheng Huainan,
Right.
- You're home! - Yeah.
I'll take that.
Go light some incense for your dad.
Sister, come on in!
Wenjing, I wanna tell you…
Aunt Fu.
Luoluo's back!
She just arrived. Here's her luggage.
Don't mind me.
Look!
We've all signed as witnesses.
How can I thank you?
The trial starts the day after tomorrow.
We finally see some hope.
FROM SHENG HUAINAN: LET'S GO TO ZHENHUA TOMORROW.
Hey!
A junior lent it to me.
Where's yours?
You can't get in without it.
Go in by yourself then.
Okay.
Bye.
ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL
Luo Zhi,
why do you always walk behind me?
From today on, I'll walk behind you.
Sure.
Hand out the exam papers.
Some even failed the poem cloze tests
in this practice exam.
These poem cloze tests
yet some of you didn't get them right.
"Myriads of flowers slowly enchant the eye."
What's the next verse?
You answer. Stand up!
Sheng Huainan,
you're now enchanted and perplexed, indeed.
Don't you have better things to do at university?
Relax your fingers.
LUO ZHI LOVES SHENG HUAINAN AND NOBODY KNOWS IT
Looking down from here,
I could see people more clearly.
And you?
I thought
I could stand on top
I thought you didn't care about others' opinions of you.
I don't believe even you
spy on me?
Huh?
Narcissist!
Thanks to you,
You're right.
You've…
You big old fool!
Big old fool?
Sheng Huainan,
will you promise me something?
Okay.
No matter what happens,
you must remember my feelings for you are sincere.
<i>They say…</i>
<i>won't last forever.</i>
ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL 2008 SUMMER

<i>I knew</i>
<i>this would happen eventually.</i>
<i>A week has passed.</i>
<i>He vanished.</i>
TO SHENG HUAINAN: I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT.
<i>The Sheng Huainan from our school?</i>
<i>Why did he cheat?</i>
<i>His dad, right?</i>
<i>They say he asked a rich guy for help,</i>
<i>who's also from our college.</i>
<i>He agreed to help as long as Sheng sat the exam for him.</i>
<i>It serves Sheng right.</i>
<i>Ironically,</i>
<i>came from others.</i>
<i>But I knew</i>
<i>the worst offender</i>
<i>was me.</i>
Mom.
What brought you here?
The verdict was guilty.
Our hard work paid off.
Your dad…
your dad can rest in peace.
<i>Will you promise me something?</i>
<i>No matter what happens…</i>
<i>During those years,</i>
Sure.
<i>Now I'm ahead of him,</i>
<i>but I've lost him.</i>
Luo Zhi,
What are you talking about?
When are you gonna tell him
who you really are?
Where's my diary?
Give it back!
<i>Compared to yours,</i>
<i>Even if I failed to replace that excitement in his heart.</i>
Unlike you,
Yet you slowly got close to him
and destroyed him.
In any case,
I want to thank you.
Once his mother gets better,
and with his consent,
I'll travel abroad with him
and finish school there.
<i>She said</i>
<i>she had received her punishment.</i>

<i>I wanna give you this.</i>
<i>When we graduated from high school,</i>

<i>I don't know if you'll still accept me.</i>
Hey.
<i>We're so alike,</i>
Please help my father.
He's out.

Sunny days,
cloudy days
Sorry.
But I have nothing now.
Luckily,
you still have everything I like about you.
Did you ask for my permission first?
that I love you.
Safety zone.
-What? -It's gone!
Coffee is ready!
Mo?
I don't like anything!
Hey! What the hell is this?
<i>"When we believe we've reached</i> <i>the zenith of knowledge</i>
Really?
"Malarvizhi"?
87% of you went with option B.
Isn't it the freedom…
This movie was made for entertainment,
Almost ten baht per kilogram.
She's getting better.
But mostly bedridden.
We have to check if she's still breathing.
Nart!
- Nart! I'm here. - Mom!
Dad! Mom!
My stomach…
My stomach!
What should we do?
Nart!
- Nart! - What's happening to her?
Nart!
What's happening to her?
Come straight home after school.
Probably in a day or two, he said so in his letter.
Run!
You sure are happy today.
Let's go.
I'll take the trash out.
Yam?
Look, sis.
"Nart."
The one with the mysterious death?
Shut it!
Yad.
Should be done in a couple of days.
You can build a shack there.
Why are you back this late?
If you leave home early, you should be back by evening.
<i>Please protect our family from illness and all things sinister and foul.</i>
What's wrong?
Your prayer was unusually short.
Cotton candy?
Hello, cutie.
Here.
Please.
Just this once.
If I miss it, there might not be a next time.
Fine.
Hey, Yad.
Let's go on the Ferris wheel before they catch up to us.
Nothing. Come on.
Look! The people down there are so tiny.
Yeah. So tiny.
It's great spending time as a family.
Look at those stalls.
What's wrong?
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Oh, Yee.
She was very creepy.
She caught a cold, probably from the breeze.
How could they say you're fine?
Yak!
And all you do is fool around.
Cool.
Wow! You've gotten so big!
You go get some rest, Yam.
Follow me.
How are you?
Harvest season is almost over.
I'm kidding, Dad.
Dad bought fried sun-dried beef for you.
You've been out all day and come home reeking of alcohol.
Come on. Let him eat first.
Now he's a spoiled brat.
I thought they would've taught you discipline.
Have some eggplant.
You're so frail.
Yam?
I'm hungry.
You can't just quit like this, Mun.
Hey, Dad.
Let me talk to him.
Let me.
I'm sorry.
Go pump water into the farm, then come help me in the kitchen.
We can't rely on the workers.
Get out of my face. Piss off!
What's all the ruckus?
I can even hear you from outside.
That's not true, Mom.
Yam is asleep…
Is something wrong?
Yam had turned around and she was staring right at me.
It was like this…
You can sleep with me tonight.
Now, wash your hands and go help Mom in the kitchen.
Don't mind her. You know she's sick.
She's also aggressive.
Come on.
Can't you stay here?
Good.
Let's go, honey.
Didn't you see Mun's face?
The doctor said Yam was fine.
I heard strange noises.
It was a woman's voice.
Nothing.
Really?
Yak,
Okay.
Yam?
Yak?
Yak!
Sis!
No, please!
All right.
Come on.
Hurry back, okay?
I can't find Yam. She's missing!
No!
I told her to hide in the closet before I went out.
Come here.
Look after her.
<i>You two are such lightweights.</i>
Huh? Here.
Fuck you.
You're drunk.
I saw someone there, I really did.
Yod.
Shit.
<i>We lost it.</i>
But I shut it.
Don't worry.
Go on.
This is exactly what happened to Nart.
You know about Nart?
Yeah.
I asked around.
Will Yam get better?
Hey.
Here.
I'll buy pink milk for Yam and fried pork ball for Yee.
I'll find a cure for Yam.
Okay.
You can't order me around.
I'm sorry for leaving you.
you hit on Singh's wife.
and hide on the Ferris wheel.
My stomach aches.
I'll buy you pink milk to cheer you up.
Of course you will.
See you.
You okay?
Yam?
Get the fuck out!
You hag!
Like I told you, Sarge,
And she eats what she couldn't before.
Honestly,
Mom.
Mom, it's Yak and Sergeant Paphan.
Yam?
My name is Yam.
You're stuck in our realm.
What is this, Sarge?
Mom?
What's wrong with Yam?
<i>that she practiced black magic and has gone insane.</i>
<i>No one wants to go near her and risk getting bad luck.</i>
<i>When a bad incident befalls any family, people think it is her doing it.</i>
Chuay…
And please, no more shaman jargon.
Everyone goes to a better place.
Human or spirit, it makes no difference, Yak.
Did it?
that I'm wrong.
it has a new host now.
Watch your sister closely tonight.
You and Yee sleep in my room tonight.
Go now.
Place your hand on the flame.
Yak!
Yos, can you hear me? Yos!
Yak!
Yak.
Damn it.
Yos!
Go in the room and lock the door.
Yam?
Yak.
Yam is possessed.
What's that noise?
Please, don't.
Yak, don't tempt it. It might harm Yam.
Dad, stop!
You don't know shit!
You don't even try!
Hey!
Yam…
Bastard!
Come out.
No…
Yak…
Come here, Yak.
Yak!
Damn it!
Motherfucker!
No!
Yak! What are you doing?
Shit.
Yee!
What are you doing?
"Yad"?
Open the door!
Mom?
Open the door, please.
Come here, Yee.
What?
Mom.
Let's talk inside, please.
Hello.
Listen,
we better go inside.
I'm not done looking around.
Yak!
A challenge is coming your way soon to test you.
I'm sorry,
I know I'm hot-tempered.
Lead the way.
Get out! You have caused enough suffering!
Mom, please come here.
You leave me no choice.
Mom, help me.
Please.
Hold her, Dad.
Listen, Mom! Yam is possessed!
Listen to me, Mom! She's possessed!
Mom, listen.
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm here, dear.
Get out. Kick this old fart out.
How dare you talk to me like this?
Don't!
I did.
I'm sorry, but please leave.
You were like a madman back there.
Even a strong mind will turn violent.
You're strict and disciplined,
but no matter what,
you would never hurt your family like that.
What is that?
Things and organs that link its soul to the host.
Do not touch them.
No!
Stop, Yam!
- Stop it. - Don't, dear.
Yos, Yod, help me.
Sarge, help.
Why don't you use holy water?
Dad and Yos, please stay with Yee.
Sarge,
You must save her.
Yak.
I will.
Come home soon, Yam!
Fucking hell. Why did it target Yam?
This spirit is more cunning.
Superior?
That's what makes her superior.
One among thousands.
An appetizer before the main course.
Yam.
Zip it, Yod.
That's crazy.
I'll close my eyes then.
Young man, where are the sacred bullets I gave you?
Here, ready for action.
Yam? Yam.
She's burning up.
Young man, it's showtime.
Can I say something now?
It's coming!
Yad!
It's gone.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
Did you shoot it?
Wow! You've gotten so big!
Please, don't.
Come get it.
but your freaking family won't mind its business.
I haven't been with a family as fun as yours.
I don't regret choosing it.
So fucking fun!
You're unreliable.
A failure to the family.
Three more bullets.
Your brother?
You can hold their funerals.
Don't forget to invite me.
Hey! Hey, stop!
I reckon you need a perfect host?
Yam?
Bon appétit.
{\an8}PHAHOLPOLPAYUHASENA HOSPITAL
It's really you.
What happened, sis?
Slowly.
My arm…
Why are you crying?
Nothing.
and that I should come home.
I promise to do your chores for you, so you can rest.
Yes, of course.
Yam?
No!
Help! Somebody help!
Doctor!
Yam.
My dearest!
<i>Life is too short.</i>
<i>Let us make the most of this borrowed time.</i>
[man] How do you think your daughter feels, seeing you like that?
Well, Diego, perhaps you should reflect on the
fact that certain decisions were made
I was working.
because that's your phone's place.
But I move it back there, and hey, maybe…
m-maybe that would wind you up too, no?
losing your job, all of it,
Hmm.
She seems to think that
I'm not a good father.
And she… she mustn't think that I'm not a good father.
However,
to work towards you, Diego, not thinking these things about yourself.
Are you watching carefully?
None of this here…
Yes, none of this
would've been possible before right now.
Right now, though…
Right now,
it is.
Yes, good afternoon.
And somebody decided to push me in with everything on, my clothes, my shoes.
Although my cell phone?
Intact.
It works perfectly.
The new Z6.
Amazing is nothing!
We decide whether or not to do something, eh?
You think the decision is mine? We're the doubles.
-Goddamn it! -[woman] Fuck you harder!
Susanna, calm down. Calm, calm.
Okay, Armando. We're listening.
There, they have freedom.
We're only doubling for them here.
Our real selves are there.
Here, we're only doubles.
But here, we aren't forcing you to do anything.
Of course not, because it's much more treacherous as a captive.
I don't decide whether or not to make bread.
Uh, you're a double too.
[Susanna] Fuck you!
as if you have nothing else to do.
-Groceries. Hmm… -[Armando] No.
-No, I have more to say. I wasn't done. -[Susanna] Fuck you! Fuck you!
Um, also, my new play is opening soon.
Uh, I'm pretty excited.
So, who's the new guy?
You got caught jacking off in the park?
Fine, fine.
Sure, but slowly.
Yes, fit in.
Diego…
They don't do it on purpose.
Imagine, a little seal happens to pass by
and finds himself full of shit.
And, of course, the seal gets angry.
And this pissed-off seal, this pissed-off seal is wrong here
The penguin is me.
Listen, two grown men, unless they're a couple,
it's impossible for them to live together.
They're like two convicts. Okay?
Now, tomorrow, you go out and find a job,
b-because the only thing… they wanted was to have me fired.
Yes, of course, of course. The dickhead is always somebody else.
Because you have a daughter,
and then you go crazy, you lose your job,
and it all falls apart.
[woman] Afternoon.
Ciao, sweetheart.
Ciao.
Sit… sit here.
How are you?
Good?
Uh, I… I've got something.
Two juices.
Apricot because it's… it's your favorite.
And look, it's organic,
so, your mom should be happy.
Hmm…
Uh…
Good.
Brava.
Hmm…
Papa, you…
you've lost weight.
Only a little bit.
But I'm…
I'm solid, I'm fine.
Everything.
after re-examining the case of Mrs. Clara Pagani,
-Talk to her, right? -No.
-Say something! -Sh!
your attendance, ma'am, is mandatory,
under penalty of imprisonment.
Okay?
This case is scheduled for review again on May sixth.
But I didn't do anything!
Your Honor, please let me explain about the original sentencing.
-You must not have-- -You and I shouldn't have direct contact.
-It was an accident. -Please move.
This is my life! Is there someone I can talk to?
Hey!
Hey! Hey, Paris! What, are you fucking with me, huh?
I'm an actress.
I've got a show starting next week and there's a tour I need to prepare for.
-Stay calm. -I'm going crazy!
It was an accident.
-It was bad luck. -You refuse to cooperate.
-And won't follow a program. -Another six months in this fucking place!
-I'm normal! -You won't recognize the problem.
before this so-called "normalcy" suggested you attack a judge in the parking lot!
But when I attacked the judge, and even right now, there was nobody to talk to.
Okay, you have a problem.
All right?
It's not a coincidence. You're not here for fun.
-[woman groans] -Push. Now push.
Sorry. It hurts.
-Whoa! -What?
No.
-[man] Good. -I'll make a note.
[man] Good.
Anna is the only good granddaughter I have.
[man] Stop.
[Clara] Hey!
Slowly.
Slow down.
[Susanna] Fuck you, fuck you!
Sorry.
I understand them, because he was just five.
Stick it up your ass!
and the thing is, well,
I never see him.
Fucking stick it up your ass!
I miss him.
And besides the pain,
I feel shame.
A lot.
How does she do that? They treat her like she's leprosy.
[man] Oh!
How long since you saw him last?
Months?
Years!
You see someone like this, instead of helping her, they're afraid?
It could be because they wanted to keep the child
[Paris] Sorry to intrude.
Hmm…
Does this sound possible? Can you do it?
Yeah.
Of course we can, Paris.
Ha!
E-Excuse me.
Do you mind, please?
Huh?
No, no, I can't work like this.
I need some space around me to work.
I have very precise rules in my kitchen and I can't work like this.
[Armando] I cut them in short strips. They're in short strips!
If you're going to complain, at least look.
Fuck you!
-Confirmed. -[Diego] Leave some water in, huh?
[Diego] Okay, okay!
Let's turn it off now, huh?
Eight hundred grams.
I told you no more than 600.
I told you.
No, no, it's okay.
It's too much.
Fucking hell! [gasps]
Sorry. Hmm. I told them to fuck off twice already.
Susanna, don't worry about swearing at two old bowlers.
It's terrible.
Uh, terrible? How?
It's just awful food.
-Move it. -Forget it!
Everyone leave me alone.
Okay? Please? Leave me alone. I can't do this.
Oh…
-Delicious. -Huh! It's awful, it's awful.
-It's delicious. -[Diego] Awful.
This is what you do.
-Try some, Chip. -Oh, oh, I just had a crack... cracker.
-Double? -Ugh!
Gina, here.
See? It's delicious.
See? Hmm, really good.
We are now serving pasta from the trash.
-What are you doing? -We have to serve something.
What are you doing?
All right then. Then serve this!
Whoa! Stop it!
What are you doing?
-Chip, it's a secret, okay? -Yes.
Help me out.
Come on.
Two plates!
Take this one too.
Okay.
Clara, Diego, come here!
Come on.
How so?
Well, no one out there is paid to understand or listen to you,
to demonstrate that you're able to interact with us.
[Chip] A restaurant?
Exactly. A very simple thing, no?
We have the cook already, unless you're not feeling up to it.
[Susanna] Whoo!
And, Clara, since you claim you have nothing to do around here…
[Clara] Mm-hmm.
…you'd be perfectly suited to run it.
-[Chip] Ha! -But why me?
I'm made for something different than the kitchen.
Convince me to let you out.
Diego, maybe tomorrow you'll make us a nice risotto?
[Chip] Ha!
I… I do only one dish a day, okay? Only one.
[Clara] All right, all right.
-And you follow my rules, okay? -Yes, okay.
-Okay. -This thing is idiotic.
You could've told him no. Instead, you said yes.
-Don't freak out on me. -Turn here, turn here.
It's here, here.
[Clara] Okay.
Hmm.
-Hmm… [laughs] -Oh, my goodness!
She's one to talk! [laughs]
Oh, I completely wrecked a… a hotel. Completely.
I wouldn't be offended if someone told--
-Get out! Just get out of my car! -Okay.
-Just leave! -I'm getting my stuff.
And…
-I'm off. -My husband was sick.
Oh.
He had a tumor.
Uh…
I sat with him every day and night.
Day and night.
and I was holding a cigarette.
The curtains caught fire.
It was an accident.
[Diego] Hmm…
Oh, fuck! Huh?
Hmm… Did he die?
Your husband?
Oh.
all the chemo,
the hospitals,
after that whole ordeal,
he got better.
Oh…
Dumped me.
Things were bad.
-Hmm. -And then I was dumped.
Now they say I set houses on fire, you know?
And you… you're left alone.
I mean, really alone.
I know.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm…
Hmm…
Thank you
for the ride.
To use the bathroom?
Hmm, hmm… Go inside?
Yeah.
You want…
You want…
What?
Don't get out.
What are you doing?
You're just
crazy!
CONGRATULATIONS!
WE'RE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR REQUEST HAS BEEN ACCEPTED
AND YOUR RESTAURANT IS NOW VISIBLE ON OUR WEBSITE
the place where madness meets genius,
that you can experience the most amazing, most delicious food

Hey! I… I have aliens to deal with.
the other v-vegetables, put them in the m-middle,
[Clara] "Madness in the service…"
I'll prepare the liquid supply. Over.
"This little gem is hidden away in a secret location
whose address is revealed only when a reservation has been made
the utmost confidentiality and exclusivity."
-Huh? -These are our true selves.
You know, free, they're… free.
What truth is that?
What truth are you talking about? Get rid of it!
Don't you dare! This is my truth. Inside of you is a part of me!
-Enough, Double! -Inside of you--
Get rid of it!
-Get rid of this crap! -My name is Armando!
Leave it!
"Maybe you hate your coworkers,
this magical place will set you right in the world,
D-Do you like it?
-I do. -Ah!
Thanks.
Hmm, let me help.
Hmm.
Excuse me, Papa.
[Diego] Hmm.
Oh, it's Mom.
Wh-whose phone is that?
Well…
They chose it together.
Huh.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Uh, you're a social worker, right?
Okay, so, tell me, do you think it's socially normal
she makes the decisions.
No, he shouldn't decide whether she has her own cell phone.
Am I right?
-Take it easy. -Stay calm.
-Not him. -Calm down.
-Keep calm. -[Diego] Not him. He's nobody!
Nobody!
Uh…
Honey…
I'm sorry.
Look,
I didn't mean to.
I must… have… dropped it.
I… just dropped it.
Paris says I create a hostile environment.
Me. Do you think I create a hostile environment?
-What's wrong? -Diego!
Hmm…
Uh…
-You shouldn't be here. -Leave me alone. I'll call the police!
-I haven't done anything. -You'll never see Bianca again!
-It's breaking and entering. -I haven't done anything.
I think you were the one who locked three bolts,
The only things broken were Damiano's. How did that happen?
He's living in our house with Bianca?
-No, no. You don't have a say. -Say it.
You will not see Bianca.
-Not even with social services. -No, don't say that to me!
-Well, I'm saying it. -Don't say it.
[Clara] What's going on?
Clara, please, n-not right now.
This madman broke into my house this morning and destroyed everything!
So, then, no, Diego couldn't have done it.
Oh, no, what if it was burglars?
Maybe they stole something.
Huh?
-Clara. -And you must be Diana.
May I call you Diana?
-Susanna! -[Susanna] Sorry.
You whore!
-Excuse her. She has Tourette's. -Oh.
between everyday life and life at the center.
Right, my love?
-[Clara] Ciao, Diana. -Ciao.
-You lie just like a professional. -No. Don't use that word.
The point is she thinks you have changed and you're with a nice, super cool girl.
It's been ten years since she apologized to me.
You're welcome.
What? The bright side?
Sure, you and me
are having fun today.
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Quack, quack! Quack, quack!
Whoo! [laughs]
Look, you do everything with this pedal.
You step down to accelerate, take your foot off to brake.
-Okay? -But… but I'm afraid.
Just pretend that's the guy in the nursing home and just, bang!
Bang!
Just one minute!
Move!
Anna?
Where did she go?
Anna?
We need another ten tokens, please.
Adelaide!
What's she doing?
Adelaide!
Adelaide, what happened?
Help us out!
What's wrong?
Okay? Hmm?
[man] Hello.
Afternoon.
-De Pascalis. -Afternoon.
-Tell me what happened. -Nothing!
Just like I already told you a thousand times,
and then she drops dead over some silly bullshit!
I had so much fun today.
Ciao.
Ciao.
Hey, so, did you know that Susanna has been going around saying,
Everyone, everyone.
So what?
Well, so, this information has reached Paris, right?
Tell me why I should care about Paris.
Two more meatballs. They fuck hard!
-Huh? -She told four old guys to fuck off!
She's like this all day long.
She goes around saying, "They fuck hard!" to the whole center.
Oh!
-You called me crazy? -Calm… calm down.
Yeah.
I am not crazy!
I am not… crazy!
[sobbing] I'm not fucking crazy!
And I'm tired!
Tell them that they're crazy! Tell her that she's mad!
Uh…
I…
I don't really believe you're crazy.
Oh, that's funny.
Coming from the man who broke into his wife's apartment.
No. No.
-Yes. -That house is m-mine!
In my bedroom,
You're right.
-Somehow I'm the one doing the violating? -Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. You're right.
I'm so… afraid that… Bianca
up and left.
She disappeared overnight and I never saw her again.
I don't even remember the face of my own mother!
My father has 300 photos,
but there's… not… one
of my mother!
Marilyn.
Uh, Marilyn?
Marilyn Monroe.
that she forgets… my face, you know?
-Fuck, it's pouring. -Yeah, it is.
Over there!
You're soaking wet!
It's pouring down.
Hello?
Good evening.
Uh… Yes.
Uh… No, I'm sorry.
I believe we're all booked up for the next six weeks.
Yeah.
No.
Yes, please call back.
Hmm, nothing.
What do you m-mean, booked up for six weeks?
-What is? -Nothing.
Are you… pulling my leg? I was standing right here.
I might have written a few…
A few?
of a restaurant that doesn't exist,
but like our restaurant if it did.
Right, so, are you making up things about the cooking lab?
Doesn't sound great put that way.
Wait.
Hang on. Take a look.
Understand?
No, no.
So, basically, people write these reviews
without ever setting foot in the restaurant.
-But how can you do that? -It's easy.
-You can't do that. -Yes, I can.
-My God! -Paris asked us to run a restaurant.
He didn't tell us we couldn't fantasize.
And pretending feels good to me.
Come in. It's open.
May I?
[Clara] Yes, come in!
Okay.
-Come in. -[Diego] Ciao.
We've gotten over a thousand emails.
What emails?
Uh, no, then leave out that "we" part.
Okay.
Anyway, we went all the way
from last place to 1,500th place In three days.
Wow!
How come Monroe?
Thank you for reminding me.
So, basically, I had this relative. She was my Russian second aunt, right?
And at some point, she opened her own restaurant in Russia,
where she was performing almost every night.
She was identical to Marilyn Monroe.
So I thought, "I'll call it the Monroe."
Actually, M-Marilyn had blonde hair and light eyes.
No, a brunette who went blonde, raised her forehead and got a nose job.
-She was blonde with light eyes. -No, no.
In fact, she had black eyes and a mole that was drawn in.
Watch the movies.
[Clara] No, I make the dishes to photograph.
-Oh, with shaving cream? -[Clara] Yeah.
That's fake food?
My God!
Impressive.
I learned it
from an artist friend.
I w-wouldn't put those berries there.
Beautiful.
-Which one? -This one.
-[Clara] What should we use? -What is that?
Uh, we'll use your foot.
-No. -Yes.
-My foot is hairy. -No!
Right.
-[Clara] Gross. -Okay.
-Like that? -Yes, stay right where you are.
-Good. -How does it look?
Impressive.
-Yes. -Incredible.
And then this one.
Hey, how do you see me?
In the abstract, in general.
Well,
I mean, I suppose you're someone that appears skinny,
then up close, if you look carefully,
BEST LEADING ACTRESS
Uh, commercials,
a little film, television.
Oh, well, um…
One minute.
Are you watching carefully?
Yes.
Right now, though…
Right now…
it is.
This shoot, it was for a Korean director
in a studio that was just rebuilt in Germany,
in East Berlin.
That makes sense. Yeah.
-No, no. -Yes!
-Just look! -Uh…
He says it's a really fancy place with waiters in black.
It's called the Monroe, right?
-Yes-- -Look. There's your picture.
See?
with substance and class all in one."
Who's the chef?
Uh… I am.
Well,
that's…
Hmm… No.
-[sniffs] -Tell her some bullshit.
-Isn't this one beautiful? -I can't. I'm not like you.
I'm not comfortable just telling her some crap while looking into her eyes.
Okay. Okay. Do whatever you want to do. I don't need to help you.
to resolve a situation, okay?
and open… open up the Monroe, so Bianca can come in.
-That won't work. -Yes, it will.
It's mine, the Monroe.
Bianca might actually be proud of something I've done, you know?
The Monroe doesn't exist. It's not open.
And fuck me for telling you about the site!
-You're only capable of this… this shit! -Whoa!
Because you're a bald-faced liar.
-You're a bald-faced liar! -What do you want?
-Not me! -Fuck, fuck you!
Fuck you, fuck you!
-Fuck you! -Whoa!
Pick this shit up.
What are you doing?
[Clara] Great.
Well done.
Calm and collected.
A perfect gentleman like always.
I'm at least doing something.
Yes, probably in that drawer over there.
If Paris sees it, we're fucked.
You asshole!
You asshole!
-[Diego] Let me do it. -Oh, sure, the plumber!
-[hissing] -Hurry!
-Ugh! -Oh!
[Double] You ruined the mural!
-Okay, Armando… -[Susanna] Fuck you!
-It is not ruined. -They're coming.
Yes, 20 centimeters of water, then all that splashing!
Fuck you, fuck you!
-Fuck you! -Okay, just calm down.
[Chip] I hope they're okay with it all.
And listen to how we feel inside.
Chip, please, go ahead.
Okay, well, my job has been lost.
And it's creating quite a bit of anxiety for me.
Clara, you find this funny?
and we get a break.
I'd say it's more of a relief.
[Diego] That's crazy.
I mean, three years, that's how long you've been here
and… you can't even sit in the circle.
Diego, you seem nervous and mad too.
Well, you see,
if we don't go there,
[Diego] N-no.
There are those who have nothing to lose
b-because some people have nothing.
What's important?
the chance to do something different, something personal and shared.
So, basically, everything.
not 17?
Thank you.
Who's that?
Clara.
[Clara] Open up.
Why should I?
Okay, I'm opening, I'm opening.
I'm… I'm opening!
-Hmm! -Wait a minute.
You live with your dad?
It's a temporary situation.
I am being bombarded with calls. Some guy called three times in one day.
Christmas!
And… so what?
And so…
And so… it's yes?
We're opening!
Hey, hey, hey.
-Do you trust me? -No.
-Do you trust yourself? -What are these questions?
-No, I don't trust myself. -Bad, very bad. You should.
Only three problems, as far as I can see.
Okay. Two, I make one dish per day.
Not two. One.
Nothing. We tell them nothing.
They'll treat them terribly.
Right.
I want to start with a carbonara…
[Clara] "Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the inability to communicate?"
"Yes, the inability to communicate."
"That ugly thing that takes hold of us and makes us feel tremendously alone?"
CLOSED DUE TO FLOODING
Can someone tell me…
Wow!
Cool, huh?
We made a couple changes.
I'm noticing suspicious behavior in the restaurant. I repeat…
-Fuck you, shithead! -Armando!
That way, you can really unleash your talents.
Fuck you!
[Clara] "With this in mind,
in which the most disruptive performances contemporary art has to offer
is combined with the usual refinement of flavor that our chef is known for."
"The artist Gina brings the question of our inability to communicate to life,
I'm just tidying up here.
[Clara] "In the figurative art space,
"A dialogue both desired and denied
you'll be treated to a performance
that will make you ponder the violence and sexualization of modern life."
That seems like the whole purpose, no?
[chuckles softly] Okay.
Why don't you do it?
for one night, let your other self out, the stranger, the madman."
"Whoever it is, let them join us for an experience like no other."
-Don't worry. -[Clara] "Maybe you'll discover…"
Don't worry.
-Mission accomplished. -[Clara] Okay.
I'm turning everything off.
-Oh! -[Susanna] Fuck you!
Thank you. Ha!
Situation out of control.
I repeat, situation out of control.
I'll continue to be undercover, but I'm going to need reinforcements.
Are you okay?
What's going on tonight?
No.
It's so humiliating.
[Clara] Susanna…
Susanna, keep your head up, don't worry.
And I guarantee that tonight no one will mind.
I guess carbonara for everyone.
-Five beers. -Fuck you, bastard! Fuck you!
Sorry.
Five beers.
They're incredible.
It's all part of the performance. Okay? Good.
You don't tell us! I know there's something you aren't telling us!
What's going on?
-What's happening? -He didn't put salt in the water.
Diego got angry. He didn't do it because there's a plot.
There's something you're not telling us, and I'm gonna talk to Paris!
-Okay? -[Clara] Calm down.
No, calm down!
-Leave… leave him alone! -I want my mom!
-And you're all scheming! -[Chip] Mama!
-I wanna see my mom again! -Calm down. Give me that.
-[Clara] Look at me. -I want my mommy!
-Look at me. -[Diego] Stay calm.
Uh… Thank you.
What, have you lost your damn mind?
-He's threatening me! -No, no, I'm not!
-He's threatening me! -I'm not!
I am totally lucid.
Lucid? You were holding a giant knife! Jesus!
-It's Paris! -[Clara] Fuck!
-[Susanna] He heard the screams. -Call Paris. Tell him Diego threatened me.
-These are my witnesses. -I'll give testimony.
Not true! It's not true! Susanna, stop, stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
Stop it!
-There's a conspiracy. -[Chip] Yes.
No, there is no conspiracy!
-Yeah. -[Diego] Okay?
To earn…
to travel to Papua New Guinea…
so we can all be free.
Isn't that right?
Yeah, yeah.
-[Diego] See? -Diego's telling the truth.
We're all a team, huh?
Great.
-It'll take ten minutes. -Impossible.
Nobody expected this many people to be here.
-I have another 20 orders. -Go buy some more for us.
-I go? -Yes, you go.
-Now? Without cover? -Yes.
-Yes. -Ha!
-A what? -Just chop the strawberries.
They're starting at the finish, with dessert.
There, that's perfect.
Yeah, and now…
Coffee.
Cream. Hmm…
He's doing his thing.
W-watch.
Strawberry and… biscotti. And voilà!
We present our dinner "au contraire." Okay?
Not with that expression. Be confident, calm.
Believe in it and they will too, I promise. Understand? Hmm?
Au contraire, au contraire.
Let's go, let's go! Go!
-Go! -Hmm.
Okay, we can do this!
Bravo.
Can you tell me what's going on?
Marketing.
It's the outside coming inside,
and we're managing it, no?
Dinner… au contraire.
May I say something?
-[Diego] Yes. -Dinner was incredible. Our compliments.
Thank you.
Good night. Hmm.
Hey.
What's up?
[Diego] Hey.
We really did it!
Here, here!
Phew!
Follow me.
I'm pretty sure
this is illegal.
Of course it's illegal.
Come on! I've done this a million times and I've only got caught once.
Only once?
Wow!
This is enormous!
[Clara] Five, four,
three, two,
one, zero!
-[Diego] You lose! -[Clara] Stop!
I'm exhausted.
y-you're a genius.
Why's that?
and look what happened.
It wasn't my idea.
I read it in a magazine about someone who had done it in London.
Really?
[Diego] …a really good job.
-Oh, it didn't? -My husband worked in finance.
And he was never home, he was never around.
And he just ignored me and so, I just…
…made up all kinds of stories.
Sometimes they were auditions,
All fake.
Y-you made them?
I, obviously, wasn't there.
I accused him of cheating on me with a colleague, which wasn't even true.
I just wanted him…
[Clara] Really terrible.
Then, when he said he was breaking up with me,
I told him…
"One, two, three."
Because if you don't, you're not credible anymore, right?
But then,
-The dog burned to death. -Oh, shit!
I fucking suck!
I really suck.
N-no.
And there goes the magic!
Who?
Uh, well, the "normal" ones.
L-let's do something.
Be the good guys.
You're gonna stop… making up nonsense.
Come on. Yes, yes, listen.
And I will stop breaking things. Yeah?
Just between us, okay?
We'll try.
Okay, we know.
A croissant.
Yes?
For eight?
Name?
Yes?
[Susanna] About two hours.
I'm very sorry. Fuck you, bastard, fuck you!
Yeah, we'll wait.
-I'll put you on the list. Name? -Emanuel.
Gina! Gina!
-Get off me! -Get up!
-He's the real me! -Enough!
All part of the performance. All part of the performance.
How extraordinary! Extraordinary!
-It's him! -Outstanding!
That's okay. It's normal.
It makes sense. It's your first contact with the outside.
It's a chance, Chip. An opportunity.
-Oh God! -We have a sponsor.
Oh, great, boss!
I like "boss." [chuckles]
Oh, we've made the top 100 restaurants in the city, out of 13,500.
13,501 to be precise.
I mean, this is unreal.
We've had complaints from people in the area.
to play music here, right?
Hey.
[Clara] Look.
Tonight… Bianca's coming.
That's great, no?
And today's menu?
Pasta with tomato.
Pasta with tomato?
Ciao.
I made your favorite dinner.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Delicious, Mom!
Enjoy your dinner. We'll be back soon.
Good evening, everybody.
um, because…
Well, because he knows why.
They're taking her away. Really, they're taking her away. It's a signal.
Hey, what's up? Why did you stop?
Hey, look, that was very, very nice, what you were doing.
-[Clara] No. -Keep going.
-Come on. -No.
-Come on. How does it go? -Please, don't. "I couldn't aspire."
-Huh? -"I couldn't aspire."
I told you! Hmm…
It was a joke. Excuse me.
-[Susanna] Whoo! Whoo! -Excuse me.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Ha ha!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
-Your singing's awful! -Look who… who… who's talking!
And… and that hairpiece?
But…
But I made a real effort.
I sang your song.
Well, it wasn't all me.
I did.
-Hmm. -Oh God.
-I'm sorry. I thought… -No, no.
Forget it.
It's… inappropriate.
No, no, for sure, we shouldn't…
-Because I'm pretty sure we should. -Uh…
Well, with all the
problems I have, I mean, should I add you too?
Oh, so, I'd just be another problem?
worry that if I'm with someone like you,
And there's no review from the judge.
-Asshole! -Oh!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Oh… Oh, fuck!
God…
I'd like to speak to the manager, please.
And there.
And there.
There's three.
Evening. Is something wrong?
Hello. Good evening, miss.
Are you aware that playing music in a restaurant requires a permit?
Sorry, sir. We have the permit.
No, it bothers me that someone doesn't trust me,
-Here! -What happened to you?
Making a joke? Why?
Yes, it's fake. Okay, no more music in here.
Hey, guys, get them to stop playing right now!
Take care of them.
Don't give them your IDs.
Set an example and be the first to show your ID.
-Don't give them your ID! -Give me your identification now!
There's a fire!
Stop them at the door!
[Double] Fire! There's a fire!
-Fuck you, asshole! -Come with me!
We're all free! Everybody!
-Bianca! -Everybody's free!
-Papa, what happened? -Nothing. I scratched myself.
Come on. Through here.
Okay, come on.
Oh, so, you're interested?
-Nineteen thousand euros. -My God!
You falsified a permit.
But his passion was pills, chemistry.
And there were, well, snowballs, ecstasy.
Terrifying visions, a lot of horror.
He visited his friend and the little brother
Bright colors, very expensive.
Of course, the kid says no because he cares, it was new.
And somehow, through a kind of game,
As soon as they're pinned down,
he takes the helmet anyway and their wallets.
and takes them all like there's no tomorrow.
but he finds he can't articulate the words, can't seem to speak at all.
He feels scared.
and wanted to destroy the world,
I realized that if I used one ounce of that energy
to do something other than being pissed off,
In that moment, I decided and I did it.
It's incredible. And you had them all working.
And then you destroyed everything.
Here.
What does "residential" mean? I sleep there?
-Is Diego coming too? -No, he'll remain here.
Because that young man
is always there.
Good luck, Clara.
[Clara] Excuse me.
Hello.
-Anna? -Hmm.
I was awake.
Sure.
I'd fall asleep if I was surrounded by all this too.
Well, um…
Merry Christmas.
Tomorrow? No.
Well…
it's not only my face that's shitty.
I'm just…
all wrong, I suppose.
I tell lies all the time just because.
That's all.
But to me, you are the best thing that has ever happened.
I'll see you tomorrow for some meatballs with red sauce, okay?
We like the idea of exclusivity.
Good, I think.
What does it pay?
Uh… tortellini?
Did you make them?
until they were red like your face right now!
And maybe add a couple of hits while we're at it, why don't you?
Look, Diego.
Focus on what you do have.
which, trust me,
it was Vietnam.
Uh…
And this person,
this someone, who is me,
for the person you are,
which is an enormous, immense
pain in the ass.
All right, you're a little unhinged,
but we've made it this far, right?
And that's not for everyone.
Trust me.
I just don't feel like taking this job by myself, you know?
[sighs] All right, then draw another line.
This young lady,
who, yes, has her own faults,
but she supports you.
So, look,
keep her close to you.
Keep her close.
Hmm.
Dinner's from 8:00 to 9:00.
then brings you back at 3:00.
They want you downstairs in an hour for group.
And welcome.
Thank you.
Good, but a bit temperamental,
Come on in.
-Hello, ma'am. -Sit down there.
They're really lively, and unfortunately, my daughter brought them to me.
Ah, yes, very much.
You… disappeared.
Uh… Uh…
So what?
Hey!
Huh? You said I'm not good enough for you, right?
[Diego] Listen, listen. Hey!
Listen, listen, listen.
I… was missing a piece.
Okay? I've always been missing a piece, okay?
Now I've… found it.
so you… you can't disappear, okay?
You said it.
You said I was a problem.
You said that we were two problems, we're two fucking problems.
-A big mess. -No.
They make two who understand each other,
Of course I don't mind.
And you too,
I don't understand all the crap you say,
because to me, you're fine.
And you're fine, really,
just how you are.
We're still two problems.
Like pizza with figs.
instead, but you don't understand how…
Hmm…
Uh…
Oh…
Uh…
Hmm…
And, please,
Uh, if that's how you react, I'll…
Hmm…
Well, yes.
Yes, but I… I like it,
because you're… you're really soft.
Yes.
- Let us begin.
- Why a Newton's cradle?
- It focuses the mind.
- John Doe.
- He's ex Special Forces.
A soldier's soldier.
- Just a man trying to do his country proud.
- So explain this to me, doctor.
Expands the processing power of the brain.
has remained virtually stagnant
But with every technological leap forward,
- I've heard your pitch before,
but what makes this version of the chip better?
- Interesting, you can make him do things?
- We can plant ideas.
We didn't tell him to eat that apple,
and his brain took over from there.
- Just wait,
turn it on.
sort of like a smartphone unless you remove the battery.
But now we're- - Fully engaged.
- The chip helps him analyze the surroundings
and come up with a solution to whatever problem he may face.
- Lion,
crocodile,
snake,
tiger.
- Impressive.
- I've seen enough.
Turn him off.
Shut it all down.
- What?
- Security breach!
- Turn off the chip!
- I'm trying!
- Abort the subject!
- Do it.
- Hit the kill switch, abort.
- Hit it, abort!

- That's why I'm still alive unlike him.
So what just happened, doctor?
- A minor setback.
- The new and improved chip malfunctioned.
- Chip didn't malfunction, the subject malfunctioned.
- Now I understand what went wrong.
They'll get him.
- Yep, they're doing a bang up job already.
- This didn't happen with any of the female subjects.
John Doe was supposed to follow orders.
The chip leaves you no other option.
- Then perhaps he still is.
- Where'd he go?
- Somewhere without cameras.
- Wherever he is,
he somehow just access the mainframe.
- Precisely.
Wonderful.
- Cut off all communications.
Done.
- Where's my team?
- Approaching now.
Subject is not present.
He's not going anywhere.
- Can we still track the subject?
- Not at the moment, sir.
He has no one, that's why we picked him.
- Just understand doctor,
- You have an uncontrolled,
dangerous military asset offsite.
- And you are who again?
- Well then Ms. Agent,
The smart people are talking now.
- Enough!
We're gonna activate the original subjects.
- I wouldn't dream of it, Senator.
- I thought meeting in dark, scary alleys
in foreign countries was my thing not yours?
- Why come to me?
- Because Ylan said I could trust you.
what needed to be done.
One of the chip program financiers just tried to sell me
but I think you win.
- Oh my goodness, an expense account, why not use it?
Get some food, maybe a drink.
And then go to sleep.
I'm waiting for someone.
- And he's late.
Have a nice night.
- Yes,
and now you have one.
Thank you.
I'm John.
- Jane.
- Two more of whatever she's having.
What's your story, John?
- Well, so far so good.
- All right then, Mr. Super Spy,
what am I thinking right now?
- How do I get rid of this devilishly handsome stranger?
- You're half right.
- Which half?
- The chip is a prototype.
before they implanted it in your head.
as badly as yours?
- Mm, touche.
So who was this poor guinea pig?
- Han Wynn, a Vietnamese operative
was the original subject.
like all the ladies were.
- Cat.
- Wait.
- Yes, doctor.
- Benson wasted no time putting Han to work.
It was supposed to be a simple file retrieval job,
but the mark came home,
and the chip took over and put her into survival mode.
Once the threat was eliminated, the chip disengaged
and Han realized what she had become.
in her head?
- But you do?
especially if it allows me to spend time with you.
Okay, that was a better line.
- I wouldn't take it that far.
before my friend gets here?
to go back to your place before your friend gets here.
Really?
for that to happen.
Thank you.
- Aren't you breaking some super spy code or something
And so did Han.
Her chip didn't come with all the bells
and whistles mine does.
No tracking or safety protocols either.
- Technically, yes, but really the doctor did
at the moment he put that chip in agent Han's head.
- Dr. Cain, the one who invented the chip,
the one responsible for the whole program.
- Oh, that Dr. Cain.
The secret super spy doctor.
The one who apparently likes quoting George Bernard Shaw.
- But I've never heard of Senator Benson.
to get a super chip implanted in his head.
- Not even close.
That honor went to American Indian, Ylan Romero.
After the Han disaster,
the doctor was allowed to choose the next subject.
Also like me, he had no family, no connections,
and no one to miss him,
except for his old friend,
the tribal police chief.
- It won't be televised.
- Welcome to the program.
He rescued someone who needed rescuing
and exposed the whole program to scrutiny.
- The disappearing secret hero.
- Marena sure thought so.
- An assistant to one of the chip program's financiers,
who stumbled across something she wasn't supposed see.
not all of them legal.
Maybe Marina knew about some of them,
maybe she didn't,
She knew how dangerous Ketrov could be,
but she had made her decision.
- Give her to Terezin.
He always liked her.
for a test run.
- But unlike the original chip,
the one implanted in Ylan did have tracking
and safety protocols,
so they were able to reign him in
before things got too outta control.
I'll give you that.
- All good stories do.
- No, not yet.
I was still another upgrade away.
- After Ylan's shaky start,
they chose a civilian Bindi Lamar,
supposedly saw her in a cafe.
The thought was that if they could train someone
a true sleeper agent.
- Fox,
wolf,
spider,
cheetah,
hawk.
And they wasted no time
in testing out the new recruit.
Mr. Titit, one of the program's other financiers
needed some files still on the old fashioned way
So they sent the unassuming Bindi
to do what they trained her to do.
they were confident that the chip would fill in the gaps.
And they were right.
And she didn't go rogue?
- Oh, there were more?
- Senator Benson called them his crows
because they could be anywhere,
always watching, always waiting.
- This guy sounds like the ultimate creepy uncle.
- But unless you're secretly
I assume that your program started recruiting men again.
- They did, as you can guess,
but limited city of crows.
He wanted to push the technology forward
and finally make a super spy.
I was a finely tuned weapon,
and that was before the chip.
I had but two loves,
serving my country,
and the bottle.
That's how the doctor recruited me for the program,
with the help
of the doctor's very convincing assistant, Vivian.
- You'll be better than before,
smarter and more skillful in every way.
You'll have the calculating power
of the most advanced microchip ever invented,
assisting you in any and all decisions you may face.
There won't be anything you can't do.
- I'm honored and lucky to be chosen.
- There is no good luck, only good planning.
Being a super spy, who wouldn't want that?
to my place because Vivian picked you up
and took you back to hers.
- Actually it was my place, Vivian and I went back to.
- My thinking exactly.
You haven't even touched your drink.
But being sober has a way
- Abort!
- So when I was escaping the doctor and his facility,
or just previous attempts lying there waiting for orders.
And I didn't care.
Oh, hell.
- Wow, I guess your upgraded chip
really is the best version.
- I'd like to think so.
- Well, considering we're still in this bar,
not back at my place, I'd say not so good.
I'm just a lowly office drone
who spends her days sending pointless emails.
Yes, this is Jane.
Answering phones.
and now attending a boring outta town business conference.
sipping a glass of wine
and getting ready for bed.
- But instead, you're in the hotel bar waiting for a woman
is entertaining me.
please continue.
plugged in the damaged tablet I swiped
and sent out a message
to activate all the other chip owners.
Actually to use the doctor's term,
I sent them all a suggestion.
do as trained and strike back those responsible
Bindi was back at the cafe,
when they would permanently deactivate her.
Mr. Titit used her first,
The next suggestion went to Ylan.
Ylan knew that after rescuing Marina,
his days were numbered.
to go after the target I sent him, Yuri Ketrov.
- Hello.
Victor!
- Oh, this story got exciting.
There's just one problem with it.
- Only one?
- Well, let's start with one.
and you say you have the most upgraded chip there is.
Why aren't there soldiers or spies kicking down the doors
to my place, time's ticking.
- Not a girlfriend,
just someone from the business conference.
Last minute meeting, I suppose.
Well, to answer your question,
my chip was temporarily blocked.
That's why they can't track me
or enact any protocols right now.
Oh, so out of all the recruits,
only yours was blocked?
Sounds convenient. - It wasn't.
Soon after my chip was implanted,
I met an agent, a real one,
or rather, she met me.
- I apparently no longer drink.
- Thanks to the chip I presume.
none of it good for you or the country.
something the doctor and Vivian forgot to mention to me
or the others.
the effects on your brain would be catastrophic.
- Why are you telling me this?
- We have common interests.
I'm not even supposed to know about your existence
until tomorrow when the doctor provides me
with a demonstration of your talents.
- Then how do you?
- Former employee of your new bosses
suddenly grew a conscience.
She also provided me with an access code.
- They can track me?
- Not yet, when they fully activate your chip tomorrow,
That is until their techs figure out
that we change the access codes.
- What you do best, you serve your country
and eliminate the threat.
- Abort!
It's not working!
before I sent out the suggestions
was buy myself some more time.
ever since, trying to crack the problem.
- Anything? - Soon.
- You use this.
It'll damage the chip.
And fry his brain.
- Something like that.
- So who takes out creepy uncle Benson?
You? - No.
to your story.
I need a little help with the happy ending.
I bet you do.
- But fortunately, you already helped.
- Senator Benson's up in your hotel room.
- That's why you're here.
- One that's conveniently near this hotel.
- There's my favorite girl.
I've never even heard of Senator Benson.
- Oh, he's hard to forget.
- You lost a shoe.
- I think you prefer the term super spy.
- Oh, right, right.
- As Agent Wilds put it,
the chip does a lot more
none of it good for you or the country.
- What?
a memory block doesn't seem too crazy.
now you're saying I'm one of the doctor's subjects?
Oh my goodness, an expense account, why not use it?
Get some food, maybe a drink,
and then go to sleep.
- You're one of Benson's crows, Jane.
This has been very entertaining
and probably one of the most surreal nights of my life.
assuming there really is one connected to these keys.
You deserve it.
- Right, well, it's getting late
and I have to go find the woman
I was supposed to meet here tonight.
- The one from your business conference?
You know this because you're super smart.
because Sarah Wilds was never gonna come here.
- I never told you who I was meeting.
How do you know her name?
All right, I'm leaving.
Drinking some wine and going to bed.
- Goodbye John.
- Ladies room?
Thanks.
Just a story.
- Mm, there's a lot of those around.
- Right.
- Whenever you're ready.
Maybe I have a shot with you yet.
had better pick up skills than you do.
- Ouch.
You know, the doctor would never let us go, Jane,
not until the next upgrade,
- You see Ketrov's body out there?
It's pretty damaged.
- Not everything, I bought myself some more time.
- I'm glad, use it wisely.
- I plan to.
I need a car.
- Have fun Mr. Doe.
in this beautiful hotel bar.
- No, your Lamborghini is stolen.
She already did it.
You and I are the only ones left.
- Don't worry, she's not touching you.
when I hacked the system.
send them a memo, request it back.
- All the program's financiers are dead.
You think you've won now?
who wants more power over other people.
But the chip program begins and ends with Dr. Cain.
He's the final target.
- Let the agency keep the tablet, John,
I already cracked your codes and made new ones.
Done.
- Not all of us.
- Oh-uh.
- There's no good luck,
only good planning.
- You sound like Dr. Cain.
- Not for long.
- Okay.
- Oh, hello, Vivian.
Came to pick me up at another bar?
- We were dead the moment that doctor put that chip
- But we don't wanna kill you,
Doctor will never let you go,
not until the next upgrade.
- He's all yours.
- Good night, John.
- Good luck, Jane.
- Let us begin again.
- Brain activity, minimal.
The damage done to the cerebral cortex is catastrophic.
He's not going anywhere ever.
- Good.
Guess he was right.
- He even got into your bed.
why keep him alive at all?
And that data,
I can use to create the ultimate upgrade version.
- There's always more money to be found.
- And more subjects.
what were John Doe's last words?
- He wished me good luck.
there's only good planning.
- Exactly.
John sent me a suggestion.
- No, mine was to kill the chip program.

PRISON 77
Are you okay?
What's your name?
Juan.
But everyone calls me Ruby.
<i>-Get up! -Okay, Juan Vicente Lopez.</i>
<i>Out. -Juan Vicente Lopez.</i>
-Who's Juan Vicente Lépez? -That's me.
He's just a kid.
You shut up.
This way.
Move!
-Back again? -What can I say?
-The place grows on me. -How long did you last this time?
One week, my record.
-Bend over and get up. -Turn around.
-What did you do this time? -Nothing.
Would you give me a job?
Contagious diseases?
Flex.
Lice?
Democrat.
I won't go near you, you bastard.
Turn around and flex. Spread your legs.
Good evening, Domingo, sir.
Get dressed. You too.
I'll give you 250 pesetas for the suit.
It's not for sale.
Listen. Mr. Domingo is right.
Get dressed. You're going into sanitary period.
Two weeks of isolation to make sure there's nothing contagious.
Take your blanket and mattress.
Not the mattress. That's 250 pesetas.
-I don't have any money. -No mattress.
Take the bucket. And don't spill it, that's your water until tomorrow.
-What for? -I've been here for three days.
I smell bad.
Use the bucket. No showers in sanitary period.
You look familiar. La Ladera, right?
The ghetto by Montjuic.
I have a good memory. You need a plate.
Do you smoke?
-I don't have any money. -Pay me when you can.
I trust you, we're neighbors. There's no hurry.
It has a leg.
JUMP TO COLOR
When do I get out?
-When is the trial? -I don't know.
-Can it take long? -I don't know.
You stole nearly one million pesetas.
997 thousand.
That's not right. I only took 50 thousand.
A salary advance.
you convinced your friend, the Head of Accounting.
Who?
Miguel Ferran Requesens.
He signed the complaint, along with his father,
-the company owner. -That's a lie.
It was his idea, he proposed it.
And they all say you were spending beyond your means.
And you aren't.
I am not a criminal.
I can't get six years for that, it makes no sense.
I want to shower!
I want to shower!
I won't eat.
Not today, tomorrow or ever. I won't eat that
I've been like this for over a week.
With no idea when I'm getting out and sleeping on this.
They asked me to give you this.
HANG IN THERE, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.
-What time? -Tomorrow.
I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm leaving tomorrow.
In back, third block.
After you.
Come in, he doesn't bite.
And you, get up. Where are your manners?
Manuel.
This is your bed.
Or should he sleep with you, Pino?
Listen to me, Manuel.
Understood.
I know you made trouble in sanitary.
This is my side.
When the blanket is closed, it's closed.
Or not in the fucking mood. Can you read?
Spaceships, the future, stuff like that...
20 pesetas per novel.
-I'll cut off your balls. -Breathe on one, he says.
He's a dandy.
Understood?
Understood.
Good.
Clean this up.
Of course he is.
And your sister?
-Outside. -Why doesn't she come inside?
Lucia, talk louder, please.
I'm not a thief, Lucia, believe me. Tell your sister.
One year? Two?
Please, talk to your sister.
Tell her to come and see me. She's all I've got.
Hey! Let me go!
-What's the problem? -I was just robbed in the yard.
Four inmates.
There were also two guards and they did nothing.
That's 300 pesetas.
The stamps for the complaint form.
Then no democracy.
Take it easy.
Come with me. I can give you clothes.
You're not alone.
Thank you.
-I can't pay for the clothes. -You don't have to.
We have a fund for inmates.
You have a gumboil.
My tooth really hurts.
I have to cut and drain it.
Hold still.
Come in.
This is Agustin, he manages workshop.
Martin Puente, from the union.
-He just came from Madrid. -You're not the only one
-How long have you been here? -Three weeks.
Open up.
Does this hurt?
Now don't move. It's just one second.
Or sexual condition. Hold that.
You can read, right?
This is from Carabanchel.
The initials mean: "Prisoner Rights Association."
They're organizing to request amnesty.
-A pardon. -A general pardon.
What do you want me to do?
The whole prison should know.
We have to be united.
I'm leaving.
-What are you doing? -I'm treating him.
Everybody out.
Antibiotics.
-Five days. -Thank you.
Only one, see him?
Anarchist.
Socialists.
This guy with the book...
Communist.
Forget about it.
-Who is he? -Marbella. He runs the 6th.
And Horoscope, his psychic. The Brazilian.
Pelé's first cousin.
I know the kid. What's he doing here?
Favors in exchange for money. Nothing good.
Open up, it's Blacky!
I'm coming!
Maribel's communion is next month.
Her third communion in two months.
She's a huge believer in God.
I'll call you when the shift is over.
Well, and they pay us, even if it's peanuts.
In here you get by on very little, everybody's poor.
Why are you here?
How many years?
Half screwed.
-They say. -Depends on the day.
Some days two, others nobody.
True or not, nobody messes with Pino.
Not even that bastard Domingo.
There must be a reason.
stashed away here in the prison from a heist or something.
Listen, Agustin. This is my friend Manuel.
I have someone down next week. Come by.
You can learn to stitch soccer balls.
Time to put the country to work. Stick around.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
The local priest signed a paper. It says I'm your girlfriend.
No.
Could you please leave me alone?
I'd rather stay.
I asked around. You could be here a long time.
Asked who?
If it's not too expensive. I'm studying.
I know you're lonely.
If I don't come, nobody will.
You've never ridden an elevator in your life.
-So what? -What do you mean, so what?
Riding is one thing, installing is another.
Why not? And this guy too.
They've given amnesty before, and here we are.
What's my problem?
You're a pessimist.
Yeah, yeah, don't laugh.
Not today, Pino.
Do it again.
The bottle.
Answer me, damn it.
Sooner or later you'll be just like me, you got that?
-Okay. -Just a matter of time.
- Tourist, you're a tourist. -Don't point at me.
Okay, that's enough.
Well?
Like new. Look.
"Bye, Blacky." "Bye, Antonio."
"Yeah."
"They let you out?" "Amnesty, Antonio."
"Look at those pretty shoes."”
"Pretty, huh?"
Almost nobody can write. Raise your head.
What's going on?
Put this away.
That looks much better.
Rodriguez Fuentes, Diego, downstairs with everything.
Gomez Méndez, José, downstairs with everything.
Silence.
What's up, Blacky?
57.
I know you're awake, Pino. Read me something
to help me fall asleep.
No human came to say goodbye.
I crossed the platform and entered the capsule.
The iridium thrusters ignited.
And suddenly... time stopped.”
NOVEMBER 1976
-Let's go! -What's going on?
-Move it. -What is it, Ramon?
You're hurting me! Where are you taking me?
-Ramon! -Let's go.
What's the problem, Ramon?
A tunnel in the kitchen.
They're questioning him.
He's not his friend.
Fuck!
Emilio Simon.
-Do you know him? -A jinx.
Inside.
Lunch!
Lunch!
To compensate, we'll leave your cells open at siesta time
Where is Blacky?
A heart attack during the interrogation.
What, you don't care?
You don't care about anyone?
They beat him to death!
It was them!
Murderers!
Nobody move!
Get up!
Back to your cells!
If you don't want trouble, leave.
Amnesty!
They treat us like animals!
Amnesty, freedom!
Amnesty!
Freedom!
Please, step back. I have to speak to my client alone.
Name and badge number, please.
Court-appointed, I know.
<i>Manuel Gomez Garcia, right?</i>
I'm Arnau Solsona. I represent the March 17th Attorney Group.
We read the flyers.
And we want a new country too, outside and in prison.
Your court-appointed lawyer won't get you out of here.
And you will?
At least we'll try.
And I'll try to get your trial moved up.
This here is only a complaint.
As you know, the government has released political prisoners
but they've forgotten us.
Which had never happened.
But if we want amnesty, we have to make our voices heard.
Andrés.
If they knew, things would change.
They could throw a camera over the wall.
-That's right. -Luis.
-Hunger put most of us in here. -With the shit they give us.
With what I can eat.
Please.
Walk.
Wait outside, keep watch.
Good afternoon.
That PRA thing.
I want you to sign me up and the whole 6th block.
I want them to defend us too.
You can't be here.
He's not in workshop.
Or him.
What's the problem?
Fucking great.
Manuel Gomez.
ANSWER ME OR I'll COME SEE YOU. I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
SO YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING.
THE FUTURE WILL BE HERE VERY SOON.
I just saw the lawyer lady you sent me.
It's the first time in my life someone read my whole file.
She knows more about me than I do.
I'm glad.
Me too.
That meeting you all had today...
What meeting?
The secret meeting in workshop.
Some of them were not the type you're looking for.
-What type are they? -Bonnies. Queers.
Wackies. Flounders.
Are you crazy?
-Do you recognize him? -No.
Do you?
Roll call.
I told you there were snitches.
Where is Agustin?
They took Agustin!
Silence!
They kidnapped Agustin!
Everyone back to your cells!
Now, everyone!
For the PRA!
Agustin! Agustin!
PRA
Not until you bring him back.
He was transferred to another prison. He's not coming back.
The warden has to authorize that.
-Get him. -He's not here.
-Long live the PRA! -Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
-You okay? -I'm okay.
You're losing a lot of blood.
A lot of guys have cut themselves.
I'll bring the press. But first we treat them.
-First the press. -Treatment.
The press!
Call the press right now.
Do I have your word?
No! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
A doctor!
A doctor, anybody, now!
I'm going to read the PRA manifesto.
Please, a few words.
The injuries were voluntary
in response to a situation that is unjust and unsustainable.
of the unfair conditions in Spanish prisons.
We believe that, as the social outcasts we are,
that for having been judged
-I wasn't going to come. -No?
PRISONERS HARM THEMSELVES AT LA MODELO
You're glad I came.
You left us hanging!
With bombs.
We have to continue the legal battle.
Manuel.
AMNESTY - FREEDOM PRA
Hi.
Sorry, I missed the bus.
-Good. -I brought you reading.
It's a very funny cultural magazine, with no fear.
Much better than the newspaper.
And this is for Pino.
I think they're all at the Ministry of Justice.
-I want you to stop coming. -What?
Manuel!
Manuel!
We're doing a hunger strike.
Nobody believes in the PRA.
I do.
It's your fault I'm here, Pino, not mine.
-You're the same as me. -Don't point at me.
Don't point at me.
Blacky was right.
You think you're a tourist, but you're just like everyone else.
A common prisoner.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah, Juanito.
I've got pardons here for everyone.
You're all pardoned.
Amnesty and freedom.
End of isolation.
Get up.
Let's go.
Eating.
-Is the strike over? -No.
Why are you eating?
Want some?
You should.
We're going to escape.
PRA?
MAY 1978
Where are you two going?
Migraine.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
-When are you leaving? -Tomorrow.
The yard.
and 30 feet horizontally to the sewer pipe.
We have three weeks.
From the elevator itself.
We need to find props.
Me neither.
It's Ruby.
Turn on the light.
And you?
What, you're not glad to see me?
I'm shutting the door.
A bunch of nuns?
-Who? -The blisters.
Have you got anything to lose?
I bring good news.
The government is approving the Law of Proportions,
which means they're reviewing sentences for a variety of crimes,
Your suit, I had one just like it.
When is my trial, Arnau?
Thanks for everything, Arnau, really. Thank you.
The sewer pipe.
We've reached the sewer pipe.
JUNE 1978
Your clothes, for later.
Thanks.
I was from there too.
I liked seeing the city at night.
Daniel Morales Ruiz.
The new Manuel.
Portugal, France, South America...
-What will you do? -Install elevators.
I don't know either. There's time, right? I'm young.
There's nobody there.
Where are they?
The wall...
Hey, stop!
Open the gate.
-I don't have the keys. -Open it!
-I can't, I swear. -You shouldn't be here.
-Want me to cut you? -Ruby.
I'll take him.
Move, damn it!
Inside.
Stop!
Stay there, don't move!
Don't move!
Two tickets.
Thank you.
What does that matter now?
You're free.
Goodbye, my friend.
Good luck.

Yeah.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Thanks.
Mr. Frodo.
Bye... Samvise.
Samvise.
They'll sell everything to those people from Chicago.
Maybe they'll give us... more funds.
They're Americans they'd just take over the project.
I need you to help me activate it.
Even if it works, we don't know where or when it'll take us.
We only have to set the range.

It's been a year since the accident
so they want to dismantle the laboratory.

At home.
Are you sure?
Flebo couldn't wait.
Hello!
Wait.

It's when.
Oh God!
A one-way journey?
What do I think? How do we get home?

There's no signal. There's no signal.
We have to change our clothes. Everyone's staring at us.

Where are you from?
We're from the future. My name's Max.
I'm Greta.
Flebo.
My name's Lena.
I'm from the Montanari Brigade.
Follow me.
An antifascist organization.
They were like the Resistance.
There's a rumor going around.
Mussolini is building a powerful weapon.
He wants to win the upcoming war.
It's a time traveling machine.
A few weeks ago we found a little box like yours.
The fascists were looking everywhere for it.
It's an object that can contain a lot of information.
Yeah. Right...
We grabbed some clothes...
- That looks like shit. - I'll find you something.
Max, what are you up to?
Their bodies were never found.
Do you think they used the machine?
That the phone belongs to...
If they did, that means...
Going somewhere?
Those fascists you work with are the criminals.
They're huge.
You can't call those who feed you criminals.
I thought there was a war.
What about H.....
Hitler?
Not yet, but soon.
Why are you whispering?
Long live Mussolini!
Long live Mussolini!
Duce! Duce! Duce!
Take this, you look a bit famished.
Especially him.
Thanks.
Don't mention it. Good luck.
Video games.
They're like movies,
Tell her one.
He acts stupid, but he's actually a tech genius.
He is an inventor.
Go on.
So, there's this plane crash, and you fall into the sea.
- And down below... - You fall?
It depends who's playing.
But you fall in the sea and there's an underwater city called Rapture.
That this guy built...
You die?
But you're born again.
You start the game over again, you redo the missions until you win.
First it was the Church, now we have Mussolini,
But it's only a video game. It's all made up.
No one invented slavery.
What are you transporting?
Timber.
You may go.
Can I help you?
I don't know anything. All I care about are my chickens.
- If you let me... - Then why are you sweating, old man?
I don't know. It's probably my age.
You yourself said I was old.
Get out.
I gave them a ride to the beech grove.
That's all I know, believe me.
No! Not the hole!
Not the hole!
Wait here.
It's my brother's phone.
- It's true then. - What?
What's going on?
Nothing, Montanari.
The battery's dead.
Can you fix it?
Turn it off...
- Remove the battery. - Yeah.
Look at their innocent faces.
They look like children, that gives me hope.
Maybe the future isn't as bleak as we imagine it.
Take it easy! Easy, this is normal.
Is there anything in it, a homepage?
No, just numbers.
Brigade! Take up arms!
You were followed!
Get down!
Fascist bastards!
Max, grab the phone!
Run!
Fuck you!
Here. Take this.
It's no use.
They're our future.
Tell me you've understood.
I'll take care of things here.
Death to Mussolini!
This way.
Go on. Quick!
Where's Max?
Search him.
No! Let me go!
Max.
Beo...
Oh God!
Beo?
Yes, it's me. Look at me, look at me!
How did this happen?
How did you get here?
Your jacket.
My jacket?
Now we're here...
why did you leave without telling us?
Your brother is more selfish than you think.
Doctor.
But why?
He started hanging on my every word.
She wants him to go back and cancel the pact with Hitler.
Hey, no! Leave him alone!
The committee was right.
You are a crazy old woman.
The past is now my present.
I also said
SCIENCE DEPARTMENT
Is that it?
What stage is the machine at?
There are still a few adjustments to be made.
But with the latest modifications,
I'd say it is greatly improved.
The regime has assigned her a state-of-the-art laboratory.
Come on! Get to work!
Now, thanks to that code, Chronos can be completed.
It contained the data of the electromagnet force used for the first journey.
By using it as a point of reference
and equating it to the coordinates of our arrival,
she can now build a time-space tracker.
A what?
So you didn't know where you'd end up?
No.
Come here.
Mr. Frodo.
Max...
It's already incredible you used the machine on your own.
What's that "fly" thing called?
Intruders!
Stop!
Welcome.
You need to try harder.
Or your dead companions will be disappointed.
You're alive!
Easy, easy.
Quick!
What took you so long?
Let's get out of here!
Oh, my God!
Haven't you ever seen a time travel movie?
We came from here, but now we're here.
And this is the timeline. If something changes here, now,
and the one we came from will be completely wiped out.
If Mussolini wins the war, it will change history.
Are you saying that...
That, dear Lena, is what we call a spoiler.
So this spoiler is a good thing?
No...
According to my calculations,
And hand Chronos over to Mussolini.
Where's this weapon being built?
At the new National Research Council, Science Department.
- I don't follow you. - He's talking about my father.
Fuck, fuck!
No, no, oh fuck!
- Fuck! - What's wrong?
It won't start.
No, you can't park that there!
There's no one in it. Whose truck is this?
In here.
Watch your steps!
What the...
Guys...
Let's just sneak off stage.
- This way. - So?
Flebo...
You play the piano, don't you?
Me?
What about the one from "Money Heist"?
Will that do?
Here we are. Right....
Good evening.
One morning
O bella, ciao
One morning
Do you know it? I've never heard it.
And found the invader
O, partisan
Take me away from here
O bella, ciao
O, partisan
Take me away from here
I feel I'm about to die
And if I die as a partisan
The Jews, probably.
And who's the partisan?
I'm the partisan, you are. We're all partisans.
O bella, ciao Bella, ciao
Bella, ciao, ciao, ciao
And this is the flower
Of the partisan
Who died for
Freedom
Bravo!
Hooray for the partisan!
Partisan, partisan, partisan!
Am I the only one who's thirsty after the concert?
How much longer?
Forgive me for saving your lives!
Water!
Dunk him!
It's my safe place.
I can't have a drink because I've already had two?
As an honest Italian citizen I have a right to.
Where are you going?
To pee.
No, I'm sorry.
What fools!
Beo!
Beo, Beo, Beo.
What's wrong?
Remember a few years back,
and Uncle Lodo came to pick you up from school.
It was strange, right?
Because Dad always picked us up on Fridays.
- He strained... - His groin.
You have to tell me now.
Max...
Traveling
in time and space is a bit like going underwater.
The seabed is the past.
Because there's a limit.
A limit?
Max...
There are things we can't change.
And the past should be left as it is.
And what happens if you stay too long in the past?
You drown.
Not you.
That makes no sense, we're both here.
I know.
Beo.
Beo, tell me this is...
Beo, I beg you, tell me it's all bullshit.
It's a huge pile of bullshit!
We fucked up by coming here.
Basically, we have to save the world.
The best thing you can do is try to enjoy it.
It makes me feel like Dwayne Johnson, except for the hair.
Have you ever seen a movie where Italians save the world?
You, I don't even ask.
That'd be awful, right?
So?
Shall we save the world and then go home?
Do you know how much that truck cost me? It was my truck!
You're waging war on him! You're crazy.
They slaughtered my friends like dogs.
Lena.
It took you long enough to open the door, smith!
How can I help you?
Vulcan.
Right...
I'll be honest with you, smith.
and do you know why?
Because it makes people lazy
and deprives them of their greatest virtue:
strength.
I don't know... take gunpowder, for example.
There's no physical clash, there's no... strategy, there's no...
training.
Just...
We are looking for a group of antifascist kids.
Let me go!
All right.
What?
Once we were men of honor.
But you're not a man.
You're a smith.
And a smith cannot answer back to a general.
Let's go!
This way!
Grab the kids!
They're always having punch-ups!
Dad!
alone!
And you don't get that I'm not alone.
We can't take the above roads.
- The above roads? - We'll go underneath.
If we go through these pipes,
we can come out at this point.
Under the building. There's a hatch here that only opens from the inside.
We need someone to get to the other side.
Then the others can enter from there.
Someone has to get in to ensure the others can.
And how do they get in?
It can be reached from here, through this pipe.
We need someone skinny.
I'll go.
Right?
If there was only someone here with the strength to fight, always.
tourists.
You're the kind within the photos.
Greta is...
Greta.
But meeting Greta has given me an idea.
That one day this will end.
Who's going first?
Geez, what a stink!
Quick, let's go.
Doctor.
Has Chronos been loaded?
Excuse me, who are you?
What were you doing?
Faster!
Run!
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was a bit impulsive, I didn't think that you...
Hold it!
- Where did you learn to shoot? - Remember the video games?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's Chronos? Tell me!
Mussolini?
Is this it?
I can, if I can predict it.
Get Chronos!
Fuck!
Help!
Vulcan!
Stop!
Max!
Max!
Give me that machine.
No!
Beo...
Beo!
They got you!
No. No!
- Max... - Please, no, no!
Is anyone here?
Max...
Max!
Max, no! Max!
Max, no!
- Here comes Jon Snow! - No, that's not...
Fuck...
Max...
Why didn't we return home?
We?
Of course we can return together, otherwise all this stuff...
We won.
You didn't make it.
Did I die?
Is that Chronos?
we can return to the moment when we won,
and you and I can go home together.
Then I...
I won't have to...
Beo, don't you ever think about us in the past?
About your Max?
I am here precisely because you're coming back to me.
You can't change the past.
Or did you?
Come here.
Come here.
We did it, didn't we?
We saved the world.
And now you must go home...
to Mom and Dad.
Okay.
Beo!
I have to...
I'll think of something...
Remember a few years back...
Because Dad always picked us up on Fridays.
Then...
she got us in the car, took us home and...
He strained his groin.
Why have you dragged that up?
I need to tell you something but I don't know if I should.
It should work.
Please, tell me I'm not your grandma...
No.
No.
It belonged to my grandma.
No spoilers.
Lena.
- Proud of being a shrimp? - Proud of being a shrimp.
Don't you start talking now or I'll get emotional.
We'll go back to the moment we were gone.
Are you ready?
I think so.
Max...
I know.
Farewell...
smiths.
Farewell, voyagers.
THE VOYAGERS
- Early start, Professor? - Yeah.
I guess we're not following dive protocols today.
- Thanks, Gitundu. - Right? OK!
Sorry!
How you going, little fella?
Your home's dying
Abby?
Hey, you've got a call.
Oh, really? Thanks.
Hi. Is this Abby Jackson?
Yes.
This is Dr Levine from
the Longboat Bay Hospital in Western Australia.
Apologies about the different time zones,
but your mother's here with us.
She's suffered a stroke.
She's awake now and stable,
but she's unable to speak at this stage.
- And letting me know. - Thanks, Abby.
Abby? Everything OK?
Something's come up.
Abby?
Abby!
Come on, sleepy head.
Mum, I was dreaming.
Congratulations, Abby.
You're awake.
Come on.
You know what that means?
Come on!
Maybe not this year.
Mum!
- Mum... - Come on.
That's where you're going.
It's just a warm-up.
Abby, you're a big girl now
since you were 18 months old, yeah?
No, Mum. Please don't.
No, Mum! No!
Alright?
Just glide.
I did it.
Come in. Come here. Come up.
Oh, I'm so, so proud of you, alright?
Now I know you can swim that deep...
Yeah.
OK.
- Come here. - I did it.
So this here is Robber's Head.
Now, the reef splits apart here
so there's caves and crevices who knows where,
far too deep for you and me.
Right. OK.
And, remember, we only take...
That way, they'll still be here
for your children's children to fish.
Ohh!
Mum, get in the boat. There's something down there.
It's OK, love.
- It nearly got me. - Come on, Abby.
- Abby, Abby, take a look. - No, Mum.
- I thought it was a shark. - No.
He's big enough to eat your arm off.
Must be old to grow that big.
Yep.
Old and wise.
You must have made him feel safe, Abs.
He'll always be safe with me.
Well, the only way to make sure he's safe...
You see, gropers,
They don't tend to leave.
Blueback.
We'll call him Blueback
Blueback?
I like that.
- Thanks. - See ya.
What are you doing here?
Briggs, you lunatic.
Don't 'professor' me.
- You alright? - Yeah, thanks, Briggs.
Give me your bag.
The first stroke wasn't so bad. You know Dora.
She said she felt "a bit ordinary" after a swim.
and that was in April.
Then...
Looking for whales again.
A bit sly, the Jacksons.
Anyway...
it doesn't look too good, Abby.
They said she might not speak again.
We'll see about that.
So what do you reckon?
Check out the abalone guy?
The compressor's on.
Mum, you can't just get in someone's boat uninvited.
He's taking too many.
Macka!
Hey, Macka!
Come on, ya old dog!
Macka!
You right there?
Sorry to board your vessel uninvited, Macka.
Oh, you don't look too sorry.
You're taking too many.
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's pretty simple, really.
Well, I'm a simple bloke
so that's the best news I've heard all day.
Anyway, I know this looks a bit crook,
but it's not as bad as it seems, honestly.
Some of this stuff's from Henry's.
Yeah, alright. Shouldn't they be on ice, then?
- Jeez. - Sure is warm.
in a sustainable manner, of course,
in line with all the relevant health and safety protocols.
- He's not that scary. - OK.
Mrs Jackson.
Ted Costello.
Well, Ted Costello, I'm sure you'll enjoy it
Door was open. I called out.
Worth taking a look.
No rush, though.
We're not going anywhere.
We're here, Abby.
Thanks, Briggs.
I can take it from here.
Come on, sleepy head.
Mum?
It's me.
Here.
Hey.
Come on.
Thanks.
OK.
Mum.
Do you remember the drawings?
This was my first.
Mum?
See ya.
Been getting many fish out there?
Fish are where you find 'em, Merv.
Right!
You Jacksons, I tell ya,
- Hi, Merv. - Morning, Merv.
Come on, kids. Let's go!
Any ideas?
Yeah, it's a banksia.
Red. Blue. Yellow.
It's a Banksia attenuata,
Go on. Try and draw it.
Briggs! Abby!
Wait here.
What's going on?
They need to dredge the reef,
Mum said they need to pass
an environmental assessment.
The development isn't even approved yet.
- Abby! - See ya, Merv!
Wait for me.
Hi, Mum!
Hey. Good day at school?
The salmon's in, at last.
Yeah, alright. Thanks, love.
- Hey, Dad. - G'day, mate.
- Abby. - Hey.
Come on. I'm gonna show you something.
Don't be late!
It's a blue whale.
This was just a calf, I think.
They must get pretty big, hey?
Like, way back.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Have you seen one?
Sort of. Not really.
Dad says we're killing a big hole in the world,
all of us...
I'd like to see that.
Yeah.
Sorry, Mrs Jackson. Hey, Dad.
Sorry, OK?
Briggs just wanted to show me something. That's all.
Well, the good news is...
we get a free feed.
- Yeah? - We've been invited to dinner.
Hey, Jimmy!
Abby!
You were with a fella.
- Hey, Macka? - Yeah?
I assume you've been invited, yeah?
Well, I can see the flame from a mile away.
Good one, Merv!
- Whoa! Hey! - Oh, Macka!
What's going on?
What have we got here? Ten-ball shooter!
Thanks, Macka!
Ooh!
There we go. Point it upwards, OK?
Nah, next year.
Aww!
- Macka. - Oh!
Hey, hey, hey! Here we go!
- That's so cool! - Another one!
Briggs, hey!
Yeah, baby!
Here we go, everyone!
♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo! ♪
Here we go!
♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo! ♪
Yeah, Merv too, hey?
You think he likes her?
Sorry.
That was a bit thoughtless of me.
No, no problem with me, Briggs. It's fine.
Everyone loved your dad.
He was a pearl diver, right?
Yeah. Yeah, he was.
He headed north for the pearl season every year.
Mum said he could come back with, like,
He worked so hard
just to make a life for us.
And then one year...
one year came around
They just never found his body.
A tiger shark most likely.
I mean, that's what they said.
OK.
What have we here?
A letter from the prime minister
and a copy of your letter to him.
Did you get any takers?
OK. One last thing.
The dolphin,
Remember this?
Mum! Seriously!
I was a coward.
It killed me.
Save our bay!
- You can breathe? - Yeah.
It's not too tight?
Yeah, that's it, Merv.
Save our bay!
OK, we're in. It's done.
Take it to the ocean, chuck it in.
OK.
Run, Merv! Run!
Come on, Dora.
You've had your fun. This is pointless.
You know what's in this truck?
- What? - Ammonium nitrate.
That's what's in it.
It's your bay too, mate!
- Settle down! - Save our bay!
Save our bay!
- Thanks, Ray. - See you.
Will do.
Hey.
You were there today?
At the protest?
You know I was there.
No, I didn't.
there is no place for cowards, Abby.
I'm not a coward, Mum!
Yeah? It didn't seem that way to me.
I'm not a coward!
And your dad would've agreed with me!
Hey, Mum.
Day's not over yet.
Should we go find the old blue bandit?
I'm not so sure.
I'm not sure if I'm up for that.
Yeah.
Hey, Macka!
Hooroo!
- Look out! - Hello.
Oh, pirate ducks at that.
Hey, you know those fireworks
you had the other night, yeah?
Oh, no! You gonna call the authorities?
I was thinking about it.
How you doing down there, Macka?
Nah, I'm not talking about you.
A shark? What kind of shark?
A great white.
Pretty great, pretty white, pretty big.
They say I'm a bit tapped, ladies, but I'm not that mad.
Seems pretty sensible, Macka.
Oh, look out. Mum's agreeing with me.
"Dear diary," hey?
Before you go...
Groper, western blue.
Scoffs my popcorn apparently.
We don't catch groper.
Well, then, what are the crabs for?
Well, because every old man
likes a snack every now and then, Dora.
You know about Blueback, don't ya?
Blueback?
Righto, if you reprobates are finished,
this beautiful little snack I prepared for myself,
and then I'm gonna go...
Take it out west somewhere.
I'm big enough and old enough to look after myself.
Besides, I've always thought when the time's right
Know what I mean?
Isn't that right, Abby?
Yeah.
Righto, back to work.
Take care, Macka.
Well... not today.
Bye-bye!
Um, it's a marine encyclopedia.
Mr Carlisle lent it to me.
To prepare for the new school.
Western blue groper.
Achoerodus gouldii?
Yeah.
A leafy seadragon.
A Phycodurus...
a Phycodurus eques.
And the southern rock lobster,
Jasus ed... edwardsii.
Yeah, I spoke to Merv the other day.
Yeah?
And a dead leopard seal came in from Antarctica.
So there's something going on.
you know, read all these signs.
It's a puzzle.
With an answer?
Yeah, there's always an answer.
Storm's coming.
Hey, Mum!
Macka's still out diving. He should come in.
Let me see.
I think the compressor's stopped.
Abby, come on.
Macka! Macka!
Macka?
The compressor's low on fuel.
- Reckon you can get it going? - Yeah, I think so.
Macka? Macka?
- You understand? - Do you think it's a shark?
Stay on the boat.
Come on!
Come on, please!
Come on!
Won't be needing that.
Was it that shark?
So he's dead?
Yeah, love.
He's drowned.
I'm sorry.
This isn't gonna be nice, but, um...
I want you to tie off that rope.
I'll go down and secure him
OK, alright.
Thanks for checking. OK. Bye.
Oh, Mum...
Gitundu.
Hi, Abby.
How's your mum?
OK.
And the reef? Any news from the survey?
That's why I'm calling.
The drones came in this afternoon.
The bleaching...
Miles of it.
It's dying.
The whole reef will be gone.
We really need you here.
I'm not sure.
About anything.
Abby?
Sorry, Gitundu.
Never seen them before.
Come on! Your new school can wait.
Poor old Macka's only just left us.
Blueback, he... he's a big target.
With a boat that size,
they should be fishing in open water.
This is the most stupid and dangerous thing we could do.
You told me, Mum, "To do nothing would be twice as stupid
"and twice as dangerous."
True.
Abby!
Hey, Mum, come up here.
It's not just abalone.
And so many undersized ones.
And these fish...
How can they do this, Mum?
I'm gonna go down and see what they're doing down there.
Bring it up.
Bring it on.
- Mrs Jackson. - Costello!
You're gonna fish the reef out completely!
Do you realise exactly what you're doing here?
Just ignore her.
of marine life, so your boss
can push his agenda through council.
Any of you blockheads know which ones they are?
No? Didn't think so.
Well, I'd be asking my boss if I were you.
Hey, Mum, there's someone on Macka's boat.
Alright. Let's get out of here. Come on.
Hey.
That boat's still good in open water?
Yeah, sure is.
Smooth as, even in a storm.
Even in a storm.
- You feel safe on it? - Yeah.
The man who owned it took it out every day.
Well, his name was Macka.
And people called him Mad Macka.
Maybe I did too.
But I liked him.
Abby?
She helped me pull him up.
Well, I'm grateful for what you both did.
Did you know Macka?
He was my dad.
Abby!
It's yours.
Macka's son. He said you could.
Oh, wow! What do you reckon?
That's an engine, alright.
Alright? A bit rusty, but we could work on it together.
Make it feel like yours, then.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait.
OK, where are the tools?
Abby?
Hey?
Here. Look.
Looks just like him.
Do you know that the sea holds more artefacts and remnants
What's this?
Careful.
Oh! It's an otolith.
I've only seen a picture of one.
- There? - Yeah.
Well, it grows a layer each year.
He was really old.
Like, really old.
Well, you see, all blue gropers are born as girls...
and they start off green.
And it's only when puberty hits that they change colour
I want to show you something.
Someone, actually.
- Yeah. - Yeah?
Alright. Come on.
Now, the throttle will flood the engine
Yeah.
Come on.
What'd you think?
Oh, that was amazing.
So cool!
Hey, Mum, you alright?
I'm gonna see you back at the house.
Maybe the protests slowed them down.
Just make sure everyone's there in the morning,
and I'll see you after the council meeting, if not before.
I think she looks better.
Yeah, well, happier.
She still hasn't said a word, though.
The doctor said the chance of another stroke is so high now.
Yeah, I know.
Time is all we have, Abby.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
It's fine, Abby. We were fine.
You know Dora.
with everything you were doing,
We are very proud of you.
Hey, Dad.
How you been?
I'm worried.
I don't know if Mum can stop them this time.
And I wish I knew how to help.
Mum.
Well?
Well...
I just need to finish this proposal
for the council tomorrow.
It just...
Come on. You know you can visit.
Maybe live with me over there.
If I leave here, this house of ours
will be bought by developers and Costello will win.
Look, I want to save the world's oceans, Mum,
and I can't learn everything I need to at the school here.
Abby, this is your home, alright? You were born here.
You and me, we can make a difference together.
my whole life?
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You look good. The uniform, all of it.
It's just...
It's really hard letting go.
to protect the diversity of species
that we have right here in this bay.
This diversity, tell us about it.
What threatens it?
I live on the bay so I've seen what's going on
Your mum still banging on in there?
I'm up next.
That's how it works.
She speaks and then I get
Fair enough, don't you think?
You and your mum really think you can stop this.
- Don't you? - Yeah.
That's not how it works.
You see, governments, they pay attention to short-term gains.
They need to get re-elected.
I'll vote.
To stop them.
To stop you.
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's just stealing from...
stealing from our future.
My name is Abby Jackson.
Hello, Abby.
This here is a redlip morwong.
And there are three different types of these seadragons,
three,
And each and every one of them
And we have larger fish,
like the western blue groper,
or Achoerodus gouldii.
as havens from the weather along the coastline.
These pictures show us the many species unique to this bay,
documented for the first time,
I mean, it's a gift to us all.
Well, we all welcome your work, Abby,
Hang on a minute, Abby.
Down at Robber's Head!
Abby?
Abby?
Abby!
Abby!
You stupid girl!
- They've got spear guns, Abby! - I had to save him, Mum!
- They could've killed ya! - I had to save Blueback.
- There was no other choice. - Oh, Abby!
He just wanted to play, Mum.
I was running out of air.
Well...
- Well? - Well, I hit him one.
Don't laugh, OK?
- It's not funny. - Oh, God.
Oh, get on the boat. Come on.
with the spear guns and the fact that that kid
was nearly killed by one of your blokes.
So what's gonna happen now?
set by their licence.
aren't typically used for fishing abalone
is... is reckless endangerment.
And today?
- How'd it go after I left? - Well...
There was one, though.
Yeah?
It was you that did it, Abby.
Not me.
It was your pictures.
Your research.
Just one vote?
Oh...
Just one for now.
then another,
then another...
They're here.
Where's Dora?
- See 'em? - Yeah.
Thank you.
Humpbacks!
Patient as ever.
Right here.
You kept them, Mum.
Where were they?
He never came back, did he, Mum?
I truly believed he would have shared
Come on.
When you were born...
and lowered you gently into the waves.
Jack and me.
We come from water.
Well, you saved him, Abby.
That's the main thing.
You ever notice that just before the sun sets,
beyond the horizon...
the sun burns even brighter just for an instant,
lights up the whole sky?
Yeah, it does.
One last beautiful hurrah.
Then it's gone.
looking out across her beloved bay,
to celebrate the life of Dora Jackson.
Dora devoted her life
A safe place at last.
She wanted more of them, other havens along the coast,
she was content with everything she had achieved.
And as we say farewell to our dear friend,
I thought I'd play a very special song
for fearless Dora.
Thanks, Briggs.
No worries.
I love you.
Abby!
Gitundu, you would not believe it here.
My mum's marine reserve is thriving.
I saw a huge pod of humpback whales.
Every day, there are whales off the shore.
And it's beautiful.
Great.
Where do you want to begin?
- Let's start right here. - Yep.
Take a good close look at what we're fighting for.
Amazing. We'll be there.
Thanks, Gitundu.
I love the violin.
The hardest things in my life is probably my family's health.
Like, everybody is always getting sick back-to-back.
Like, "Oh, we have to go to the hospital for them," and stuff.
I just have to get these medicine for them."
You know, I can understand, but it's like... it's like, "Okay."
Like, "I guess I'll play by myself."
Don't even jinx me with that. [laughs]
[supervisor] Let's see.
There's four departments.
There's, uh, brass repair, string instrument repair,
uh, woodwind instrument repair
and piano shop.
With the strings, uh...
Please," uh, "repair as needed."
So in this case, old peg has to be removed,
and instrument goes back to student.
And if you leave a crack open, the instrument buzzes.
It can be really frustrating.
It's hard to find that last little buzz in the cello.
Some of 'em come from a place of love and support.
The emotional broken things
and the mental broken things are more difficult.
You can't glue that back together.
That takes time.
It was 1975.
You have to remember that this was a different time.
So, from 13 years on, I tried, uh, my best to not be.
And I thought I was broken.
That buzz in the cello.
Or just kill myself, you know?
And my mom taught me...
and if you stop, there's no music.
Whatever you do, don't stop.
Keep going.
Persist.
You know.
I wasn't broken.
Don't need fixing.
Met my husband. We became dads.
And we've been a couple for almost 23 years now.
And so I'm still here.
Alive.
Free to be kind, be loving, be authentic.
So... [chuckles]
But we try to make at least the...
the playing-of-the-instrument part as good as it can be.
I'd be playing sousaphone,
[giggles] "I don't know how to play anything."
Like, in my home, in my neighborhood, we could never afford it, in my opinion.
And they'd always tell me the same thing.
Which means "either a tuba or you" in the house.
And I'm just like, "Oh." [giggles] "Well...
But luckily, I had a sousaphone at home from school.
It's emotional 'cause, like, when you think about, like,
and I'ma find a way to somehow make music my career,
my passion, my living.
Give a sonic wash.
I have a big jar.
I call it the treasure jar.
And it's all the stuff I have found inside the instruments.
Batteries, marbles, candies.
Pencils, erasers.
It's tiny, about this big, and it's all hairy.
It's like secret communication between the kid and myself.
What kind of story that instrument can tell me
My story, it was a big adventure.
Big, scary adventure.
I was born in Mexico in a town called Morelia.
You are smart. You're strong.
Go fight for what you want."
Since I was little girl, I wanted the American dream.
So, I decide I wanna go to United States.
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it.
We travel all night.
my jaw was dropped.
So like, "Wow. It's even better in life than what I was imagining."
My daughter was three, and my son was six.
I start working at music store in Thousand Oaks.
One week."
and preparing the musical instruments for him to get 'em fixed.
So after a week, he say, "You know what?
My son, he said, "Mom, I would like to try clarinet."
Twenty dollars a month, the rental.
I was... I was single mom, remember?
And... I couldn't afford it.
We were so poor.
"This is not American dream."
Few years later...
An opportunity opened in L.A.U.S.D.
"You need to go there.
there were 12 men and myself.
I was scared!
But, I remember my mother.
You're smart. You're strong.
Go fight for what you want."
If everything go okay,
The test was the most difficult experience.
The pistons, they need to go up and down.
The casing and the piston have to lock inside with a little guide.
And they fit like a glove.
Any little dent, any little scratch, even if it is dirty...
it won't play.
I did the test...
and I went home.
I didn't even want to wait for L.A.U.S.D. to give me the results,
because I was almost sure that I wasn't gonna get it.
I thought, like, "Put that behind me and don't get excited or anything
because"... [smacks lips] ..."it's not gonna happen."
Yeah.
And then, I get a phone call.
when I saw my kids that night.
It was like, "Yes, we did it.
Yes."
Same bench. I never change.
Music changed my life, for sure. For sure, it did.
My school gave me my saxophone. They gave me a case.
They gave me everything I needed.
This is a beauty.
and always messing up.
The saxophone helped me in a way be more disciplined.
I have to shower.
When I'm feeling tense, when I'm feeling sad or angry,
the saxophone...
...calms me down.
[supervisor] With the woodwinds, um, we have a saxophone.
So on and so forth. "G-sharp key completely fell off.
Complete overhaul."
[Duane] Ah, let's see.
They all got keys and screws and rods and springs.
It's kinda almost like a puzzle. When ya find a leak, you fix it.
You might have to take the instrument apart just to get that one pad just right.
that one instrument could change their whole life.
came from the old <i>Frankenstein</i> movie...
...where Frankenstein was out in the woods,
And he was in the woods trying to run away.
That always stuck with me because growing up, got picked on so much.
I don't know what they thought, really. I was kinda in my own world.
Yeah.
[inhales] Yeah.
So, when I saw that spot in the movie
where the old blind gentleman who lived out in the woods,
And Frankenstein hears it,
and he follows it.
I'm goin', "Wow. The bow is going across the strings,
That was such an impression on me.
And then years go by, and I was at a swap meet.
And I saw a violin sitting there that somebody was selling.
I looked at it, and he said he wanted $20 for it.
I think I only had five dollars.
So I hitchhiked all the way back home.
Then my mom, I begged her.
Went back there. Ran down the aisle.
Went around the other aisle, and there it was.
Beautiful, like, lime-green felt on the inside.
And from that moment on, I had the fiddle bug.
In high school, I took every music class I could.
All the other classes were just complete torture.
Fiddle and the banjo.
Bam. We named ourselves after Bodie Ghost Town.
The Bodie Mountain Express.
So we came in a music store. We say we're a band.
We're looking for a place to play. Get some tips.
"Oh, you guys play?
Hey, get out your instruments and play some."
We had these silly hillbilly band routines.
The banjo player, you know, did the funny thing with his eyes.
And out comes this guy.
Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's manager.
And of course, Colonel Parker is friends with Liberace, Frank Sinatra.
Next thing you know, we're gonna go to Frank's house,
and we're gonna play a little concert for him.
We're gonna go to Liberace's house and play a little concert.
{\an8}...at Pontiac Dome Stadium. The Colonel put us on the Elvis show.
[performer] <i>Gonna feature Mr. Duane Michaels.</i>
We're all wearing overalls and...
and everybody waiting to see Elvis, looking like, "Who are these hillbillies?"
A few years after that, they hired us to play at Knott's Berry Farm.
and just hired us on the spot.
"The only thing is, we need you in Florida at Disney World."
"Sure!"
The Colonel, we had a close relationship.
That $20 fiddle I found at a swap meet has taken me all over the world.
<i>By the way, we're the Bodie Mountain Express.</i>
[Duane] And that brings us to where I'm at now.
The fact that the kids have a chance to play instruments if they can't afford it.
...could change their whole life.
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" on the piano.
I'm getting emotional.
I've just been playing for a while. Playing for a long time.
Mental health is something that's, like, very hard to manage sometimes.
Especially with everything that's going on in your life,
like school and thinking of what you want to be.
Like, I'm scared, like, I won't, like, find a purpose in life.
When you play onstage, you have, like, this overwhelming presence,
and, like, you know, the audience is, like, somewhat, like,
And you feel... a certain power.
Something like that. [giggles]
[supervisor] Pianos.
interesting here.
As supervisor, I have to make sure
that all instruments are repaired in a timely manner.
That shop is all up to the safety and all the employees are happy,
because we are a family here.
I'm a supervisor here...
I always remember the first time I saw a piano.
I was a little Armenian boy and living in Baku City
of former Soviet Union, Republic of Azerbaijan.
And I was sitting at the first row.
And he had to do every single one.
So many parts. How does he do that?
Wow."
he bought a guitar.
And he told me not to touch it.
And he comes home. "Who touched my guitar? I told you not to touch it."
I said, "Well, I just played a little bit."
My brother realized that I wasn't just, uh, touching a guitar,
And he gave me the guitar.
Uh, it was 1987,
They start kicking all the Armenians out.
Day by day, it was becoming difficult.
We would gather together outside of our buildings on the streets,
But day by day, there's less and less and less people with us,
because people are moving out.
They're afraid to stay.
My dad was optimistic because, "Steve, I'm not moving anywhere.
I never harmed anybody. I never did anything bad to anybody.
Our government will never let anything like that to happen."
That he didn't listen.
He was at work, and somebody just came from behind and killed him.
[whispers] Sorry.
Samson.
That's my son's name.
So, we just pretty much locked the doors.
The guitar.
It wasn't easy even to get to airport because we still look like Armenian.
And on the street, people can stop you and harm you.
So thanks to my friends, Azerbaijani friends,
they took us to airport.
{\an8}And, uh, they basically created a human corridor
in airport so we can go through it.
When we arrived in United States, they found a sponsor, Ken and Veronica.
and show it to Ken.
he tried to tell me through dictionary, but he couldn't find the right words.
But he had this picture,
beautiful painting, on his wall above his piano.
{\an8}The artist is Norman Rockwell.
So, he pointed at that picture.
at the school in the classroom.
And I went, "Oh, God. Is it possible that he tunes pianos?"
And we started laughing,
and he says, "Would you like to help me around the piano shop?"
"You're starting tomorrow.
I said, "Pfft, yes."
Then of course, Ken would send me to Yamaha schools,
to Baldwin schools, to Steinway school.
After what happened in the past, I lost the urge to follow the music,
to be in the music, to stay with the music.
But life brought me back to it.
Ended up being a piano tuner.
I mean, see how life is?
I love the violin.
[Dana] I think a lot of people see a broken thing,
Could be anything.
Maybe it's public schools.
[Dana] But when we see a broken thing,
we think, "Oh, with a little something here, a little something there,
[Paty] It's difficult work.
But no matter what...
It is one of the best things that humans do.
That's why this is not just a musical instrument repair shop.
When an instrument breaks, there's a student without an instrument.
No, no, no. Not in our city.
Even if they don't know me...
I'm part of that.
I've been dreaming about this day forever,
Look, I wanted to show you the church
Oh, Zhenya it's so beautiful.
I bet you wore the most beautiful dress at your own wedding.
I didn't have a wedding.
Sonya, can you please stay still?
I need to fix this piece.
Oh, oh, oh Vit, no.
What are you doing? You know it's bad luck.
How much longer will you be? Hi.
- Okay, enough. - [ceramic shatters]
Zhenya, what happened?
Come on, don't be silly.
Believe me, he'll love you more than before.
You should just tell him you didn't see anything.
You can't force him to stay.
Forget about him, Evgenia.
Get him out of your head.
Here.
Unless you cast a love spell, of course.
[Zhenya] <i>Hello Elena, is Kir home?</i>
What's happened?
He promised to stop by and pick it up,
That's odd.
Just there please.
What are you doing?
[Zhenya] I thought you'd come get your things.
Didn't have time
We need to talk.
if that's what you need for your life and your creativity.
We can handle it, right?
Of course there's an us.
There's you, there's me, and Polina.
Get outta here.
Oh, come in, dear.
Help me out. Go on.
Don't be scared.
You love him?
That's what really matters.
Do you have a friend getting married soon?
[Lola] You have to find one.
One whose love is very strong.
Trust me, you don't want to trick them.
Throw the salt in four directions.
You have to learn it by heart.
It's easier to reach the spirits there.
if you lied to me and your love is fake,
the spirits won't forgive you.
If he loves you, he'll come back.
Cast it until the meat's spoiled.
You'll be bound by blood.
Unless you change your mind.

- Hi. - Oleg, you shouldn't be here.
[priest] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
to witness the union of Viktor and Sophia in holy matrimony.
Marriage is sacred.
No one should enter into it hastily.
Dear Lord, our most merciful Father.
[whispering] I place my soul into this first candle.
Beloved son, Viktor, and Sophia,
is your wish today to be joined in holy matrimony
- Yes. - Yes.
Kirill's soul is placed in the second.
Make him stay with me forever.
Make him think of me.
Make him love me.
Do you promise to be true to each other
[both] Yes.
[Zhenya] The first candle yours.
The second candle mine.
You are mine and I am yours.
<i>You are mine and I am yours.</i>
You are mine and I am yours.
Both in sickness and in health?
[both] Yes.
You are mine and I am yours.
and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.
What?
It's okay.
It's just nerves.
Zhenya!
This is very bad luck
Zhenya, can you hear me?
You're gonna breathe by yourself now.
There we go.
You had an acute infection.
Would you like to call someone?
She's with my mom.
I just need to go home.
Tomorrow. You need some rest until then.
Viktor, I'm so, so sorry.
I don't know how it happened.
I'm begging you, Viktor.
What are you doing here?
You were in my dream.
Calling me. It was strange. I...
spent the rest of the day thinking about you.
I do.
You scared me.
You're so beautiful.
Like a bride.
The light on you.
Stand there.
Hi, Mom.
Don't worry, we'll be there soon.
Let's go get Polina?
I'll board it up now and put in a new one later.
I wouldn't wanna bother, sweetheart.
You've got your own family.
But you're also a part of the family,
[Mom] Well, maybe for a few days.
Uh, could you tell me, Kirill...
You'd be bothering us.
What?
I said, you'd be bothering us.
Mom, taxi's already here.
Go get ready.
What about the garden, dear?
Who'll take care of my garden?
Maybe you and Polina can stay here
just as a change of scenery to relax.
[Zhenya] But there are some things to do at home.
We'd love to spend some time together.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
I've got work today.
I don't understand.
It's all much more perfect in real life.
Kirill, I need to get going.
You don't have to work anymore.
We'll be together always.
Do you understand?
Just you and me.
Shh, easy, babe, you can't move.
She's asleep.
Just like you wanted.
I've only worn it once.
Sonya, what's the matter?
Nothing's wrong. Take your dress.
Wait, is there a problem?
- Maybe I can help you. - You already did.
He broke up with me on my wedding day.
Sonya.
Why the hell did you show up at our wedding?
Hello.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
because he used it to pay for the dress.
So, are we doing the refund?
Yeah, yeah.
Kir, I'm home.
Polina, sweetie.
There, there, it's okay.
Kirill, are you out of your mind?
Was she here all alone?
Baby, come on.
Nothing happened.
I was busy.
You said you'd be back soon.
I thought something changed when you came back.
I thought you really loved us.
Stay with me.
I'm yours, but I'm not your property.
I can't live like this.
You're my wife. You must.
I'm not your wife.
Please, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I... I just...
There, there, forgive me.
[Kirill] <i>Okay, then, sorry.</i>
[Viktor] Good afternoon.
- Hello. - [Viktor] So, what's going on with my card?
[Viktor] Mm. You can keep the dress.
[woman] But your bride asked us...
[Viktor] She's not my bride.
I'll leave the money for her.
This will be the refund.
As you wish.
Hello.
I'm fine, thank you.
Sorry, I guess it's none of my business.
You know, I feel very guilty for what I did to you.
it doesn't really matter anymore.
Did you also make this?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Zhenya, what's wrong?
Where does it hurt?
- Who the hell are you? - [Zhenya] Enough.
I said stop!
He's a doctor.
I felt sick and he was taking me home.
Are you done?
Yes.
I saw you two together and I just lost it.
Let me take you there.
[Zhenya] Where are we going, Kirill?
Can you hear me?
Why are you bringing me here?
And so I took you to my mom's.
Are you kidding? She hates me.
Well...
our relationship's been tense lately.
It's my fault, but we...
We're learning from our mistakes,
but there's one mistake that I'd like to correct right now.
What's going on?
Zhenya,
but you're going to be my wife.
Kirill.
I... I need to think about it.
[chuckles] Of course.
I'm so stupid. Mom, give me the ring.
Nobody here is interested in your opinion.
Mom, give me the damn ring right now!
This damn ring, as you call it, is an heirloom.
This ring will be given to someone who's worthy
with my blessing.
Where are you going so fast?
To see your daughter?
She's with my mom.
Where is she?
What did you do to her?
It's just that you're mine
No, this is not what I wanted.
All I wanted was for you to love me, but I made a mistake.
What mistake, baby?
I really do love you.
I cast a spell.
Hear me?
Shh, come here, silly thing.
It's simple.
Baby, you're awake,
but you can't get up just yet.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Baby.
- You break up with your man? - Yes.
I did.
What the hell are you doing?
[Viktor] Morning, Zhenya.
I bought some diapers and formula for your daughter.
I hope I chose the right ones.
- You probably thought... - No, Zhenya, I didn't.
Here's the deal, you have breakfast and get some rest.
Then I'll come back and we'll figure something out.
- Deal? - Deal.
Great.
Hello.
Vit, I know you'll never believe me,
but can you please, please hear me out?
Vit.
The lift's at capacity, Vik.
Sorry, Sonya, no room.
Vit, I won't leave until we talk.
Do you hear me?
My ex is the same.
Running around like a hyena.
Who you have here?
Zhenya, what's the matter?
[Zhenya] Kir was here.
I don't know how he found us.
Zhenya, Kirill's dead.
- [Kol] You ready? - Yes.
It's all my fault.
I just couldn't let you go.
Help me! [panting]
[Viktor] Listen, sometimes when you're stressed out,
I need to go now.
Okay, you need to stay here.
Hey.
I see you're here a lot, Zhenya.
And you don't look like you're grieving much.
Maybe better that she go?
She's right. I have to go.
Thanks for the help.
Just don't expect him to marry you now.
Marriage is something that sticks with you, right, Vit?
Her husband died today.
[Zhenya] <i>Mom, how is Polina?</i>
Yeah.
Thanks, love you, too.
but I cast a spell.
<i>You and Sonya seemed like the perfect couple.</i>
<i>Everything was supposed to work out.</i>
But our feelings weren't true, that's why it went wrong.
It turned out to be a nightmare.
He feeds on pure love, but he was tricked.
You see? Your love wasn't true.
I want to fix this.
There must be a way, right?
Some mistakes can only be fixed in death.
Coming was a mistake.
I don't know how to fix this, myself, but, you can ask.
Are you always like this, doctor?
Why did you marry that girl?
Then why are you here?
Enter when the time comes.
Close your eyes.
No sudden movements.
[Lola] Master are you here?
[low male voice] I'm here, come.
Why are you hunting this woman?
What do you need from her?
Her soul.
She promised it to me.
The first candle my soul.
The second...
Do you understand what you did?
You came to someone's wedding, you ruined it.
Kirill died because of you.
I don't wanna be involved in this.
I'm sorry.
Oleg, why are you here?
Go away.
Sonya, you don't love him.
- We need to talk. - Oleg, please don't.
This is nonsense.
Give us a minute.
Please.
[woman] <i>You can't reverse the spell.</i>
<i>Your marriage is blessed by the Devil.</i>
My daughter is reckless.
She has made many mistakes
and owes the spirits a great debt.
She thought she could pay them off with pure love,
but she failed.
<i>but even he can be tricked.</i>
You know, I thought that if we got married
it would have been the right thing.
To settle down, have a family, like it's usually done,
You never loved me either.
I guess...
we were caught in this untrue love.
Not the wedding,
not a spell.
[woman] If love wasn't true,
but they all have to come of their own free will.
[Sonya] I won't help her.
In some way we're also guilty.
I think it's the time to fix it all, everything.
You know what, you fix it.
You do it.
Thank you, Oleg.
You okay?
Has everyone come here by their own free will?
The ceremony will be performed only
The spirits don't like to be tricked.
The liar shall pay for their mistake.
The first candle, release my soul.
Where is the girl?
Zhenya, what do we do?
- Mom? - Your daughter's missing.
She's not answering.
They're not here.
I know where they are.
Hold on.
Mom, Mom, we're going to get you out of here.
I'll help her. Go look for your daughter.
Hold on. It's going to hurt.
Mom?
Stop it!
You are mine and I am yours.
Take my soul.
Everything's going to be okay.
Mom.
No, he wasn't.
He "wohuo" every day.
What does "wohuo" mean?
It means he complained every day.

It's just a pack of jerky,
not a local specialty.

I'll be right back.
Okay.
Sir,
can I speak first later?
Why?
You're in a hurry?
There are many professors before you.
How about this?
A, B, C, D...
It's fair.
C...
Fine.
Alright, thanks.
(Meeting on reservoir development and immigration work)
Quiet please.
The meeting is starting.
You.
Mr. Ai.
You speak first.
Thank you, Dean,
Thanks.
Many are coming to the hotpot tonight.
There are...
15 people in total.
15 people.
Ask Professor Chen to come too.
Forget about him.
It's a universal problem
You understand?
Yes.
Slowly, we'll get rich.
among all our tasks.
Comrades.
Thank you all.
The focus of my research is
behind the reservoir.
We're all experts.
Please.
I'm off. Thanks.
Professor Chen.
Quiet, quiet.
Next,
Professor Bi.
Your turn.
Okay.
Dean, Dean.
Look.
Why did he draw this?
This is someone's sand table.
You peed on it.
It took them three years
to build this.
Naughty you.
Associate Professor Chen.
He'll be a professor soon.
If he had listened to me,
he would be a professor now.
I bet he won't agree to it.
That's it.
Six tong.
Win!
Give me the money.
You're so lucky.
Let's call it a day.
As soon as you won?
The professor is coming home.
What should we do?
Come.
You're against your own.
Go over.
Sit over there.
I'll play then.
Not upright.
Then?
Tilt it a little.
Okay.
Watch your hands.
(Authentic spicy stock)
Professor Chen.
The same? One fifth without chilies?
Yes.
Professor Chen, shall I put chilies in it too?
No, don't.
It's been years.
It's better to keep it bland.
Okay.
See you, Professor Chen.
Okay.
Dad is home.
Go meet him.
Here I am.
Dad.
You're home.
Take this.
You're home.
It smells so nice.
Tell him straight.
He's not unreasonable.
Okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
Wait for me.
There are four people eating.
Don't just get yours.
Dad, let me.
Go get the chopsticks.
Water.
I usually drink this.
You stay here.
Okay.
Good.
Stay in there.
Don't come out.
Don't come down.
Put more in.
He doesn't eat fish mint anyway.
Dad.
Well...
I've got a job.
Finally had enough time off?
I can work from home for now.
I want to give it a try.
If it goes well,
I'll go to Beijing.
The package they offer...
What's that noise?
Is pretty good.
Two meals are included too.
Good, well done.
Our son's made us proud!
Why are you downstairs?
Dad.
Dad.
I...
Mom.
Mom.
Dogs aren't allowed at home.
What's that?
You know it well.
Are you trying to piss me off?
What does "gui mi ri yan" mean?
Unreasonable.
She says you're weird.
I picked it up on my research trip.
All the residents had left.
No one was there.
It's pitiful
and I'm not?
What does "zao nie" mean?
It means pitiful.
Yes, you're pitiful.
You're pitiful.
You're more pitiful than it.
Stop pretending you can't understand the dialect.
It's okay. It's okay.
Send it away at once.
As soon as I find it a good owner,
I promise that you won't feel pitiful.
It's all your fault.
A bottle of soy sauce, please.
You sell dogs too?
The dog with the box was just adopted.
I see.
A tube of toothpaste, please.
Colgate?
Colgate.
- How much? - Three yuan.
Thanks.
Let's go.
It'll bite you.
I want... I want a doggy.
No, no, it bites.
It bites?
Yes, it bites.
(Seeking adoption)
Goddess of Mercy.
So annoying.
Another goal!
Xinqiao, it's 9-1.
That's right. Really.
Right,
They scored, so you get a reward.
Come on.
Let's be good.
Be quiet tonight.
Look at this.
You like it?
A puppy eating a bear cub.
My goodness!
You're tearing it apart.
because you're still growing.
You still have the cheek to ask?
You hid it from me.
Why not?
In front of so many people,
you're not embarrassed but I'd feel ashamed.
Enough, don't interfere in my business.
Your business?
You're still an associate professor.
Is that all you can say?
You can't say anything useful.
I told you.
Shy kids get no sweets.
What's the use of just being good?
I'm getting old.
Turn the light off.
Is she bringing him home tomorrow?
You're in trouble, you know?
Luckily, it's me who came up.
Be good. Stay here.
You hid a tile in here.
You like this?
It's called "batong".
Don't worry.
3, 2, 1, say cheese!
Okay.
Let me see.
Taking photos, developing them, scanning them.
I know don't what you're up to.
Just put out the flyer.
It's just a mongrel.
Why are we doing a whole photo shoot?
If you put out more flyers,
more people will see it too.
Professor Chen.
Look at these.
Seeking a son-in-law with great wealth.
De-worming wine.
Look, what are these?
A mongrel dog. Male.
Three-month-old. Very lively and obedient.
Batiao.
I don't want batiao.
Santiao.
I don't want santiao.
Santiao for me too.
Why are you still drawing?
Discard it already.
Where is the puppy?
I still have santiao.
Where is the puppy?
It got adopted.
Peng.
By whom?
Someone fat.
Man? Woman? Old? Young?
What's the family like?
Where do they live?
I don't know.
Great!
How would I know I need to question them for a dog?
Where did they go?
To the market.
Mister, fresh meat!
The puppy of yours...
how would you like it?
Pepper dog meat.
With what?
Radish.
Salty or light?
Salty!
50 yuan.
I know.
Wait, let me cut this meat.
Okay.
Xinqiao, turn the tap on.
Let's have a bath.
How nice it feels.
You never had a bath, eh?
Let's wash your little paws.
Be good.
Let's have a look.
See, how pretty!
So energetic.
Now you're clean.
Look at your beautiful fur.
Right?
Yeah?
Depending on how active it is,
(Engineering Geology Study of Active Faults)
It...
Excuse me.
He wants to take the dog to the construction site.
No.
Absolutely no.
Male.
Are you married?
Yes. Can't I ask?
So strict.
Married?
Jiazhen, are you done? We're waiting.
We're all waiting for you.
Sit.
And the usable floor area?
Usable floor area...
He didn't specify.
No.
Professor Chen.
(China Communications Services)
Why didn't I see you this morning?
I kept the morning paper for you.
Thanks.
(Convenience Kiosk)
Here.
Thank you, Uncle.
Which district in Chongqing?
Chengkou.
Where?
Chengkou.
Chengkou near Hubei?
Broadly speaking,
it's part of Chongqing.
Yes, part of Chongqing.
It's April.
It's not very hot.
You're sweating a lot.
Are you unable to withstand heat?
No.
He's terrified of you.
Someone's terrified of me?
What do you do for a living?
His last job got him nowhere,
Were you born with such brown hair
I dyed it.
Young man.
I think you should treat your hair seriously
because it directly reflects
Dad.
I like him.
No.
Absolutely not.
You're not qualified.
Yes, stop.
You goddam dog!
I was winning!
So annoying!
Tell me.
When will you send it away?
When you win a game, I have to hear about it all day.
No matter what, we should
More than ten people call every day.
and you're saying they're unsuitable.
there's no guarantee you'll win the game,
right?
You have a kind heart.
Surely you can't bear to hand him
to someone unreliable, can you?
Chen Jingxiu.
You're being very unreasonable.
and you fed it to the dog.
How could you?!
No wonder you're still an associate professor.
You can't tell the dean from the dog!
Why do you mention the dean?
They aren't the same species.
Besides,
Batong?
Yes, Batong.
Tell you what.
Get along well? Get along your ass!
Don't mind my dad.
My dad is so hen-pecked.
Li Jiazhen.
You play it all day long.
Do you need my approval?
Because you like it.
Your fingers are glued to the keyboard.
Look at your hair.
As soon as you wake up, you sit there.
You never go out.
You're about to be sucked into the computer.
Do you need my approval?
No, you don't either.
Why not?
Because you like it.
And you.
The guy you like.
That guy
from Chengkou.
We human beings
live for
no more than several decades.
So,
because you like these things.
Today,
No one can stop me.
Xiaozhou, come here.
And you too.
He's your younger brother.
You make me so furious!
Hiding behind a dog, eh?
(1 year later)
Okay, ready.
Get closer. Closer.
You're family.
Ma'am, smile.
It's a family photo.
1, 2, 3.
Another.
Relax.
Ma'am, smile.
1, 2, 3, good!
Congratulations!
Thank you, thanks.
Mind the steps.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
You've got such a good son-in-law. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Please sit.
Off you go.
Jiazhen.
It's from Ruixia and Guo.
We've got spicy chicken.
Pork with red bean.
Alright, get the lighter dishes ready.
Ma'am.
Where would you like the firecrackers?
Up there.
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
Spicy chicken.
Another spicy dish.
This isn't spicy. Try it.
It's not spicy.
Not spicy.
You know what?
One - it's not spicy.
And the other?
The other is...
My wife always listens to me.
Chen Jingxiu.
Chen Jingxiu.
Keep him in the house.
Yes.
Batong, let's go.
Let's go inside, Batong.
Okay.
Upstairs, go.
Come here.
so they can cope with hard times.
Am I right?
Batong.
They've built so many tall buildings.
In a few years,
They'll build tall buildings on this side too.
By then, when we look over there,
You want one too?
Yes?
Good.
Let's have one.
Good?
Professor Chen.
I've told you countless times.
Put your dirty clothes in the basket.
Come, Batong.
So obedient.
More obedient than you.
More obedient than you.
Batong.
Come, sit.
Good boy.
Batong.
Baby, sit.
Be good.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Let me check the ticket. Okay.
I'm sorry.
Let's go. Go home.
You can't come here. Go.
You chased after Daddy.
You can't go to work with Daddy.
Got it?
Look, he brought a dog in.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You can't go in there.
Professor Chen, is that your dog?
I found it in Yunyang.
(Mineral water, instant noodles)
Your fellow villager!
Shut up.
Go home.
Alright.
Go home.
Come here.
Here.
Give this
to Li Jiazhen.
It's great.
Easy.
Batong.
Peng.
I'm calling for the Batong in your house.
Let's pause.
Come here.
Put it here.
In my house,
you have to follow my rules.
Got it?
Thanks.
See you soon.
Professor Chen, you're back.
Batong,
my silly son.
He got here just now.
What?
He came only a moment ago.
Kept staring at the station.
Let's go.
Go home.
You wanna read it too?
Yes?
1000 g of chicken breast.
And?
120 g each.
Chen Jingxiu.
You idiot.
What experiment are you doing?
What a mess!
Cook us dinner if you're so capable.
Mom, please help him.
That's for Batong.
It's taken him ages.
In his dreams!
I feed you two beasts every day.
Now I have to feed his dog too?
It's okay for your mom
to cook for people.
As long as all the ingredients are fresh.
Oh, yeah?
I've got the fighting spirit.
No problem.
Fighting spirit.
It's time.
Hm, smells nice.
Cool it down.
Okay, it's cooled.
Here.
Yummy?
If it's yummy, have some more.
Come on.
Why did you stop eating?
Eat.
Come on, eat.
It should taste okay.
It's not that bad.
If you don't stop him from eating,
it'll upset his tummy again.
See what a mess he'll make!
(Email)
Go enjoy the sun.
You'll go blind.
I got an email from Beijing.
Yes.
I'm going to Beijing.
Batong.
Batong.
You have an upset tummy. Stop biting it.
Can't the collar stop you?
Batong.
I give up.
Batong.
Come.
You love your mom's meat balls.
Traitor.
You lost the mahjong game?
We were even.
Didn't I tell you?
The way
you play the game...
You have a fifty-fifty chance
of winning.
It's like flipping a coin.
The more times you throw,
It's half and half.
If you continue playing like this,
who is the winner?
You're talking nonsense.
Xinqiao has something to tell you.
Here.
Which company?
State-owned or private?
The friends I mentioned last year.
It's in Beijing.
How does a web design company make money?
So cold in winter.
You're not used to the food there.
Can you adjust to it?
Where will you stay?
Dad.
we have no family in Beijing.
I've booked the train ticket for tomorrow morning.
I'm full.
Give him some advice.
When you should speak,
you say nothing.
He's bought the train ticket.
What's the point of me saying anything?
Batong, let's go.
Let's take a stroll.
Come.
So, he loves his dog more than me.
Eat.
Just do your best.
I thought you'd left when it started raining.
Yes or no? I'm in a hurry. It's raining.
Okay.
I'll give you a 10% discount.
Hurry up.
It's raining.
(Authentic spicy marinade)
One fifth with no chilies?
No, all with chilies.
What is he doing?
He's chasing the light.
We always head towards light.
So funny.
Come, take the pills.
The pills will make me too sleepy
Just take them.
Good.
Your mom is treating you so well
that you're allowed on the bed.
So annoying.
Off you go.
Batong.
It's eight.
(For hire)
Excuse me, can my dog get in?
Yes.
Get in.
Mister, it's urgent.
I'll get off here.
Batong, this way.
Attention, passengers.
will soon depart.
Passengers for this train
please board now.
Other guests, please stand behind the white security line.
Batong.
Batong!
Batong!
Batong!
(Half a year later)
Batong, bring it to Li Jiazhen.
Chen Jingxiu, did you forget something?
Look.
What's he doing?
What's happening in the world?
Shh. She's quite pretty.
Batong takes after me.
(Ice jelly, cold shrimp)
You can't be good for nothing.
Two bowls of cold shrimp.
(Ice jelly, cold shrimp)
What's this?
It's celtuce.
This is green pepper.
it's very spicy.

Time to eat.
Where is Batong?
I didn't see him.
Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Come here.
My good boy.
It's closed today.
Daddy forgot you today.
I'm sorry.
Come, let's go home.
Slow down.
Goal!
Batong.
It's a goal!
Keep calm. Now it's down to our goalie.
Batong.
We won!
We're in the finals, you know?
Go! Go! Go!
When will the power be restored?
It's so hot in Chongqing.
How can you bear it?
I forgot to tell you.
There is power rationing today.
No power for a day in this district.
Your Chongqing...
Chongqing offers you food, a place to live and sunshine.
What more do you want?
Calm down and you'll feel cool.
I won!
What the hell!
Not again!
Give me the money.
Batong.
It's cool now, isn't it?
Here.
Here.
Let's do it together.
Let's bury it.
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
You can't find it anymore.
It's gone.
Come, let's sit here.
Sit.
Good, let's take a photo.
Don't look at me,
look that way.
Look.
It's convenient
and he loves it too.
Yes.
I don't have to cook for the dog anymore.
No need to cook for people either.
Don't wind yourself up again.
Now, it's just us.
Two slices left.
Finish it.
I really can't eat anymore.
How about this?
Leave it in the fridge.
When I come back from my research trip,
put it in the noodles for me.
So annoying.
I'm off.
Batong, stay home.
I won't come home tonight.
Don't let him go to the station.
Yes.
Bye bye, Batong.
Go home.
the water reached 175m high.
the places you're seeing now, by then.
Where is Professor Chen?
I'm off.
Okay.
Don't go home for now.
Yeah.
Okay.
But nobody took photos of him.
Batong.
Where is Batong?
Batong.
Still waiting?
That day...
He came to see me off at the station, right?
I knew.
I knew.
Look.
Do you like
this color?
(Demolition Notice)
Don't worry. There is enough room.
I rented a bigger place.
There is an elevator, you can move easily.
Okay?
How about Batong?
I'll ask again
but I don't think so.
Ming.
Batong.
Batong, come.
He's had breakfast.
Okay.
We're off.
Bye, Mom.
(6 months later)
What is he looking at?
I'll go get breakfast.
What?
Batong.
What are you looking at?
Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Go, now!
Leave, quick.
We came here earlier today.
Let's check again.
He's incredible.
Batong.
Let's go home.
Go home.
Batong.
Let's go home.
Go home.
Go, Batong.

Let's go home.
Come on, go home.
Go home.
Good boy.
Go home.
Quick.
Take this.
Okay.
Come on, Batong.
Batong.
Batong.
Don't tie him too tightly. He's very obedient.
No problem.
Okay, don't worry.
You can run around in the countryside.
I'm sure you'll like it.
Be good.
Batong.
He's not coming back tonight.
Go home now.
Okay, Batong.
Go home.
Batong, be good.
What?
What are you doing?
Go away!
Go away!
Wait.
(Roasted Taiwan sausage)
We fellow villagers have to look after each other.
I don't get much work here either.
Go home and start a restaurant
I'm off.
The Yangtze River Ropeway you see here
It's stayed here since then.
For ten years.
It waits here every day.
Wait a minute.
Your house isn't completely torn down.
Let it show you.
Not completely torn down?
Mom.
Let's go have a look.
Yifan.
Wait here with Chuanchuan.

{\an8}<i>Slow down.</i>
{\an8}<i>So,</i>
{\an8}<i>we've decided</i>
{\an8}<i>to take</i>
{\an8}<i>Forget it.</i>
{\an8}<i>Have a nice life, everyone.</i>
What a temper.
Okay.
Be careful, slow down.
This…
This is for you.
How can you let this happen?
How can you blame me?
XIAMEN YIFU HIGH SCHOOL
I think you shouldn’t worry too much.
<i>I've decided that Xiamen University is my first choice.</i>
What did you fill out?
-Mine is Xiamen University of Technology. -That's great.
Just go on.
Zheng Yuxing from Class 4 skipped the exam.
Zheng Yuxing?
Zheng Yuxing is so handsome.
Many girls are pursuing him.
-I heard -I have no idea.
-Yes, I heard about that too. -Yes.
There were rumors in school that he was dating.
Apparently, he'd disappear every weekend.
It's like a Korean drama.
He was in a bad mood, so he left for the airport.
<i>Great, we have to stay here another year.</i>
What can we do when our child is sick?
Sick?
Did you ask her why?
True, you look too fierce.
Nobody wants to confide in you.
Fine.
{\an8}Chen Chen.
It's too sunny here. Come inside.
Come on.
No reason.
She's not telling you either.
Bring the rice cooker box in for me.
Listen, Chen Chen.
I even quit my job.
You're a big girl now.
I'm giving her pressure?
Is it me then?
If you didn't, would she have gone out in the rain?
I'm not as pushy as you, okay?
-Who's pushy? How am I pushy? -You're so pushy
that we can hardly breathe.
I'm the one being pushed by you two!
I got dumped.
That was why I ran out in the rain.
And I bombed my exam.
I have.
How…
Look at you. You weren't even aware that your daughter was dating.
When did that happen?
Yes.
Go and buy me some water.
Wait.
What?
Who was it? Who was your boyfriend?
A classmate.
We broke up.
We broke up already. You…
-Why do you always check people's phones? -You don't know the pin.
Isn't it your dad's birthday?
I'll check it myself.
Zheng Yuxing.
What's his name?
I think…
Let's stop contacting each other.
-You're going to miss your flight. -Hey.
If you have concerns,
I can wait.
It's just another year at most.
{\an8}Just go.
{\an8}-You'll be late. -If you don't tell me clearly,
{\an8}how can I leave in peace?
{\an8}Stop joking around.
{\an8}I'm deleting it now.
{\an8}You…
Okay.
Fine. I'll go.
I'm going.
Let's go.
I've reviewed her grades as well.
She did well in the first three subjects.
Only in the last subject, English,
did she fail.
-Correct. -It was obviously due to her health.
Well, the school is still taking her seriously this year.
As long as she performs on par next year,
Then, let's…
Ms. Qu.
Actually, there was another reason why Chen Chen did poorly last year.
-Stand up. -Hey, the teacher is here.
Sit down.
Today, we will do the 2018 exam questions.
I'll also take the time to tell you something.
Chen Chen.
Please stand up.
Zheng Yuxing.
Stand up too.
Yuxing?
Come on.
You know why I called you two?
Let me formally introduce you to everybody.
from our school last year.
Star-crossed lovers.
-What? -You dare to say "What"?
Look at Chen Chen.
Chen Chen, on the left,
was a top student from last year's class.
She thought… Stand properly.
And what happened?
She fell seriously ill and bombed the exam.
Zheng Yuxing, on the right, is even more of a character.
The image of a young, rebellious rule-breaker.
Wang Mingkun.
Swap seats with Chen Chen.
you two are not moving.
Hey. What's going on?
No, I…
I wanted to ask her.
About what?
-No, Ms. Qu. Today, we-- -There is no "we."
-"There is no 'we.'" -Quiet.
Chen Chen has the right attitude now.
Do well in the exam next year.
If you want to date in college,
Sit down.
and try to get into the same college as her.
Otherwise, even if you don't break up now,
you will sooner or later.
All right. The rest of you, please learn from this.
Class dismissed. Stand up.
Okay, sit down.
Finish the questions.
-Okay, miss. -We still have to continue?
Chen Chen, right?
Can we…
How awkward.
-Go after her! -Go after her!
-May I sit here? -Yes.
Don't misunderstand.
Hey, don't be so pathetic.
Why are you avoiding me?
Chen Chen, go in first.
Hey. You…
Dismissal is in five minutes.
You're leaving now?
Bye.
Hey.
What's wrong with following my girlfriend?
Who's your girlfriend?
Exactly. Who is my girlfriend?
Tell me.
Why did you lie?
Really?
I guessed right? I really guessed right?
That was actually what happened?
This was what happened.
Who knew that you'd be back to repeat the grade?
I apologize, okay?
All right. Don't worry, bye.
Wait.
I have another question.
Out of all the guys in school, why me?
Don't go.
Don't be shy.
Even if our past was a lie,
-What's your problem? -No…
Didn't you tell me that you two broke up?
Then why did the teacher tell me
that several people spotted you two meeting in secret?
No.
Yes, we did meet.
-That was it. -Did you delete his WeChat?
I did.
Look, his name is Zheng Yuxing.
“Add to contact”. Not a friend, see?
-I believe you. I-- -Take a look.
I believe you.
Bring me another bottle.
It has been ages since he last came.
Who knows? He's always so busy.
I miss him.
I'll send him a message tomorrow to ask.
Time to study.
You eat it.

-Do you want to play ball? -Let's play soccer.
Look, I'm so envious.
-What's the rush? -Go after her!
-Go for it! -Go after her!
-Go after her! -Go after her!
You're not running anymore?
<i>Announcement.</i>
<i>Senior 3 Class 10</i>
<i>Zheng Yuxing and Chen Chen.</i>
<i>Report to the teacher's office now.</i>
Just now in PE class, you kept running after Chen Chen.
Get back together?
No.
I…
-Ms. Qu, ask her too. She's right here. -I am asking you.
Don't shift the problem to others.
No, Ms. Qu.
-Actually, just now, he-- -Don't butt in.
Anyway, I didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything, right?
Then why did Chen Chen's mom suddenly call me?
No. Ms. Qu, it's really not what you think.
Then please tell me.
Tell me.
Speak.
Actually…
-I… -Actually, I'm still clinging to her.
It's my fault.
I…
I won't bother her anymore.
That's right.
That way, you'll only make her dislike you more, right?
Moreover, you aren't kids anymore, right?
Love is a two-way street, you know.
If you don't belong together, then leave each other alone.
You're a man.
Girls don't need dignity?
-That's not what I mean. Don't set me up. -Okay.
So stop bothering her.
Otherwise, you'll just appear childish.
Was I too harsh?
Can we talk?
About what?
Weren't you crying
just now?
Zheng Yuxing.
What?
Nothing.
Did you get dumped?
None of your business.
Actually,
I'm not in a good mood lately too.
How about this?
I'll tell you a secret,
Isn't that how coming-of-age movies go?
I hate coming-of-age movies.
Me too.
What's the secret?
The truth is…
I failed the exam
And then?
That's it.
Your turn.
Your secret.
You really got dumped?
I don't know if you can call it that.
We never made it official.
She was hard to deal with.
What is she like?
She's in Beijing,
DJ?
Someone that plays songs?
Take that back.
-Take it back. -Okay, I take it back.
I'm sorry.
Why so many questions?
A month before the exam.
She wouldn't answer my calls.
I felt so miserable back then.
She called me childish
I was so furious back then.
I thought, "You want me to take the exam?
Then I'll skip it."
I'm sorry.
Everything on my TikTok is for her.
You know what?
if she was one of them.
Was she?
Never.
But I think it's because she still likes me.
then liking my video wouldn't be such a big deal, right?
She never liked any of my videos
because she still…
I'm not.
I'm not.
No.
You wouldn't get it because you've never dated.
How do you know that I've never dated?
I just do.

-Hey. -I just want to talk to you.
Can you please stop calling me?
<i>Hey!</i>
Mom!
Why did you tell the teacher that Zheng Yuxing was bothering me?
Didn't I already tell you that's not true?
Why is that any of my business?
You think the exam only concerns you?
If that's the case,
What am I doing here every day?
I cook, and you go to school.
-I don't even have friends. You… -I didn't ask you to stay here.
-But I just insist on staying here. -No, that's not what I meant.
That's what you meant.
-Can you tone it down? -I can't!
You were dating.
I'm telling you, Chen Chen.
I'll leave right away.
-I will leave immediately. -Go!
I don't need you!
I'll leave tomorrow!
What are you looking at?
Tang Chufei…
What happened?
-What are you doing? -Zheng Yuxing, your ex is here.
I'm his current girlfriend.
Ms. Qu.
It created a buzz.
Almost everybody in the school knows.
So you're using me to provoke your mom?
But it's okay.
I don't mind.
-Come on. -Wait.
It appears frequently in every part.
Wait.
Hello.
I'm eating in the canteen.
Why don't I…
Zheng Yuxing.
Zheng Yuxing.
What?
Yes, what's the matter? Any problems?
"Listen, your daughter and I are together."
-No, I… -I can't say it.
It's simple, let me finish.
No, I…
-Is that so hard? -No way, I'm terrified of parents.
-I can't. It's spilling. -No, put it down.
Put it down.
-Can't you just do me a favor? -I can't.
Your mom's here.
-No, I can't do it. -Put it down first and sit down.
I'm Zheng Yuxing.
Why won't you sit here then?
Then why can't I sit here?
Why don't I
sit over there?
Zheng Yuxing.
I heard that you're an Internet celebrity.
No.
Not quite.
I just recorded some videos.
They somehow went viral.
What do Internet celebrities do?
So?
Internet celebrities--
Look, this is my understanding.
Is it kind of like
Yes, it is.
I started a band and was the main vocalist.
You are quite handsome.
But that won't work for more mature girls, handsome boy.
-Thank you, Mrs. Chen. -Why are you thanking her?
She said that I'm handsome.
-You didn't hear the first part-- -I'm not finished.
to tell you both the reason you didn't do well last year.
then you broke up.
Chen Chen in particular
Didn't you both come back to school
to get into a good college?
-You can't break up. -We won't--
You absolutely cannot break up this year.
This is so sour.
What were you doing?
Zheng Yuxing got into the top class with such bad grades.
He must be from a good family.
As a girl,
after going to a good college and finding a good job,
you still need to marry well.
Not necessarily.
When I was young, your grandparents were
adamantly against your dad and me being together
since he doesn't come from a good family.
And I ended up marrying him.
I wouldn't go that far.
So
Sweet, so sweet.
You two have been together since high school?
And you're each other's first love.
Despite all obstacles, you still stayed together until the end.
How nice.
That's why I've thought it through.
At least until the exam.
Zheng Yuxing's grades are so bad.
to end up together?
Come on.
Tell me what you're recording.
Hi, I want to make an announcement.
This is my girlfriend.
-Don't take it seriously. Is it off? -You…
It's off.
-What are you doing? -I know, I just…
You…
What?
They date.
You're using me?
How is it "using you"?
Or maybe,
so she'd think that you no longer care?
Yes.
Yes.
-Come on, let's do it. -Okay.
Yes, go.
Hi, let me introduce you.
I have an announcement today.
This is my girlfriend.
You…
Give a reaction.
Who behaves like this when dating?
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.
Give them…
What?
-This is better. -No.
Don't move.
Put it there.
Let me do it.
Relax.
Smile.
Smile.

This is my girlfriend.
A bigger smile. Come, one, two, three.
Okay, that's enough.

<i>Wasn't that silly?</i>
You think you're a celebrity?
You think I have nothing better to do?
The teacher was asking me about it.
What should I say?
Tell me. What's going on?
Well, he insisted on shooting that. I couldn't stop him.
Fine, we'll work hard to be low-key, okay?
-I'll study hard. -Come back.
-What? -Sit down.
I'm not finished yet.
Don't you feel awkward?
Your relationship should only concern the two of you.
Why let others know?
-Are you showing off? Are you? -Yes.
Why are you looking at my phone?
Hello?
I have some errands.
-Sit down, didn't you have more to say? -It's urgent.
None of your business, go study.
Wait. Later--
I had no other choice.
I called you and your phone was off.
You never called me, so many…
Zheng Yuxing.
Hello, Mrs. Chen.
Hello, Mr. Chen.
-Why are you here? -Hello.
I came to study with Chen Chen.
We've scheduled it.
This is Zheng Yuxing,
Chen Chen's boyfriend.
Didn't they break up?
How do you know we broke up?
To pick up Zheng Yuxing.
Who are you?
-Yes. -This is my daughter, Chen Chen.
We didn't break up.
Right?
Aren't you here to study with Chen Chen?
We'll get going.
I guess I'll go. No need to send me off.
Bye.
Though I traveled a long distance,
I'll send you off then.
-It was a long trip. -No need.
I'll send Uncle Wang off.
It's getting late.
Okay.
Mom, come back soon.
That was close.
-Your mom obviously likes him. -No way.
Why not?
Let's be together."
"This is a bit scandalous after all.
You shouldn't come to my house no matter what!"
Look. There's a hotel there."
He's obviously bothering my mom.
Okay.
Look.
Add me on WeChat."
"I'm sorry, don't break my family apart.
Thank you."
Look.
Let's see.
She scanned the code.
Look, she's telling him to go.
{\an8}They kissed!
{\an8}He forced himself on her.
This…
Your mom's smiling.
Forget it, I'm done.
Anyway, there's no way my mom likes him.
Fine.
You're not your mom, how would you know?
-Are you sure? -Of course. That…
You're not her, how do you know?
My parents have been together ever since school.
And they're each other's first love.
I think this is how love should be.
What?
Nothing.
No.
Do you think that since I've never dated, my opinion doesn't matter?
Come on.
<i>Actually, I didn't dare tell Chen Chen</i>
is that I have no other choice.
a type of faith
that keeps me going
If I stop believing it,
be meaningless?
Does that make sense?
<i>Regarding that,</i>
<i>I have no comment.</i>
Forget it.
<i>Okay, playing your personalized radio station.</i>
Louder.
Turn it all the way up.
I'm sure.
Hey.
I just wiped that.
You should know how you did.
Change your seats in three minutes. Go.
We will meet again.
Hurry.
Chen Chen.
Come back.
Sit down.
Didn't I tell you before? Yours and Zheng Yuxing's seats are fixed.
Go outside, hurry.
Ms. Qu, I have a question.
Well…
Why can't we choose our seats?
Chen Chen's mom said that we can be together.
Quiet.
I don't care what her mom said.
Go, there's nothing to see.
Out.
Wait, Ms. Qu.
I have another question.
What is Chen Chen's rank this time?
Everything's fine then.
Chen Chen's grades are steady.
It's clear that dating has no impact on our grades.
Everything's fine then.
I've always been last,
so my grades are steady too.
And I never said that dating can improve our grades.
on our grades.
Fine.
You stay where you are.
Chen Chen.
Choose your seat.
What are you listening to?
What?
Want to listen to it?
Put it back.
Keep listening, be patient.
Come in.
Wear these.
Where do we study?
What's the rush?
I'll show you around first.
Come.
That's my dad's room. This is mine.
What's this?
Mixers and turntables.
Of course. I'm very serious about it.
Why do you like electronic music?
Is it because of her?
Not entirely.
How about I give you a brief introduction to electronic music?
Electronic music is actually a very broad concept.
If you were to thoroughly categorize
all the various styles,
Eighty?
-You've listened to them all? -Yes.
-The more you listen to it, -Fine.
and what kind of music
can bring comfort to your various moods.
Then…
Sit over there.
I'll tell you about it.
There was even one song I love
that only had two comments.
That made me very curious.
Who are those two people?
That is electronic music.
but…
Then…
For you…
You…
-You-- -Forget it, let's go.
Let's study, Zheng Yuxing.
What?
Can you sing?
Everyone can sing.
I'm actually not bad.
Really?
Then come on.
Sing a song.
I'll accompany you.
Shouldn't we study?
You can really play whatever I sing?
"Heroes' Song."
What is "Heroes' Song"?
<i>Big river flowing to the east</i>
<i>The stars in the sky</i>
Sing another one.
I can't play that.
I can't play that. Pick a normal song.
-A normal one? -Yes.
Well…
How about Mayday's "Embrace"?
-Is that okay? -That's fine.
-Are you sure? -I'll get ready.
That's Europe's largest electronic music festival.
It does look pretty interesting.
Yes, we can go together some time.
I'm ready, come on.
Yes, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.
<i>Take…</i>
Wait.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.
-<i>Take off…</i> -I know.
Let's do "one, two, three."

Hello, Mr. Zheng.
Mr. Zheng, I'm Zheng Yuxing's classmate.
Let's go then.
Let's study.
Choose seats based on your rank.
Don't ask.
All right, everybody. Time's up.
What is that?
Your name.
It's my stage name.
the initials for Zheng Yuxing.
Right. Isn't your birthday coming up?
Isn't this place closed during the day?
That's right.
Li!

What took you so long?

You always get me in trouble.

Wait, I'm almost done.

How long is "almost"?
One minute.
One minute?
Okay.
Fifty-nine.
Fifty-eight.
Fifty-seven.
What the heck?
This is actually my first time as a DJ.
This is my favorite song.
Enjoy yourself!

It's awesome.
I just made this mix.
You're the only person in the world who has this song.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
I'm talking to you.
<i>I'm back.</i>
Dad!
Of course I'm here for my daughter's birthday.
My birthday's tomorrow.
It is. After midnight, somebody is turning 18.
Wash your hands, food's ready.
You two can have some quality time together.
Have a good talk.
-Wait. -What is it?
Make a wish first.
-My birthday's tomorrow. -Make a wish.
Okay.

-Here. -I've wanted cake for so long.
It's good.
I'm going to get ready.
Be safe.
I know, bye.
to come back again at night?
Is it really different at night?
It's completely different at night.
{\an8}You'll see.
Come.
Stop pushing.
Where's Li?
He's probably inside.
Are the booths taken tonight?
No wonder your grades suck.
Girlfriend?
so you dragged her here as your shield.
But you might be disappointed today.
Ming isn't here.
No, she's not.
Her flight got delayed. She went straight to Sanya.
Xiamen is just a warm-up.
Those at the back, show me your tickets.
Wait.
Eighteen.
-She's an adult. -Is she 18?
Show me your ID.
-She didn't bring it. -Not you.
Stand aside.
Come on.
Let's see.
How is she 18? She turns 18 tomorrow.
That won't fly.
She's short by an hour.
You two can go in after midnight.
-Make an exception. -Go, wait on the side.
-No, wait on the side. -What difference is a few minutes?
It's almost your birthday.
How does being an adult feel?
Forget it.
We're already here.
It's almost time.
Let's check this out.
Li.
Stand properly.
Three,
two, one.
Happy birthday!
Okay.
Here.
For you two.
Extend your hand.
-All right, have fun. -Thank you.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Excuse me.
Chen Chen!
Chen Chen!
Why do you like this place?
Don't you think it's too loud?
Isn't that great?
The volume can drown out your worries.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Think about it.
and you make this place go wild.
Chen Chen.
Chen Chen.
Chen Chen!
Chen Chen!
I'm going home.
As for what happened earlier, I apologize, okay?
I'm not ready.
You got dumped.
How is that any of your business?
It's none of my business.
We're celebrating your birthday.
You just wanted to use me.
For what?
You thought you could win her back.
If you really like her,
get her back.
How do you know that?
If you are, why tell lies?
Why tell others that we're together?
Your mom is having an affair. Why don't you confront her?
If you have the guts, expose her.
Don't go.
I'm sorry.
Do you know?
You're really childish.
No wonder she dumped you.
-Have you ever cared for her? -Of course.
She's my daughter, I have to.
-What did you do? -I care greatly about her.
-Do you know that? -Don't keep telling me that.
I'm already in a tough spot.
I'm doing the same.
Waiter.

It's me.
If your parents don't get along,
Why can't you accept that?
If the person you love
has a new life now,
can you accept that?
See?
When it comes to others,
But what if it's about ourselves?
If so, then go tell them.
What should I say?
from living their new lives?
Can I?
Right.
but we can't help ourselves.
No.
I can't do it,
but you can.
After all, you were together before.
Even if you broke up,
she owes you an explanation.
Tell me.
After midnight, can I still make a wish?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
I wish
that we
and we
can become braver.
Everything I said…
outside the club was out of anger.
Actually…
Actually, I…
I was just jealous.
See?
Being honest isn't so hard, right?
Zheng Yuxing.
{\an8}<i>So,</i>
{\an8}<i>we've decided</i>
{\an8}<i>to take</i>
{\an8}<i>Have a nice life, everyone.</i>
Let's go.
Hurry, the car is here.

{\an8}<i>Chen Chen.</i>
{\an8}<i>We are at…</i>
{\an8}<i>Turn it off.</i>
-Is it off? -Yes.
Let's go.
Did Zheng Yuxing and Chen Chen elope?
Hey, Ms. Qu.
<i>Mrs. Chen.</i>
Isn't it the weekend? What's the matter?
<i>We're finally here.</i>
{\an8}This is Zheng Yuxing?
He's quite handsome.
Look. This video has over 10,000 likes.
He's quite popular.
Hey.
I told you not to drink, you insisted.
Didn't you drink too?
I thought she was already home.
<i>We're here.</i>
<i>We're headed to the hotel.</i>
<i>Chen Chen.</i>
{\an8}<i>We are at…</i>
<i>Turn it off.</i>
Mr. Chen, don't worry.
-Ours is a girl. -My son won't do anything
to your daughter.
Don't you think that's irresponsible for you to say?
Ms. Qu, that can't be.
It's the weekend. They're not skipping school.
-Right. -Look at the number of hits.
Other parents have already brought this up.
the consequences are unimaginable.
We can't allow their posts to get out of hand.
Otherwise, they could be expelled.
I'll call her.
-Can you think of something? -All right.
What if
I check
Zheng Yuxing's credit card records?
Aren't you being too impulsive?
Wasn't this your idea?
Come on!

{\an8}COME AND JOIN US
Ming looks cool!
Now, you owe me a secret.
I just confirmed with the hotel
that they're staying here.
Slow down.
I think that's probably why they came to Sanya.
This way.
They shut the lights down.
The next DJ is coming.
There's no need.
I couldn't let go
Ming owes me an explanation,
but because I couldn't accept
but she no longer likes me.
But from now on,
I'll try hard to accept that.
In the future,
if the people we like
how nice would that be?
Zheng Yuxing.
Let me tell you a secret.
Actually, you were right.
I've liked you since junior year.
I wish I could also like you back.
Or maybe
we should both learn to accept
that the one we like might not like us back.
WILL SHE LIVE WITH YOU?
SHE'S ALMOST 18, SHALL WE LET HER DECIDE?
<i>Who was it? Who was your boyfriend?</i>
{\an8}<i>Hi.</i>
we know.
You understand, don't you?
Rest over there.
They are already in this situation.
Let's just sign it.
Any misunderstandings?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Sorry to trouble you.
Zheng Yuxing.
I'll get her.
Chen Chen, come here for a second.
I, ZHENG YUXING, HAVE BEEN HARASSING CHEN CHEN
I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THE SCHOOL'S PUNISHMENT.
It's what Zheng Yuxing's dad wants.
He will make Zheng Yuxing say
that he singlehandedly planned this.
Be good.
Sign it.
I'm the one who wanted to come.
I'm not signing this.
You two made a big mess.
The school can't tolerate it.
So you want us to lie?
We are not making you lie.
What will happen to him? What does "punishment" here mean?
Expulsion?
It doesn't matter if he gets expelled.
His family can afford it.
What if you got expelled?
I'll do what I should do.
I'll stop school. I can quit school too.
No.
You like him.
But think about it.
Zheng Yuxing is taking responsibility for this
He's not obligated to help me.
How is he not?
I just met him this semester.
Everything is a lie.
Did you speak any truth?
You…
You want the truth?
-No, nothing you say is real. -The truth is I found out last year
that you and Dad have been divorced for a long time.
The truth is I know
that you're dating Uncle Wang.
I know Dad is with someone else.
because you thought it would affect my exam.
I failed the exam on purpose.
Actually, I finished answering everything.
I just thought
I just don't want
Mom.
I don't want you and Dad
to lie for my sake anymore.
I don't want Zheng Yuxing to lie either.
We're not signing this.
If she gets expelled, so be it.
How can she get expelled?
Let's talk when we get home.
Zheng Yuxing.
Zheng Yuxing.
Chen Chen.
I think
I've lost the hearing in my left ear.
Mom!
Mom!
Take your phones out.
Pass them to the middle.
Hurry!
Quiet.
Also, Chen Chen and Zheng Yuxing
have decided to drop out.
Do not repost their videos.
Do not discuss them either.
-The college entrance exam. -Do you--
Go to college.
<i>Mrs. Chen.</i>
<i>We still care about Chen Chen very much.</i>
<i>please let me know anytime.</i>
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Qu.
COUNTDOWN TO COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM
It's okay.
I'll fly back from there.
Okay.
How's my mom lately?
She says
and the food isn't good.
That's how
your mom is.
She doesn't say what she thinks.
the more she complains about it.
Usually,
she's really happy here.

Get in here.
Safe is safe. Hollywood is fucked right out.
What, bitch?
Somebody just tried to rob you?
Happened right in front of me.
And you know what?
Isn't that fucked up?
If he wouldn't have ran straight into traffic,
I would've caught his ass.
Asshole. I mean, bitch you crazy.
But you're not no vigilante, Kas.
You gonna get yourself killed.
I should probably shower first.
You know where the towels are.
Hey Maurice, I just saw your message.
And?
You're not listening to me.
That works better for me at this time.
No, but I...
Kassi, Kassi.
Don't call me back unless you got my money. Goodbye.
Fuck.
Yeah. I'm not too thrilled about it either.
Well, I could just drive
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. No.
Sasha doesn't want more than one car driving up there.
She's nice.
No, I'm a bitch.
And you're more than welcome, not to come. 10 minutes.
Well, honestly. I made her think that I fucked her man.
Well, that's gonna be a fun ride. Enjoy.
We? Yes girl.
You said you needed a job, right?
Yeah, but I-
Get your little bag, let's go.
I don't know. I can't just get up and go.
I might get an audition or a-
ride along with that bitch by myself.
Doesn't seem like she wants me there.

Kas, roll your window up. For Christ's sake.
Take your finger off the button. Dumb ass.
Hold on.
'cause you know I don't give a fuck.
But you better watch the way you talk to my girl.
What is that smell?
These are the killing fields.
They have them all huddled together,
trapped until they murder them.
They milk them here too, you know.
So sad.
If you can't handle that, city girl,
I can't kill animals, no matter how much they-
She's just being a bitch.
Takes one to know one.
This is California.
What do you think we'll be farming?
Pot.
I barely smoke it.
It's just basic watering, and taking off dead leaves.
Bullshit like that.
The grower does the rest
The grower? Yes, girl. Sasha.
He's my boyfriend.
He's smart.
Fuck!
Sophisticated.
We've only kicked it a few times.
Okay. That's far enough.
You think he likes you?
Hello?
Terms?
Yes, Sasha. The terms.
Those were the terms, Sasha.
You haven't answered.
I got some beautiful girls coming up here.
I can give them to you,
No.
These girls are really gorgeous.
So now I make good on my promise to you.
Goodbye, Sasha.
Dima.
You want us to take care of him?
Thank you, Yury.
Yury?
You tell him they have girls.
He brings back to me alive, okay?
Understood.
Hey, I need to call my mom while there's service,
Go ahead, girl. I'll pump.
Hello?
Hi.
Kassi? How are you?
Hey, have you talked to your manager?
I think we should leave him,
Kas, sometimes you have to give up,
and say enough's enough.
Kas, you aren't getting any younger.
Please, don't be like-
And I feel I should tell her-
No, I'm not off screwing around.
I'm going to make some money.
Who am I to tell you not to? I'm only your mother.
The lady who gave you life and shelter, and-
I promise I'll call you when I get service.
When you get service?
This makes me very uncomfortable, Kassi.
You don't want me going crazy.
Okay.
Call me in a few hours.
Bye. Bye.
Ever since reading that book
I took from that crazy lady, Velma,
it seems that the evil on this mountain,
A lady named Eve was sent here by the Catholic church
because of course they knew.
I don't know, Eve.
And she tracked her.
All the parts?
I don't think we should go any further.
People have been disappearing.
She's leading Thomas into the forest.
We must go now, girls.
We are protected by the power of God.
And we will strike this evil with his mighty sword.
Quiet, Mary.
We mustn't let anything stop us.
Quickly, Mary. The knife.
Lady Eve's failed attempt is the only known effort
that is known to wander these woods.
But a knife blessed with the blood of a virgin woman
Welcome to Chateau Sasha.
Chris, you didn't introduce me to your friend, spunky girl.
Oh yeah. Sash, this is Kas.
Pleasure.
Marissa.
Well, she's pleasant.
All right, ladies, down here.
And Christiana,
No, girl. He got his own.
ready to go to the green house.
Great.
Watch your step when you're walking through here.
and other things not too good for your health.
Of course, there's no phone service.
If you mess up, or one of the plants die,
I will bury you on the property,
never to be heard from again.
Are we understood?
All right, then.
Girl, he's just playing.
What'd you get me into?
Sucks.
Hello? I'm freaking out.
This weirdo want-to-be pimp, and his crazy ho.
Plus we're stuck in the middle of nowhere with them.
Look, girl. They're just different.
But they're cool.
more than enough to pay your water bill,
and to get those head shots you wanted.
So can you get it together? It's time for dinner.
Well, someone's got a bit of an attitude.
Would help if the bitch wasn't sitting across from me.
That's it.
None of this!
Out of my face with this.
Honestly, I- Stop it!
Now I made an amazing meal.
It's like, everybody is out to fuck Sasha.
I told her to call.
Okay. Fine.
What are you watching?
Some murder mountain shit about Humboldt County.
Kas? Where are you gonna go?
with no water and in the dark,
then be caught up in this shit.
Calm down. Put your bag down.
Kas.
Okay, let's do like we planned.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll stay.
Like you had a choice.
Friends for life.
What the hell was that?
I think it came from downstairs.
I didn't do it. I found him like this.
I told you that we slept together,
This is too much. I didn't do it.
I didn't.
She's right. We're spending too much time with this.
We should be figuring a way out of here.
Open the door! Open the door.
I forgot the fucking keys.
We have to run.
Go. I've got a cramp.
Go on. Why are you still here? You killed Sasha.
I did not kill Sasha. I loved him.
How do I know you didn't do it?
What? No, no, no. She was with me.
I was with Kassi.
Well, it wasn't me.
It had to be someone else.
Look, we can't just stand here.
I'm not running around in the dark with this bitch, so.
Come on. Let's go.
She's gotta be up there.
Would you take it down a notch?
Shit, there's places in LA I don't even get service.
She said she's going up North to make some money.
It's pretty obvious where she went.
San Francisco's up North, Sacramento.
She's there.
Sonoma? Humboldt County.
How can you tell?
I've got location tracking enabled
on all the family plan phones.
Babe, I'm on the family plan.
Sheriff Owen.
You've got to find my daughter!
Rebecca Jacobs?
where you always put it.
It's right fucking here.
Here.
Hold on. This like the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre".
running around in these woods.
This isn't a fucking movie.
Shut up.
Excuse me?
Oh, ladies. Can I help you?
Well.
Oh this? Don't pay no mind.
I was just whittling. Here, here, here.
I'm sorry, we just.
We just want to use your phone.
Well sure. Come on in.
Sure thing.
Okay. Thank you.
She killed him.
Look, I've told you 100 times.
I am calm.
I'm doing your goddamn job for you, aren't I?
Well look, I have to admit,
It's mostly through Google Maps,
and Street View that I found them.
Yes you did.
Well, you know, I know most of these people out there.
Yeah, I don't know, I guess it's worth
sending somebody out to check it out for you.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Call them now, you idiot.
when she licks you there?
Yeah, man.
At least that's how I see it.
A man's got to have some boundaries.
Boundaries?
Come on, man.
I mean, yeah man. Look look, that's all you, you know.
I just can't have a dog tongue all in my ear, you know?
Is this unhygienic.
Marlack, you got a copy?
Unhygienic?
Un-hygienic.
Marlack here. Could you repeat that? Over.
Yeah. We're about a mile away from that place.
Look, I got out some hysterical mom,
thinks her daughter's lost out there.
Phone GPS puts her in that area.
and help get this crazy-ass woman off my back?
We got a call.
Is it some bullshit?
All right. Let's go.
Here ladies. Drink up.
Becca.
Oh, and I bet you that tastes good, don't it?
Me too.
Are you okay?
Oh my God.
Chris?
What did you do?
Then she took Jonathon from me.
I knew.
Did the girl you speak of happen to look like this?
That's her. That's that terrible girl.
She took him.
She took him from me.
I will avenge him for you.
Can you please show me the direction in which she came?
Get the girl.
We got multiple bodies at this house you just sent us to.
And the girl is nowhere to be found.
and help this crazy-ass woman-
We're gonna head down the mountain and canvas the area.
Maybe she'll turn up down the road, or at the neighbor's house.
Phone GPS puts her in that area.
Yeah, I get that her phone's GPS says that she's here.
But trust me, she's not.
Call the local police, and let them know what we found.
But whatever it is, that girl had something to do with it.
Her mom called the station, trying to find her.
Maybe she got kidnapped or-
All right look.
Let's just head down the mountain, and see if she turns up.
whoever the fuck did that shit in there.
So you're awake?
You know you can get suspended for that, right?
Fuck our luck, man.
All right, let's go check this out.
Ah, and look at you.
I'm afraid I can't do that darling.
Not a sound.
and flash your tits or something.
I'm not gonna show my fucking tits.
Go fucking deal with the cops.
I'll deal with the fucking girls.
Okay, just for once in your life,
Good evening, Sir. Sorry to bother you.
We received a call from concerned mother.
We were just wondering if you've seen or heard anything.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you.
You think I want to be out here? I'm stuck.
But you have a gun.
Shoot that mother fucker! Go shoot his ass! Please?
You alone tonight, sir?
if she's seen anything?
Well, she's in her robe and curlers right now.
And believe me you don't want to be seeing that.
But just hold on a second. I'll go ask her, okay?
Thank you, sir.
Thank God.
Stay quiet, or you're gonna get a bullet in the head.
I'm gonna take a look around.
All right.
Hello?
What is that?
You don't have to be a victim too.
Just come with us.
Do I look like a victim to you, bitch?
This is Deputy Marlack. I'm coming in.
place them on the ground now.
Put the gun down.
I had no choice.
Put the gun down, ma'am. We can just talk about this.
He hit me so much.
Ma'am, drop the gun now.
No. No.
Don't point your gun. Right now.
Wait wait, wait wait wait.
What about Marissa?
You can't be serious.
You really want to die for that bitch? Let's go, girl.
We can't just leave her there. That's fucked up.
Yo, bitch. That sounds like death to me girl. Let's go.
No, I can't. I can't. I'm going in alone. I'll catch up.
Kassi, Christian a. Oh, thank God.
He's coming. He's coming.
What the fuck?
We're on this mountain with a fucking deranged killer.
And there's something else down there,
something out of this world.
Kassi's not lying.
This girl looking figure killed the old man.
What?
Yo, all I know
Yo, yo yo.
There's nothing there.
Keep your voice down. You're gonna get us all killed.
Let's keep on pushing.
Why are you girls on my property?
Come with me.
Girls, let's go.
Come on. What choice do we have?
Fuck!
if that's what you're waiting to ask me.
Can I get you some tea?
No. We've had enough tea for lifetime today. Thank you.
Well, town is 20 or so miles away.
Might be worse than the trouble you're already in.
How do you know we've been in trouble?
I've been watching you.
Oh, relax. I'm not interested in you.
Who, Sasha?
What about Sasha?
He stole something from me.
What?
which was given to her by her mother, and her mother,
which was given to her and the Devil himself.
Wait. So what would Sasha want with this book?
from the angry spirit in the woods.
Many many years ago,
there was a convent in these mountains.
And there was a girl there,
No!
I know who you are.
They told me you were evil, and you knew spell.
And you decided to come here anyway.
You're a Nun.
I came to make an offer,
to your savior.
You?
Every night I'm laid down,
When calling upon a wicked spirit,
we must make him aware of the trade that we want to happen.
In your case, there is a specific entity
My dear father from down below,
we ask for your permission to call upon
one of your children that you gracefully created.
Lillith, she's gonna leave her foolish convent,
and join you in order to do your bidding up here on Earth.
She's gone to leave her faith behind,
and sign her soul to you.
without taking something in return.
So now her spirit is trapped in this plane,
and she'll roam the woods for all of eternity,
I mean like, if the shoe fits.
Get out. Not but we-
We have to keep going.
I want to keep going. I know we need to, but she's right.
We should rest.
I don't think we're safe as long as we're up here.
You rest.
I'll keep lookout.
We gotta leave now. Wake up.
Yeah, you smell it. Which way did they go?
Run, rabbit. Yeah we're onto you now, bitches.
Run!
Don't y'all take another step now.
What are we doing?
Go on, get.
You too, fuck tits.
What do you think we should do
with these pretty little things?
I say we hog tie them to the shed,
What are you gonna do, Frank.
I like that idea.
Oh my God.
What the fuck, Heather?
Baby. Relax, man.
Relax? No, you fucking relax, man.
Baby, you know I love you.
And you can't take your fucking eyes off these.
Don't you fucking touch me.
Just gotta ween him off that tit, that's all.
Oh yeah.
Oh you're a dirty bitch, huh?
I don't like you. Come here.
Yeah, fuck you! Yeah, you think I'm a joke?
I apologize about my friend.
He's a real asshole.
Oh fuck, fuck.
No! Fuck no!
Please stop.
That's interesting.
You fucking asshole.
Ooh, you're a little feisty?
How about you, Mexicana?
Maybe a little of that?
How about this?
And get the fuck out the way. I can't see.
What?
Boys, this one thing she's tough.
Oh my God.
Fucking bitch.
What'd you say?
I said fucking bitch.
I got an idea.
We're gonna play a game.
How did it go?
Eenie,
meenie,
minie,
catch a nigger
by her toe.
If she hollers
let her go.
Eenie,
meenie,
minie.
Mo.
And you
are
it.
Clean up your mess.
Baby, if all we're gonna do is kill them,
why don't we get a little creative?
You know I want to have some fun.
How you doing?
Good boy.
Hey there, Big Red.
A little storm, we've been through them before.
Okay, buddy.
Sara?
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Are you lost?
I must apologize for just showing up
at your house out of nowhere.
but do you have kin that have gone missing?
Just my husband.
He's at the stables right now, checking on his horse.
Why do you ask?
Get!
Get out there.
Get, nigger. Get.
I said get.
Get up. Get.
Get up and move.
Keep moving, go.
Get.
What the fuck?
You're a real Picassee.
You're right.
Let's fuck 'em. They're right here, let's.
No.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Oh fuck. Fuck.
You know what, boys?
This isn't fair.
I'm gonna give them a choice. You can get raped or run.
Either way, you're fucked.
Now get up. I said move.
Get.
Get.
You fucking ass hat.
Will you two stop chasing each other's dicks,
and get these girls before this whole thing
turns into a real fuck up?
Get!
Oh, that pussy smells real nice.
Bet you a blow job I can nab them first.
Run, rabbit.
Who the fuck did this? Who did this?
Frank? James?
Kas, help me.
Let's hide. They're gonna get us. Just hide.
What do you mean hide? Let's keep going.
I'm not running no more. Look, let's hide please.
Let's hide. Where are we gonna go?
Let's go, we have to run!
Darling, you gotta excuse my friends.
They can be a little inappropriate
Me, I believe in the golden rule.
You got to treat others like.
Well, you know the rest.
These are my woods.
You want to play with me?
Ooh.
We gonna skin us a little piggy today.
You want to play with me?
I like games.
There's a house or something. I don't know. I see a house.
Kassi.
You, you fucking retarded ass bitch.
You got us fucked up.
She always run her mouth like that?
How long you known her, and never done that?
Move.
Go!
Get moving, bitch.
Get down, nigger lover. Get.
I said you'd be fucked either way.
Get. Get. I said get.
Get in the mud. Get down.
Get. Get.
I was once like you.
I used to wear the habit, then they stole my dignity.
Do you think this will save you from being cast back
Speak now, demon.
Isn't that what they did to you?
Those people? The way you're taught to fear everything?
Let me help you.
Don't you want to avenge them?
They will just be more.
Go.
Isn't it just so peaceful?
Thank you for bringing me.
You gotta love the green.
Gotta love it.
What? What's wrong?
You're gonna fucking smoke that right now?
What more could you need to be relaxed?
This is my breathing exercise.
It's not the same. Nice try, but not.
Inhale, exhale.
You know where I'm from?
What the fuck does that even mean?
What the fuck does that even mean?
You ain't never gonna understand what it means.
Yeah, just like you're never gonna fucking listen to me.
What the fuck? Yo, call the cops. Call the cops.
There go you're fucking cops, tough guy.
Fuck you.
You would have called the cops too.
Yeah, I would have. I'm white.
why don't you tell me
how this whole thing got started, again?
Yeah, yeah yeah.
You and the other thousand idiots that come up
through here every year, like it's a fucking gold rush.
Okay so, this guy, Sasha.
You and your friends decided to murder him and his crew.
Or how about this?
You guys decided to rob them, and it all went to shit.
I keep trying to tell you.
I didn't kill anybody, and you're not listening.
and you're just an innocent bystander.
There was something, someone in that house.
And I think that's what was trying to follow us, or kill us.
I don't know.
All right, go on then.
Tell me how these other people die.
What happened to them?
that fucked their sister, or whatever they were,
And I thought she was gonna shoot me next.
And I held her under water.
looking for help, and now I'm here.
Well, Kassi, you may not want to tell me
everything that happened today,
What?
You just confessed to murder?
Murder is illegal in this county,
Kassi.
That bitch, she killed two of my friends.
Tell me who really sent you here. Huh?
I just want to speak to my lawyer.
You have everything on tape.
I'm not saying anything else.
On tape?
Listen, honey.
I told you, you get one chance to cooperate, right?
I am cooperating.
Really?
I tell you what.
give you a little bit of leniency.
I would take advantage of that opportunity.
I'm the last law man around here for 100 miles.
You and your friends, you killed my last two deputes.
You owe me, girly girl.
What? What is this?
What was that?
That's Kassi. She's just checking in.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's okay.
She's always okay.
Shit's about to get lit.
Did I tell you Mathew was a producer?
Speaking about friends, who's this?
This is my new roommate, Lilly.
Well, welcome to Hollywood.

Britney! Britney! Britney!
<i>When I was 8, my mom realized I could sing.</i>
<i>I've always wanted to sing.</i>
<i>It's just something I've always wanted to do.</i>
<i>It's not just luck. Everybody needs a little bit of luck.</i>
<i>Everything about her was strong and fearless.</i>
<i>I mean, there was no stopping her.</i>
<i>and it was clear she was having a crisis.</i>
<i>What began as temporary control over her life</i>
<i>They felt they had to do it to protect Britney.</i>
<i>She doesn't have basic human rights.</i>
<i>She can't write a check or have a credit card.</i>
<i>If she doesn't behave, she loses custody of her kids.</i>
<i>I just want my life back. And it's been 13 years and it's enough.</i>
All right, so let's do our least favorite thing in the world,
which just means calling random strangers and saying,
I'm directing a project about Britney.
Hey, this is Jenny Eliscu.
I'm not sure if you remember me from, uh, years ago.
We met when I was working on a <i>Rolling Stone</i> article about Britney.
<i>The movie was going to be about her artistry and the media portrayal.</i>
<i>And can someone say wow to those dance moves?</i>
<i>Full of conspiracy and rumors.</i>
<i>And no one would talk.</i>
<i>I was 10 when Britney came on the scene.</i>
<i>I was obsessed.</i>
Britney! Britney!
Britney had a work ethic like none other,
but she's never been motivated by money.
She just was doing something she loved.
<i>♪ I'm a slave for you ♪</i>
<i>The best thing about being famous is knowing that, financially,</i>
<i>I'll be able to support my family, no matter what.</i>
Britney Spears!
<i>Hit after hit.</i>
<i>Then, suddenly, Britney stopped making music.</i>
<i>She fell in love with a backup dancer, Kevin Federline.</i>
<i>They got married and quickly had two children.</i>
<i>But two years later, the marriage was over and Britney had filed for divorce.</i>
Britney Spears is leaving K-Fed!
Confetti!
<i>Now hopefully, with her divorce almost finalized,</i>
<i>was really the end.</i>
<i>The very first time I was assigned Britney,</i>
<i>I was working for an agency, okay?</i>
"<i>When she comes out, follow her."</i>
<i>I excelled and I learned the job real quick.</i>
<i>There's nothing sexier than waking up and they say,</i>
<i>Male, female, actor, singer, sports celebrity.</i>
<i>So, as a photographer,</i>
<i>Britney was relentlessly chased by the paparazzi.</i>
Beautiful.
<i>One night, the agency calls me</i>
<i>and tells me the gas station that Britney's at.</i>
<i>At the gas station, everyone's taking pictures.</i>
<i>She was having problems with the gas.</i>
<i>I asked Britney, "Can I help you?"</i>
<i>So I start doing it.</i>
<i>And then, one day a photographer calls me and says, "Britney's asking for you."</i>
<i>Then another photographer calls me who doesn't know the first photographer.</i>
<i>She felt better if I was present. She felt safer.</i>
<i>Those are her words, not mine.</i>
Where's Adnan?
He's off.
He's out today.
I'll let him know.
<i>It was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know?</i>
Oh, my Lord.
<i>We didn't have that balance.</i>
<i>There was this multimillionaire and me.</i>
<i>that if anything happens to her,</i>
<i>when you're going through a child custody case.</i>
Hi, Adnan, how are you?
<i>What was apparent to me during this divorce with Kevin</i>
<i>Not Mom, not Dad, not friends</i>, <i>not her sister.</i>
<i>Anybody.</i>
<i>And that's a very scary, dark place to be.</i>
The hearing this afternoon had to do with a continued interim,
or temporary order,
that was based on Mr. Federline's original request to modify custody.
<i>What many thought would be a simple case, guided by a strong prenuptial agreement,</i>
<i>Ironclad prenup's a little bit like the </i>Titanic<i> could never sink.</i>
<i>For every ironclad prenup, there's a group of attorneys out there</i>
Mark Vincent Kaplan, he's the K-Fed lawyer.
you might call in a contentious divorce custody case.
He seemed to love being the spokesperson
for this high-profile divorce and custody case.
And he definitely has a flair for making a public statement.
<i>How safe are the children?</i>
<i>The kids become just pawns.</i>
risks that would otherwise be constantly visited upon them.
that is relevant to their best interest.
All of those things are true.
I'd represented high-profile people and celebrities before,
but this was an order of magnitude far different than anything I'd experienced.
Kevin had been treated pretty unfairly.
Why'd you think that was?
she was America's sweetheart. And in many respects, she still is.
And they saw Kevin as someone who in their view, whoever "their" is,
The press was brutal.
But as the case progressed,
um, I think she did certain things
<i>The media focused less on her music</i>
by fall of 2007.
I don't know how long the estrangements were, where...
Whether there was maybe sporadic communication,
having a fear that her family would barge in,
I think is how it was put, and take everything.
Who is Sam Lutfi?
<i>There was a lot of controversy around Sam Lutfi</i>
<i>and what role he played in this brief period of Britney's life.</i>
First question. Can you please introduce yourself to us?
- Uh, I'm Sam Lutfi. - And who are you?
I'm Britney Spears's former manager.
<i>In that time period, he went from being the sometimes friend</i>
<i>to somebody calling the shots.</i>
She was very funny.
Uh, we had a great conversation.
She asked for my phone number.
"I need your help."
Hey, guys. Just be careful.
Just clear this side for a second.
And my question to her the whole time was,
"There's nothing like having your mom around."
We would talk about Lynne,
And how was her father Jamie involved?
Not at all.
Uh, from what I believe, it's been years.
<i>♪ It's Britney, bitch ♪</i>
<i>The album was </i>Blackout <i>and it sold in the millions.</i>
<i>of what had become the story of Britney's real life.</i>
<i>A woman hunted and often on the run.</i>
<i>This would foreshadow a much darker turn for Britney.</i>
<i>There are paparazzi images of Britney in 2007</i>
<i>"Meltdown" or "Rock Bottom."</i>
<i>a person who needed help.</i>
<i>Throughout that year, paparazzi continued to follow Britney aggressively</i>
She's crazy.
Oh, my God.
<i>something terrible could happen.</i>
<i>You know, and I fucking hate that word.</i>
<i>or would you say she was hurt?</i>
<i>I'd choose all of them before I'd choose crazy.</i>
<i>In January 2008, police were called to Britney's residence.</i>
<i>She had locked herself in a room,</i>
<i>at the court appointed time.</i>
Listen up!
Cedar Sinai, this is their property,
including the sidewalk that you are standing on.
When we were on tour,
I mean, she and Lynne talked at least...
Oh, gosh. At the very least, two or three times a day.
Okay, I don't wanna talk about her daddy. I don't wanna talk about Jamie.
Um...
Jamie wasn't with us very often, hardly ever.
Um, so it really was me and Lynne.
<i>A few days after Britney was released from the hospital,</i>
<i>Her name was Louise Taylor.</i>
What I would like to say is that
What they don't know about Jamie and Lynne Spears is that every day,
asking the Lord to give him the strength to honor the people he works for
She loves her daughter so much.
And again, asking every day for God to give her strength
would be interceding for this family because Jamie Spears,
Lynne Spears, Bryan, and Jamie Lynn Spears
are all amazing people.
Who is Lou Taylor?
I will not touch that one.
Sorry.
<i>The custody suit grew more contentious</i>
Mr. Spears, what's going on? How's Britney doing?
Can you give us any word, any news on Britney?
<i>for a new legal arrangement.</i>
<i>It was called a conservatorship.</i>
I didn't give a shit about Britney Spears or pop music personally.
It's not something I paid attention to at all.
Then I met her, and she was just so likable and sweet.
So, in late 2008, when I was assigned to do another cover story
and, you know, went to L.A.
And she would say, "Oh, you know, we know Britney loves you,
but we just... The conservatorship, we've got to."
and giving them to some third party, aka their conservator,
or in other states, it's the guardian.
Obviously, any process to deprive someone of those liberties
Some people have called conservatorship tantamount to a civil death.
There's conservatorship of the person,
related to your personal affairs.
They lose the ability to decide anything related to their healthcare,
so their ability to provide or withhold informed consent
for treatments, including drugs, is taken away from them.
And, in many cases, they lose their right
They lose their right to communicate with people of their choosing
they're no longer in charge of their money,
You had Jamie who had bankruptcy issues
and financial mismanagement of his own life,
and they said, "We have Andrew Wallet here as the co-conservator,
and has a fiduciary interest,"
but in court documents,
he talked about the conservatorship as being a "hybrid business model."
According to the papers filed with the court on February 6, 2008,
They can enter and take possession of her house, kick people out,
they can use Britney's money to pay attorneys for matters
and met him and worked with him,
and even had positive experiences with him,
where they felt they needed to keep away certain people,
and he was like the bouncer. He could keep people out.
Here we've got...
Larry Rudolph, Britney's longtime manager.
But, uh, in April of 2007, Britney fired him.
Larry was the main person that Jamie Spears brought back
Louise Taylor, aka Lou, led business decisions at times
Louise Taylor's husband, Rob Taylor,
before the conservatorship.
And we know this because there is paparazzi footage of her
with Britney's father, Jamie.
And then she somehow managed to become Britney's business manager.
<i>Lou Taylor, through her attorney Charles Harder,</i>
<i>The letter was extensive.</i>
<i>When I got this notice, I was alarmed.</i>
<i>was not unusual for people involved in the story.</i>
<i>While Lou's involvement with Britney wasn't clear,</i>
This is paperwork relating to Britney's condition
because it's orders related to dementia placement.
You don't usually see dementia mentioned with, you know, with a young person.
because when someone is being made a conservatee,
they have time to do that.
The only reason given for depriving Britney of five days' notice
is that Sam Lutfi is dangerous and needs to be kept away.
Don't push! Don't push.
Get off! Off! Off!
<i>It was total crisis mode with Sam,</i>
<i>and that is something that I don't believe has really been portrayed correctly,</i>
<i>is the level of crisis</i>
Oh, my God, please get the out of the way!
Get out, get out, get out. Thank you.
<i>They felt they had to do it to protect Britney from Sam.</i>
that something dangerous was happening with Sam.
What do you think was going to happen?
<i>He was crushing drugs and putting them in her food</i>
Drive my car, that's what I got to do.
You have a hundred blood tests and drug tests.
The entire time I was with her, she passed every single one of them,
No one called the police.
that you're drugging the world's biggest star, you call the police.
I was just an expendable guy.
She would have obviously contested it. They knew that, everyone knew that.
<i>Sam would later sue Lynne Spears, Britney's mom,</i>
<i>As I am told, they both entered the restaurant,</i>
<i>and Britney sort of did an about-face,</i>
<i>Uh, she called me and said that she needed help.</i>
<i>We called Adam.</i>
<i>We were chased probably by, I don't know, 50, 75 vehicles.</i>
'cause we had helicopters swirling over the building.
There must have been a hundred paparazzi.
I sent down my secretary,
who brought a guy from the mailroom
to help Britney get up from the garage to my office.
Yes.
Just follow me.
My secretary, Dolores Gameros,
who's like 5'4", was elbowing everybody out of the way
Don't kick me!
But I can tell you what I told the court.
So we walk into court and I said,
"She wants an independent to be the conservator."
She clearly understood the concept of a conservatorship.
it's inappropriate to have a family member as the conservator.
as the conservator.
And the reason is that family relationships are always complex.
When I told the judge what Britney wanted,
the judge looked at me and said,
"So I'm sorry, Mr. Streisand,
Can you give us a heads-up on what happened here today?
No, I'm sorry.
- I've talked to the press. - How's Britney?
There's no law that says that conservatees
have the right to the attorney of their choice.
They have what's called this volunteer panel of lawyers,
Doesn't mean they're working for free. Far from it.
But they volunteer to get appointed by the court
to represent people like Britney,
I can't tell you what happened in court after I left.
who was appointed as her lawyer, argued the way that I argued,
that the conservator shouldn't be Britney's father.
I've got my suspicions.
I sure hope Sam Ingham fought hard against, uh, against it,
but I never heard that he did.
We have very particular standards for conservatorship.
I've represented dozens of conservatees in court,
not one of them has ever had a job.
<i>"Nope. She no longer has rights or say over anything."</i>
<i>I watched her write the </i>Blackout<i> album on a Starbucks napkin</i>
<i>on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City.</i>
<i>I watched her sit there and put the moves together.</i>
<i>what colors to use and, you know, the scenery,</i>
<i>that her father's gonna get a conservatorship?</i>
<i>It didn't make sense to me.</i>
I'm from <i>In Touch</i> magazine.
Let me give you a fucking clue, I don't talk to no-fucking-body.
Why don't you talk to us?
'Cause I never have to talk to anybody, you dumb fuck.
The source said,
"This is a confidential report only a select few have access."
"Most doctors and other professionals
have not been publicly connected to the case
and would like to remain that way."
"The report was produced by a doctor that resigned from the case in 2013."
"Britney Spears lacks capacity to retain and direct counsel."
her own financial affairs without being subject to undue influence."
<i>What's wild is, at the same time this report was written,</i>
<i>Britney was back to work.</i>
Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me,
<i>The episode was out within two months of the conservatorship starting.</i>
Yet we have paperwork that says she had dementia.
How is someone who is that ill well enough to go to work?
"Caution should also be exercised
so as not to accelerate her return to work
<i>The medical team said that Britney lacked capacity,</i>
<i>but who was the original doctor that made that decision?</i>
<i>there was only one name listed in the initial evaluation,</i>
<i>a Dr. J. Edward Spar.</i>
We're ready for slate.
<i>And what the justification was.</i>
Dr. James, uh...
Take one, mark.
Thank you.
Dr. Spar, tell me about your work.
I am a retired, uh, geriatric psychiatrist
and still do the occasional consultation for attorneys,
Had you heard of Britney Spears' music before you met her?
- Wait, before I met her? - Yeah.
Oh, wait, I'm not going to acknowledge that I've ever met her.
Well, I'm a geriatric psychiatrist,
so that's one of the things that geriatric psychiatrists
So here is a court document
Okay. Again, show me my signed declaration.
whether anybody ever retained me to see anybody, not just Britney Spears.
These are confidential evaluations.
that conservatorships are, um, mostly to help people?
The ones where I have been involved,
the person who's filing for the conservatorship
Usually, most of the cases I've been involved in,
what they're trying to protect them from
is a predatory individual after that person's money.
<i>I get a phone call from her father.</i>
<i>And he said, "No, you need to bring her home now."</i>
<i>for me to pull up at the gates</i>
<i>And they're standing there, and she freaks out.</i>
<i>"What are they doing here? Why are they here?"</i>
<i>And she looks at me.</i>
<i>I'm supposed to be the one that protects her.</i>
<i>"And it's that real."</i>
<i>She just looks. She doesn't talk anymore. She's completely silent.</i>
<i>That's when the realization was,</i>
<i>"Okay, I don't think things are gonna be the same."</i>
<i>As 2008 continued, Britney had reportedly negotiated</i>
<i>50-50 custody of her kids.</i>
<i>and work she did.</i>
<i>It started with recording a new album,</i>
<i>This MTV Film would be called</i> For the Record.
<i>This was a new time in Britney's professional life,</i>
and people who were sort of from the outside.
and realizing that, like, there wasn't a single person
that was involved with that project
Like, not a single person.
and all that kind of stuff,
It's like... It's bad.
I'm sad.
And, uh, keeping her busy. You know, like me, I like to go fishing.
She likes to sing and dance. She likes to work.
Are they gonna bring something here or something?
- Except me. - Except you.
Is that my car?
I was there that day, and I remember,
Thirty people have to arrange this whole thing
to let her drive her car to feel free for 30 minutes?
Like, in what context?
The whole thing is fucked up. I'm sorry.
Britney and I had become close.
There were times she'd ask me for help,
whether it was questions about legal issues
or, you know, stuff about conservatorships.
Um, and I would usually try and deflect these things
This <i>People</i> article came out.
And there was stuff she didn't really agree with.
"And as for Kevin saying Britney divorced him,
and he wouldn't see her and the children."
<i>"</i>And her lawyer said if she doesn't divorce him, he's gonna do it himself."
"So, Kevin trying to play the innocent victim is hardly irrelevant."
"He left her and the babies."
"Her children were taken away and she did spin out of control,
"This year, Britney's been silenced to speak out about anything that's going on."
"She would love for new eyes to see her situation,
"As long as the people are getting paid and she has no rights,
"Britney's given her brother a $2 million apartment,
her mother an estate in Louisiana,
and her father the best job in show business."
"She's a very giving person and would love to get the respect she deserves."
It was an emotional response to the article coming out,
but like trying to use my phone to call people.
But you had enough foresight to copy the letter?
I mean, again, like, I always just felt bad for her.
How much longer did you work with Britney after that?
Um...
And maybe we were too close at that point.
I actually... I don't think I've spoken to her since.
And Britney had met a bunch of my friends.
and we had kept in touch even after it came out.
Then he told me about the fact that he and Adnan had been trying
to come up with a plan to help her find a different lawyer.
She still, in January of 2009,
still wanted a different lawyer if she could get one.
This was a full year of the conservatorship
supposedly having saved her life.
They had been talking to different lawyers
who thought that if they could get her to sign this document
saying why she wanted a new lawyer and why she wanted the specific lawyer
and there would be no way to refute it.
At that time, Sam and Adnan were persona non grata.
I can't say there was a specific moment that convinced me to do it.
Of course, I was concerned about being a participant in the story
I was trying to cover objectively.
But, at that point, I had known Britney Spears for a decade almost,
that I could be more useful as a Good Samaritan almost
Anything to say about the conservatorship today?
And she would know to come meet me in the bathroom.
I just walked in thinking, "Pretend I'm a guest."
and then went into this small bathroom.
and saw her tattoo on her foot or ankle or whatever it is,
And she signed and looked at me and said, "Thank you."
And I said...
And we thought that when he sees that she signed it,
he'll know that things are gonna change.
that it was all over and that, similar to what had happened with Adam Streisand,
and still no one really talks about the fact
<i>But someone else knew about the incident at the Montage.</i>
<i>the court-appointed lawyer for the conservatorship, Sam Ingham,</i>
<i>stated that Britney told him she'd met with a reporter</i>
<i>and asked him to do whatever is necessary to "squash the document."</i>
<i>She further stated that she was,</i>
<i>"Fully satisfied with my representation of her."</i>
<i>That same day, the attorney she had tried to hire, John Anderson, withdrew, stating,</i>
<i>It was another time that Britney had tried to seek her own representation</i>
<i>and it failed.</i>
who is tasked with making the conservatee's best case
for whatever the conservatee wants.
are not representing what their clients want.
Keep in mind that the only way that Sam Ingham gets paid
Obviously, there is a natural tendency to say,
What is your reaction to knowing that a court-appointed attorney
is making over 3 million dollars, like as... In this position?
Are you concerned for Britney's mental health?
<i>By early 2009,</i>
<i>Jamie Spears asked that the temporary conservatorship of his daughter</i>
<i>And there was a range of new specific powers and privileges</i>
<i>to giving him more complete control over Britney's personal finances.</i>
<i>Perhaps most importantly, though, the permanent conservatorship</i>
<i>Britney was preparing for a huge tour,</i>
<i>whatever concerns the conservatorship's medical team had</i>
Sales have generated about 40 million.
Second, there seems to be an opportunity to add two shows
at the end of the U.S. leg on very attractive financial terms.
So this is before the Circus tour.
- but they're adding more dates. - Right.
They went from temporary conservatorship to permanent conservatorship,
So us noting that there was financial incentives for Larry, for Jamie,
<i>The Circus tour was performed over the course of nine months</i>
to prove that what they decided to do was the right decision.
Britney!
Britney!
There's nothing relaxing about being on a tour.
Flying all over the world,
I can only imagine how stressful and challenging that might be for her.
It's like, that's hard.
<i>The conservatorship stated that they had successfully added</i>
"Her main focus, almost to the point of obsession,
was getting more time with her children."
"Her second preoccupation was whether the conservatorship would end
Oh, man. She gets an allowance, she's got "privileges,"
That's the patriarchy.
<i>It was her agent, Jason Trawick.</i>
<i>he was featured in Britney's music video "Criminal."</i>
Wait.
Now I'm okay.
Jason was, like, a very smart, very sweet, very caring...
Like, he was one of the guys that I would confide in,
and we would talk about all that was happening.
because, at the time, neither of us were dating her or engaged to her
or anything like that.
To see the role that he transitioned into,
Bet you know what that means.
Britney!
So this is from a doctor with the conservatorship to Sam Ingham.
"I found him to be forthcoming and open, though fearful that whatever he said
might be held against him or place him at odds with others
"His philosophy is Britney will have to learn to live without a conservator."
"Jason states inconveniences Britney has to go through
"For example, they wanted to drive within a gated community on a golf cart,
but have to ask permission each time."
"If they want to go out to a hamburger joint,
they have to call for permission and wait 20 minutes or more for an answer."
"If Britney needs a few hundred dollars to buy books for her kids,
What the fuck?
significant tensions arose between Jamie Spears,
Right, and then look at this.
"She is especially adamant that Jamie be punished."
about the conservatorship itself."
"In a simple way, she feels that if she is drug tested, so should he be."
"If she were to suffer a great penalty, like losing her kids,
he should suffer an equally great penalty for his drinking."
"Britney wants to come off the conservatorship."
but mostly she wants to end the conservatorship of the person."
The conservatorship has maintained Britney has never once asked for it
But we have here in evidence that she wanted out of the conservatorship,
that she was vocalizing that need, and that it was ignored.
<i>In December 2011, Britney and Jason became engaged.</i>
<i>Four months later, she requested Jason be added as her conservator.</i>
<i>But instead of Jason replacing Jamie,</i>
<i>the court ruled in what could be considered a compromise.</i>
At the time, I thought that it was interesting
<i>With her father and fiancé as co-conservators of her person,</i>
<i>Britney inked a reported $15 million deal to judge </i>X Factor.
<i>Behind the scenes, confidential reports given to us</i>
<i>showed that the conservatorship was in chaos.</i>
<i>The medical team thought that</i> X Factor <i>put undue pressure on Britney,</i>
<i>whereas her management said that withdrawing would be just as bad</i>
<i>Under intense pressure from Britney's management,</i>
<i>but said there would be strict guidelines for their approval to stay in place,</i>
And then the big bombshell is that we have direct evidence
that her medication, the medication that she liked to take,
There's different dosages on,
valued the benefits of stimulants for Britney's performance."
"This had been the case for her tours and for her participation on X Factor."
"<i>By the same token, Jamie wanted</i> B <i>ritney not to take stimulants."</i>
<i>From the public's perspective,</i>
<i>Britney's performance on </i>The X Factor<i> was a success.</i>
<i>Less than a year later, though, Britney and Jason would break up,</i>
"On the subject of X Factor itself,
"Instead, her current plan is to create a Las Vegas-style revue
to perform at a Las Vegas hotel over three- or four-day weekend dates
What does it say right after that?
"I believe this is an appropriate career move
from the perspective of her psychiatric condition."
It's so hot.
Okay, so...
...has been very, very, very profound.
<i>Very little is known about Britney's life during this time period.</i>
<i>The conservatorship kept her inner circle very small.</i>
<i>Candid Britney interviews were rare.</i>
<i>when she was talking to her audience.</i>
Honestly, without the music, just the mic, it kind of feels illegal.
Like it's quiet right now, and it...
It feels so weird.
But I just want to make sure
<i>When she found out I was there, she wanted to see me backstage.</i>
<i>And it was like we both just immediately just embraced and just cried,</i>
<i>I think that's why we both broke down and cried.</i>
<i>"In the nine years I've worked for her, I've never seen her smile like that."</i>
<i>It's myself, Felicia and a couple other people.</i>
and then the four years in Vegas.
I had much less contact with her.
But I made sure, every show, she knew I was there.
And then did she continue to love performing?
I mean, it's such an intense schedule.
Um...
I'm sorry.
<i>The one thing we know for sure is that Britney worked almost nonstop</i>
<i>It would be called Domination.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen, Britney Spears!
<i>When she walked dow</i> n <i>the red carpet,</i>
<i>But then she didn't.</i>
<i>Three months later, via Instagram,</i>
<i>Britney would cancel the show, citing family health concerns.</i>
That was a huge moment when the fan community began to suspect
in, like, weeks, if not months.
And cut to April 2019,
I've heard from many different quarters
then throw it over an electrified fence to an unsuspecting gardener.
If she wanted to get a message out as far as being held against her will,
I can't even imagine the numbers of ways she can do that.
<i>so I just needed time to deal. Don't worry, I'll be back very soon.</i>
<i>The video only increased public speculation.</i>
<i>What was going on inside the conservatorship,</i>
<i>and why was she in one if she was, quote, "okay"?</i>
We know that in summer of 2019,
had a restraining order filed against Jamie,
a door was broken down, one of her sons was shaken.
Um, the restraining order was based on an unauthorized...
Uh, let's just say it had to do with conduct
that put the children in fear of their safety.
How did a door get broken?
and, uh, it caused the door to come off the hinge or something in that regard.
<i>At the end of 2019,</i>
<i>had lost $400,000 in billing in 2019</i>
<i>She requested a minimum of $500,000.</i>
<i>Yet it was a time when Britney wasn't working.</i>
<i>he paid the funds the next day.</i>
This is what Jamie Spears, in July 2020,
said of Britney Spears,
Why don't we do here?
"James P. Spears respectfully submits this status update
to provide information in advance of and regarding some of the topics
in the amount of $1 million."
in her own financial well-being
Mr. Spears has been working to establish a model
where Ms. Spear's current lifestyle can be preserved
and her needs met based solely on passive income."
and this enormous cost of maintaining her lifestyle,
this is a tall order."
and describing her and criticizing her and limiting her,
- How do you get out? - I just...
You don't get out until you scream.
I feel like, maybe I'd apologize.
I feel like I didn't, you know, do enough,
It just seems like it keeps getting worse.
It feels like something's gonna happen. Definitely, something's gonna happen.
So you're in?
It's not playing anything.
This is us trying to get into the court hearing.
and $60 million fortune.
Going through introductions- slash-formalities, Britney says, quote,
<i>I have a lot to say, so bear with me.</i>
<i>I'll recap.</i>
<i>I was on tour. My management said if I don't do this,</i>
<i>It was very threatening and scary,</i>
<i>and with the conservatorship, I couldn't even get my own attorney.</i>
<i>So, out of fear, I went ahead and I did the tour.</i>
<i>I started rehearsing early, but it was hard</i>
<i>'cause I'd been doing Vegas for four years and I needed a break in between.</i>
<i>I was basically directing most of the show.</i>
<i>I taught my dancers my new choreography myself.</i>
<i>I wasn't good. I was great.</i>
<i>He immediately, the next day, put me on lithium out of nowhere.</i>
<i>compared to what I was used to.</i>
<i>my dad was all for it.</i>
<i>He loved every minute of it.</i>
<i>after I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and happy,</i>
<i>it's a lie.</i>
<i>I thought maybe I said that enough, maybe I might become happy</i>
<i>because I've been in denial, I've been in shock.</i>
<i>I am traumatized.</i>
<i>But now I'm telling you the truth.</i>
<i>I'm not happy. I can't sleep.</i>
<i>I'm so angry, it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day.</i>
<i>like I didn't matter.</i>
<i>and the degree and the damage that they did to me back then.</i>
<i>It's embarrassing and demoralizing what I've been through,</i>
<i>'cause I honestly didn't think anyone would believe me.</i>
<i>and literally watch me make a living for so many people</i>
<i>and be told I'm not good enough.</i>
<i>But I'm great at what I do.</i>
Britney, Britney, Britney!
<i>I feel ganged up on, and I feel bullied,</i>
<i>and I feel left out and alone.</i>
<i>I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does</i>
<i>That's all I wanted to say to you,</i>
<i>and thank you so much for letting me speak to you today.</i>
'It was two of us...'
...and the third was our fate...'
'Which I guess was upset with us and had retreated in a shell.'
'Place was Mumbai, and it's hustle-bustle.'
'We became engineers...'
'...and matched steps with the crowd tofind a job in this ferocious city.'
"It's being said that he took this extreme step due to lack of job."
These news channels are out of their mind, you know.
What?
There's nothing wrong in it.
Right.
...we did.
...unlike you.
You can't even find a decent job.
What's your salary?
Throw a party?
I've been telling you to help me with my startup...
...and things will fall in place.
What's the point?
You can't run a little sideshow...
...and think you can run a circus.
See...
- Look at Mr. Sharma's son. - Right...
And he has a fat package.
You're always giving his mom an eyeful.
Don't start this in the morning.
Amazing.
Don't pay attention to him.
Off you go to work.
And have this on the way. Okay.
Why an apple?
Oh, that reminds me.
What?
Keep these in the locket on your way.
Right, papa. You know what, I'll get married...
...and we'll ask for a lot of dowry. And use that to pay back the loan.
His face just lit up.
- Bye, mom. - Bye.
Let's start looking at available prospects.
I will watch it.
At least the TV listens to me.
Success shall be yours.
Guruji, I got to take this. I am really sorry.
Yeah, babes. Say.
On my way to the office. You continue.
I can't come, babes. I am on my way.
But last time you said blue.
Blue? I never said it.
I wasn't talking to you.
Babes, how can I come?
Don't get angry...
Okay. I'll figure out something. I'll come. Okay.
So, tell me.
Doing what?
Marriage, of course. We'll get married.
But I can't rebel against my parents.
If you want to marry me...
My dad is already looking for a prospective husband.
Being the zonal head of a multination company is not a small post.
Promotions are due this week.
Even your dad will feel proud when I tell him.
Wow!
Sameer, life isn't a Shahrukh Khan movie.
Anyway, I'm going to dinner with him tonight.
And you've to come.
8 pm, Grand Palace.
Be there by 7:30.
Boo...
What are you searching for?
Leave it.
Let's go give ourselves heartburn.
Hey Bruce Lee. Tea.
Can you ever get a hot cup of tea?
Get lost.
If only my startup on track...
Why don't you talk to the company clients?
If I steal my company's clients...
...I'll go straight to hell.
This isn't exactly paradise.
No...
Well, I'll send you the client details.
Hey...it's Hitler. Throw the cigarette.
Throw your cigarette.
Hi, guys.
What's up?
No, sir, I've been around.
He should know that we respect him.
You threw it away earlier, did he know?
Listen, I've a client meeting. I need to leave early.
You'll be using your dad as an excuse.
Tell Chitra to look after her dad, okay.
Bye.
Sir is calling you. Please come.
Mechanical Bond to bring a change.
That's my presentation, guys! What do you think about it?
Your presentation is good.
Thank you.
But you'll have to make the initial investment.
Okay.
Startup what?
Which according to the client will be compensated in the first month.
I see...
- 2 million. - Yes.
Is that it?
Thank you, Bhau.
Consider it done.
Don't worry.
Thank you, Bhau.
How much is 2 million?
- True. True. - Isn't it?
Fuc*** Katya!
That's all you say.
What were you saying?
Come collect 2 million from me next week.
Don't be shy.
But not now.
First service to God.
- Yeah... - Then your reward.
Of course. Of course.
You'll remember this deal.
It won't happen on its own.
Of course, Bhau.
- Will you volunteer? - Yes.
Or just take the reward.
No, no...
Starting today, you're one of my volunteers.
Come in. Come in, Sameer.
I am giving these files to Priyanka.
Just give her a hand.
It's very important.
And anyway, everyone in the office needs your help.
I just hope I get what I deserve, sir.
You deserve the best, Sameer.
What? Girlfriend?
It's okay. I'll manage.
Listen...
I know how to handle him.
Don't try to handle me.
And get to work.
Okay, as you wish.
"The sun's shining over the head."
"Take a deep breath of fresh air..."
"I wonder when will this borrowed life change."
"Cruel life."
"Cruel life."
"Cruel life."
"Cruel life."
"Screws me with a smile, this cruel life."
You're a shoo-in for promotion.
Are you looking for double-promotion with extra effort?
Let's go get a cup of tea.
"I wonder when he'll scoop in my chance."
"I am dangling between hell and high water."
No need to show up. Dinner's over.
Shilpa will never be angry with you again.
- Are you serious? - Dump Shilpa.
"He's set out with an empty suitcase."
"...and his knowledge of galore."
"With a fake face that wins hearts..."
"I wonder when this messed up life will change."
Bhau, I've seen a space for the office.
But I need to pay an advance.
Which I don't have.
Arrange for it. It's only for a week.
You're like a kid to me.
Go check the sound.
Yes... yes...
"Cruel life."
No, please. Don't be like this.
I've other clients ready to pay in full.
If you don't pay advance tomorrow, you'll lose the place.
"Cruel life."
You aren't even answering my calls.
Forget all that.
For the last time, are you coming to meet dad or not?
When do we meet?
Then come to Delhi.
Delhi?
I've to go to Delhi.
Why Delhi?
- Where? Delhi? - No.
What Delhi?
Will Bhau give you money?
He's a rich guy.
I am just suggesting. Have a backup.
2 bottles of mustard oil.
Incense,
Yeah... Priest.
Nothing. Still trying every trick in the book.
But nothing solid is happening.
The government's unpredictable, but I know a guy.
If he can be any use to you, you'll have your backup.
Backup? Who is he?
Billu bhai, but he lives in Delhi.
He's a great guy, Ajay. Believe me.
My uncle needed money.
He approached everyone but to no avail.
He's got great connections.
Listen...did you ask anyone else for your trip to Delhi?
Okay. I'm coming too.
What about the venue?
Someone else will take care of it. What are friends for after all?
Just arrange for the tickets.
- Okay. I'll call you. - Okay.
No need to worry about back here. I'll handle everything.
And if Billu bhai gives you something on your way back...
...just get it.
Billu bhai, huh?
Billu bhai.
We've been prospering thanks to you, Diwakar sir.
I'm sending 3 million.
Goodbye.
So...
Hello, sir.
My name's Ajay.
...and need a small investment of 2 million.
If you could arrange for it...
Sir, thank you so much.
I've a couple of plans.
I see... What are these plans?
Well, the first one's the easy way.
...even rob an ATM.
We'll deduct 15% on every robbery that you commit...
...and no interest will be charged.
Sounds nice, sir. It's nice.
- But it's too time-consuming... - White cut.
White...
Sir!
Pull the trigger...bam! Done!
Over!
Then just quit the city.
...to a 5-Star property.
And it's all complimentary.
All on the house.
What clarity he has.
So this one's right.
Cut-to-cut plan. Very simple.
We'll export wherever there's demand.
That's all. Pretty simple. Demand and supply.
Girls...
Doesn't involve much hard work.
You just have to woo daughters of rich fathers.
We'll arrange for the cute hotel.
What say?
All your loans will be paid off.
No... No, sir.
There is something morally wrong about this.
Okay, thank you.
Sir, we'll take the packet, and we'll take your leave.
Okay, bro.
What's the total?
14 minutes, boss.
So 1000 rupees per minute... the total comes to 19,000.
Two cups of tea for 60 each.
You owe me 19900 rupees.
What?
We pay you?
Have it now. You're paying for it, even the biscuits.
We don't want biscuits.
If you prefer broken bones instead...
- ...or like being tossed around... - We'll pay...
- Shera... - We'll pay, sir.
Pay up.
You're right.
What was in that packet?
- Can be anything like weed, hash, LSD? - It's just cocaine.
Throw it. You shouldn't be carrying these things around.
And you were looking at me on the cute-cut plan.
Listen, young man.
We don't have change.
Pay the rickshaw fare, and I'll pay you back.
Bravo.
Fantastic.
Son, where is Shilpa.
Are you here to meet sister Shilpa?
One more brother-in-law.
One more brother-in-law's here. One more brother-in-law's here.
What?
Meaning someone beat you to it, friend.
Sonu, why are you calling him brother-in-law?
Don't you like me?
Actually, we told him his brother-in-law's come to meet his sister.
No, mom, he said so.
No, son. We said we are your sister's friends.
Correct.
And catching up with college friends isn't easy these days.
Yeah.
It's places like this where they meet.
So true.
Right, dad.
No, dad.
Sir, I'll make a move.
Okay, then.
Shilpa,
see Rajat to the door.
You did want some privacy with him.
Okay, son.
Captain.
Sweet boy.
Please, sit.
No, thanks, sir.
Sameer doesn't drink, but I can have one.
Sure...
Sir, I'll help myself.
So who were these people who came to see you?
Captain Rajat.
He didn't come to meet Shilpa.
He came to see her.
Go on.
Sorry.
Each other?
Yes, sir.
I know you want to,
Shilpa's well-educated, she's pretty...
No, sir. That's not it.
We love each other.
Love.
Oh yeah...
Shilpa told me about it.
You're the Zonal head in some multinational company.
No, sir. Actually, my promotion's due in two days.
So...
Come see me after two-days.
Look...
Shilpa's here.
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing, dear.
He's insisting on leaving, and I'm telling him to stay.
Right, Sameer.
Yes...
See your friend to the gate, I'll be inside.
Okay.
It was nice meeting you.
Sure, sir.
Your father.
Guys, I'll just go out for a quick smoke.
Sameer, try to understand.
This is why I was telling you to wait.
I'll meet your dad after I get promoted.
But you...
Till then you can go out with that Rajat.
Give me two days.
I'll come back. Promise.
Yellow shirt.
- Guruji suggested this shirt. - Correct.
Promotions will be announced today. Keep the sweets ready.
Fingers crossed.
All set. All the best.
Ajay, you're back.
Amazing.
Wait...
But you didn't.
What mess were you getting me in?
We're friends after all.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
Aren't you early today?
Sir?
Oh yeah, your dad is not well.
How's your dad doing now?
Aah...
And how much of your startup did you implement in this company?
How many of our clients did you steal for your startup?
Shut up!
Get out of here, now!
- Get out from here! - Sir, please listen to me...
Enough!
How dare you betray the company you work in?
Get out from here!
This company doesn't need you anymore!
Out!
Damnit!
Gautam.
Yeah...
what?
You did this, didn't you?
what?
Did I ask for the client list or you gave it to me?
Hi, everyone.
Hello. Hello.
I know you've been all eagerly waiting for this day.
Everyone's done their best.
But...the one who got promoted...
Okay, I'll tell you.
That name is...
Priyanka Khurana!
'You deserve the best, Sameer.'
'What do you do?'
'Just two more days...after I get promoted.'
'The promotion is yours.'
'Zonal Head.'
'...so I can talk to your dad.'
'Even your dad will feel proud when I tell him.'
You should ask for permission before entering.
Say that again.
You should ask for permission before entering.
Mind your language.
...we finally become engineers, and you guys put us in marketing!
And I got you all the orders!
With my hard work and knowledge!
...even put my personal life at stake!
And who did you promote?
This broad of yours!
What the hell, Sameer?
You'll never wear makeup again.
Have a sweet...
Too much!
I wanted this promotion because I deserve it.
And so do you!
Get out. Get out of the office now.
No...
Don't you get it?
Don't raise your voice.
Get out! Get out!
Say it once more, and I'll kill you.
No... don't touch me! Don't touch me!
"Lord!"
"Lord!"
"Lord!"
You worked pretty hard this year.
Hello.
You know, Bhau, the venue's a hit.
Oh, yeah...your money.
Wait a minute.
Your money.
Here...
Here's your money.
What is this, Bhau?
This is not what I am talking about, Bhau.
I am talking about the money for investment. 2 million rupees.
No...not this year.
We'll think about it next year.
Haven't you eaten?
I even paid 150,000 in advance for the office.
Call the tent guy. Tell him to hurry down here.
Yes, Bhau.
What?
This isn't right, Bhau.
Don't threaten me.
Understood.
Hey handsome, throw him out.
Have you ever earned money yourself?
Takes sweat and grime.
Get lost.
Throw him out.
Out!
"Lord!"
Not to get ripped off.
'When life pins you down...'
'All our hopes and dreams were shattered in a single day.'
You see, the guests must be welcomed with Pan Parag.
Pull up a chair.
Look, son, that's Radhika.
Not Radhika. She's Gitika.
Fine, Gitika.
This is my son.
He's in high school.
Ohh...I am so sorry.
He's an engineer too.
No...
Ask what. There's nothing to ask.
I haven't the slightest clue about these things.
What will you ask?
What's wrong with him?
What are you saying, Ajay?
Nothing. What did I say?
The truth mom.
Let's start at the top.
My name's Ajay.
But I got caught.
Because the guy who was going to invest in my startup...
We do have a loan of 1.6 million.
It's an educational loan...which we can't repay.
For which my father keeps taunting me.
My father wants to see me married...
...so he can repay the loan with the dowry.
By the way, mom, remember those bracelets you made for your daughter-in-law.
I had to pay an advance for my office.
Completely broke.
...and let your daughter be my wife,
then I'll doubt your intelligence.
Ajay!
Enough!
Let it be, he said nothing wrong.
In fact, he told us the truth.
He didn't cheat us.
You might have kept us in the dark and taken dowry.
Let's go.
Come on.
Bye, aunty.
Aunty, I am coming.
Get up.
Get up!
There's the door.
Get out.
Go!
You humiliated me.
...and now you embarrassed me in front of strangers.
You turned me into a dowry-hungry monster!
Drowned yourself or jumped in front of a train...
You won't interfere.
Or you two can live in this house!
And I'll leave instead!
Come on, get out.
Get lost.
And never come back ever!
Throw his stuff out the window.
"I've strayed from my road."
"Show me the way, Lord."
"Dark lanes in my way..."
"...show me a way to live again."
"O, Lord..."
"I had dreamt of making my parents happy at any sake."
"Clueless I was that my dreams would shatter like this."
"My eyes are brimming with tears..."
Pick up the call, damnit!
What about your promotion? I need to talk to my dad!
"O, Lord..."
"Lord..."
It's all over.
It's all bloody over.
Anyone?
Everyone's a bloody capitalist.
That's why we worked so hard.
I worked so hard.
And...
...the girl I loved...
Take care of you.
I couldn't even take care of myself.
And my dad's right!
I am useless!
I am useless about everything!
I...
Let's just die, Sameer.
Let's die.
You know,
But if you're with me,
I won't back down.
You're right.
Let's die.
Let's die.
Sameer.
You didn't jump either.
You two can't do it.
Don't look at me.
You'll break your concentration.
Who told you to interfere between us?
You are interfering. Why don't you jump yourself?
And listen, there are only two reasons to commit suicide.
Which ones yours.
Nothing personal. I am just giving you an idea.
Years ago I came looking here for a job.
When I couldn't find one, I thought I'll jump from here to my death.
But then I started my own business...
...that now yields 600,000 rupees per year.
Well...time to go to work.
Lord...
'That beggar's advice got us completely sober again.'
And die in peace.
No one will know.
Correct.
Good plan.
And why don't we die at 8 am tomorrow?
But why 8?
It's an auspicious time.
What are you saying? Get out of your Guruji's pants.
It's not about the wedding.
Think about it.
If we die on an auspicious time...
Otherwise, we'll be stuck in this fuc***up life.
Sounds right.
'...which was supposed to end at 8 am.'
'But we didn't know that the next event would shake us to the core.'
This is my seat.
Ajay. This one's open. Come on.
Ticket!
Potty.
Ticket! Ticket!
Potty. Potty.
I'm asking for the ticket.
I see...
Finish up, I am waiting.
Ajay.
Mumbai-local ticket.
Mumbai local.
It's out.
Soil it. Come on.
Make it dirtier.
It's my ticket.
Dirty man.
Take it.
Keep it to yourself.
Guys...
Listen...
You don't get it, father.
Farming has no future.
I'll keep sending you money.
Take care.
Goodbye.
Let's go.
What are you thinking? Let's go.
Don't just stand there. It's freezing tonight.
Hurry up.
Make space. Make space.
Here we go. Off we go...
Who's making the air unbearable?
Who's got indigestion.
Let's go.
Babban.
Babban.
Walking on foot again.
Hop on my cab.
Come on.
I won't charge you.
Come on. Come on.
Hop in.
Sameer.
Pay my fare.
This cab doesn't run on water.
It runs on diesel and costs a fortune.
Actually, you jostled us in, before we could say anything...
We are.
Okay, fine. Go.
Go on.
I spare you 20 rupees.
Babban, still sleeping. Go home.
Do you have money to eat or still starving?
Listen, brother.
Keep it.
Get something to eat.
No one's ever given me money with no strings attached.
Yes.
But...why did we take it?
Listen... Listen...
- Sameer! Dogs! - Run! Run!
Run! Faster, Sameer. Faster.
Faster! Faster!
Run! Faster, Sameer. Faster.
Whose dog are they?
Ajay.
We came here to die.
You should join me too. This is amazing, Sameer!
God's finally answered my prayers.
Thank you, God.
What?
There's still time.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't waste time. Just come.
Okay. Okay, I am coming.
Come on.
I feel so like a mermaid.
That was fun!
Lots of fun.
Now I am hungry.
You're bathing, eating, or peeing.
We never agreed on dying of starvation.
We have 20 rupees. Let's give it to someone.
Stop wrestling with him.
How much for one plate?
20 rupees.
20...
But we've only 20 rupees.
Weird guy.
I carry my own audience and don't depend on anyone.
...three of us are here to receive you, we'll go back four buddies.
Were you riding on the engine?
Are you...
Are you talking to us?
Yes. Why?
We know that you're coming from the city and haven't got much time.
How...
...do you know?
Like this!
Since you're our guests, we'll leave no stone unturned in your welcome.
I can't figure out what's going on.
Balwa said two guys are coming to the wedding from the city.
We've to receive them.
You're the guys, the wedding's that way...
...and we're here to pick you up. Let's go.
He's a strange guy.
Are you going to wait here until then?
The wedding formalities have started. Hurry up.
Yes. Let's go.
What is he?
Let's go now, later we'll give them the slip.
Otherwise, he won't stop talking.
My vehicle runs on jet fuel. So fasten your seatbelt.
And Irshad, these guys are a bit underdressed.
Let's go.
Khan sir, spare us.
Let us through.
He's over-educated.
In fact, even he doesn't know how educated he is.
Can't say whether he's really crazy or making us. Come on, guys.
"Had a word with life, took a puff..."
"...and kept walking."
Bravo. Bravo.
The party's already started, uncle.
Them here comes a bomber. I'll smoke everyone up.
Look after them.
"We live life with a smile."
"Amazing. Amazing."
"We live life with a smile."
"Amazing. Amazing."
"Good one, good one."
"Amazing."
"Shake a leg the way you can."
"Like a party-animal."
"Guddu, Pappu, Bittu, Golu, Mintu, Sonu, Vicky..."
"Dance!" "Jhumki, Guddi, Pinky, Chunnu..."
"Do the serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Do the serpent dance."
"Deepak, Raju, Pankaj, Gundan, Champak, Rohit, Chandu..."
"Dance!" "Kajal, Preity, Manju, Meena..."
"Do the serpent dance."
"When the trumpets blare, everyone swings into action."
"Let's play up a storm."
"Mishra, Dubey, Yadav, Shukla, hear me..."
"Khan, Ansari, Kesarwani, Verma, Chaddha, hear me."
Sameer...
"Rahul, Sanjay, Neeraj, Chandan, Akbar, Alim, Ahmed..."
"Do the serpent dance."
You're scared from day 1.
And you're not.
Go die.
You're being impossible.
Because the city was strangling us.
We were stuck with your promotion and my startup.
And the air here is entirely different.
Did anything like this happen with us?
And look at them.
They aren't worried about making a dime.
They are not worrying about the future.
"Pumpum, Lallu, Billu, Veeru, Robert, Chotu.."
"Dance." "Veena, Tina, Poonam, Gita..."
"Do the serpent dance."
"Dance and jump."
I see serenity.
And this is the serenity we were searching for in the city.
Because we took life too seriously...
...and we shouldn't have.
Talking like a wise man now.
What serenity. What a transformation.
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Do the serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Serpent dance."
"Do the serpent dance."
Who will look after us?
Did someone come again?
Yes...
It was those bloody bank people.
See guys,
a farmer's death has become so easy.
Only for 10,000 rupees...
Wear the noose, leave the ground, and he's gone.
Welcome to Karzapur!
"Alarmingly, on an average, eight farmers have committed suicide in the state..."
"Please try again later."
You okay, dear?
Yah...
It's still unavailable.
Will get off your seat and look for him or not?
Prince Charming isn't worried...
...and Queen mother is pacing the entire palace.
Serve lunch.
And you should eat too.
It's too late. Come on.
Don't worry, he'll be back soon.
"But if we look at the previous records..."
"...then you'll be shocked to know.
'So the villagers knew that we were not Balwai's friends.'
'But we had narrated our entire story.'
That's true.
Isn't that wonderful?
"I wish to breathe my last in your arms..."
"...so my death can be memorable."
Who worries about time to commit suicide.
And unwanted guests...
...are treated even better.
Well, Balwai,
you handle the wedding.
I'll handle these guys.
Come on, guys.
We're thinking about staying here...
...with your permission, of course.
We'll do anything.
Pappan, you've already given us clothes to wear.
We're willing to do any job, any job.
Anything at all, huh!
You just have to handle grandma.
Put them up in their bathroom.
Pappan...
Come soon.
You guys won't even let me comb...
What are you staring at?
They look like dacoits.
What treasure have you hidden which they will rob?
I told you they are my friends. From the city.
She's got a little short-circuit in her head.
So call her here.
No guys, my father was a farmer.
He was heavy under debt.
The family began to starve.
Sto one day father romantically went up to my mother and said...
...darling, let's hang till death.
...and I was left with my grandma.
Grandma and Pappan.
Jack squat!
You've been talking for hours now.
You want to hear me sing, and just using them as an excuse.
What song?
Sing anyone you know.
How about your favourite song, sweetheart?
Of course.
Applause.
"Don't be jealous of my beauty..."
What have you done to hide your face?
Frankly speaking, grandma's a sweetheart.
Don't I sing really well?
You sing really well.
Didn't you ever think of going to Mumbai?
Didn't just think...
The sea on one side and the sea of people on the other.
And all that which happened in between.
Because I've a fragile heart.
Pappan, I can't digest one thing.
Let's not talk about the city,
It's getting difficult to even breathe.
And it's so crowded that you try to scratch your head...
...but you end up scratch the next guy.
But they said their arms and legs are still intact.
We'll earn our bread.
Don't even ask.
They are so talented that they can do the impossible.
Pappan...
Sir, we can do anything.
Any job.
Delicate and fragile.
You'll have to be tender here.
This job suits you two.
You two are educated.
Coming. Coming, boss.
Come quickly.
You two go with him and buy farming equipment.
And also check out the shop.
I'll go visit the physician in Bhopal.
He means burning sensations, belching.
Acidity.
Exactly.
- STD... - Yeah...for Acidity.
Imagine, STD.
Dubey sir.
What's the hurry.
Bataule.
Bataule.
Yes, boss.
Here...
...get these items for Gatte.
What about the other one?
Move your hands faster.
Here you go.
How much?
But the MRP is much less.
How can it be 450?
What?
The government gives a subsidy to farmers.
How can you charge us above MRP?
They recently got on this job, friends of Pappan.
Only the government gives subsidies...
...to the villagers.
These are Dubey's rates.
Fine, keep it back.
You know what, you give us a bill for this.
Bill, huh?
Why don't I roast them for you?
Let me tell me.
Every bill has a number...
...and the name of the shop printed on it.
- Correct. - We'll need that bill.
Give me money.
Who are you going with?
My friends. So I need money.
I am talking about this.
Continue.
Weren't you two...
Yes.
Father, he's shying like the bride.
Go where?
Home.
There's a fair too?
Yes...
The fairs here are pretty grand.
See it.
See you, father.
So...what were you saying?
Pay him. What's the bill amount?
Pay him 450 rupees.
- At least the bill... - I remembered something important.
- Gatte, pay him the money. - I know what's so important.
This isn't over yet.
Of course.
So what mischief is cooking on your mind?
Dubey's daughter dropped prince charming a hint.
So promises are meant to be kept.
"Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, fellow members, and germs."
"Watch which way the wind will blow."
"Watch her jump through hoops straight in your heart."
"Watch my Haseena strike you all down."
No, no, no...not here.
"My eyes are like two barrels."
"Fires like a rifle."
"Don't think I am naive."
"...after making tall claims."
Your beauty..."
Your beauty..."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"Your killer attitude..."
"...might take my life."
"Everyone's fallen for your beauty."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"They've all laid their hearts at my feet."
"These men don't give up..."
"...taking false swears."
"But I won't listen..."
"...whether you take me to London or Japan."
Your beauty..."
Your beauty..."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
"You're tip-top."
But you can't repay the bank loan.
I brought my daughter here since she was insisting.
Ramdas uncle.
Rascal...
Show me your underwear. What are you hiding in there?
Young man, are your arms twitching?
Trying to teach me, huh.
Come on, teach me.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Stay back! Back up...
Pappan, they went back.
Leave him alone.
I'll be back in a week.
...you know how we retrieve our money.
Spare them, come on.
Leave please. Go.
- Ramdas. - Bloody goons!
Are you okay?
Who told you to stick your nose in others matters?
You never know when it'll come back to haunt you.
Someone save him.
Save him.
- Stop. Stop. - What happened, aunty?
He isn't opening the door.
Pappan, he isn't opening the door.
What happened, aunty.
This way.
Why you...
Ramdas!
Bring some water.
Settle down.
Drink some water. Drink it.
Are you okay?
Nothing good is happening with them anyway.
I've no field, no crops.
What farmers are we?
Every day waking up
seems like a mammoth task.
No bread on the table every today.
Days go by,
and my hopes keep sinking.
And...
I've to toil like an animal...
...for one square meal.
that we'll have food on the table that day.
What is it?
Every path leads to death.
I've grown tired now.
I am tired.
Father, please don't cry.
I am not hungry. I'll sleep.
Uncle, dying is not a solution.
I can't see them starve every day.
Don't say that.
We cannot live without you.
Even if we've to starve with you.
If he's borrowed a loan, he must return it.
But he isn't refusing on returning the money, sir.
Sir, farmers are committing suicide.
What can I do about it?
I am not telling them to commit suicide.
They keep saying they had no crops this year, no profit...
But since they did, they must pay it back.
Why don't you understand?
He isn't refusing to pay the loan.
Do you know how badly your people roughed up Ramdas?
I'll have you thrown out.
And I'll set your bank on fire!
Listen, mister, be in your limits.
Guard, throw them out.
I'll strangle you with my fingers!
Stay back. Get out.
Fine, we're leaving. Don't get too excited.
- Go out. - I was being polite too.
- Don't get too excited. - Making a scene here.
Don't blame me, Sameer.
Blame him.
We don't know what he'll do next.
We'll deal with it.
Our geese is cooked.
...and helped you out.
But today, these two...
...and especially this one...
He threatened me in my own bank.
The bank has decided...
...then the bank will claim your lands.
Listen, that conversation happened between us...
Even I am only talking, prince charming.
But if you manage to repay the loan in a week...
How is that even possible?
We didn't have a decent crop in six-months.
That's not my problem. I am leaving now.
And the farmers had a setback.
You have these two to help you out.
Take their help and repay the loan.
I am leaving.
Manager sir. Listen to us.
Ajay, who told you to go and fight with him?
We didn't go there to fight, Kishan. We went there to talk too.
Quiet!
Not a word.
Aren't you the guy who came to my shop and was arguing with me?
It's in his nature.
Believe me.
He must have abused the bank manager.
I can assure you.
Now we've a new problem on our hands.
How do we get rid of this problem now?
He sent his recovery agents who were beating up Ramdas at the fair.
Shut up. Beating up Ramdas.
Pappan, what diabolical duo did you bring to the village?
They have ruined this village.
Dubey sir, I am talking to them.
Look, son, things have gotten out of hand.
Things might have gotten out of hand, but we also have six months.
What can we do in 6-months?
Farm, huh!
Do we need your permission now to work in our fields?
There's no point in getting disappointed like this, sir.
Wait a minute, You don't have to interfere!
Just an uninvited guests.
All you can do is fight.
I know your young body's itching to fight.
How dare these people enter our village?
Throw them out!
Calm down. Calm down.
I won't do it alone. We're all going to do it.
A person is capable of doing anything.
If we're capable of anything, then I'll become the Prime Minister of this country!
Heard what the village-chief said?
If growing crops was their way out...
Pappan, did these two loot a bank?
You rebelled too soon, man. Before required.
Can I say something?
Seeds and fertilisers will be arranged for.
How?
My father.
He sells them at expensive rates and saves up on the seeds and fertilisers.
That way.
Your father is a big miser, Jhumki. Don't be offended.
Who is going to tell him?
Take all you want.
Great.
What a fruitful discussion we're having?
We're going to steal now.
I know you can do it.
Sameer.
This is not a professional discussion either.
Everything is personal here.
Don't you see your startup here?
We came here to die!
Came here to die?
Nothing, he's just bantering.
Tell her.
Tell her...we came here to commit suicide.
Suicide?
Let's do one thing.
You can jump in one of the wells in this village and die.
There's well behind our house as well.
Be quiet, grandma.
What's all this talk about dying?
Then let's do one thing...
And run from pillar to post in the city like us!
I am trying to find a solution to a problem...
And if you don't want to do it, then just spare me.
You're not the only one who cares about everyone's pain!
Do it on my own.
You tried talking to the manager on your own!
And even to the villagers.
You need a man like me even to die.
Ajay...
You're unlucky for yourself.
Go away.
So now I am bad luck,
Yes, you're bad luck.
You know what, from now on continue with your life without this bad luck.
- I will. - Now leave.
Ajay...
Pappan...one of them got away with the loot.
The other one will leave too.
So mister, do you have any money today or not?
And where's your friend?
Have mercy on us.
Ask those two boys to be merciful to you.
There's nothing I can do.
Now leave.
I said leave.
Hello.
Hello, chief.
- But please hear me out... - We don't need your apology.
- Go away. - Sir...
Go away. Get lost.
Get lost.
We're already in a lot of trouble. And he's trying to teach us.
Farm...
Here...
You've to work for the village.
If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.
Okay.
There must be a reason why God saved us from dying.
There has to be.
Well, only His will is important.
But the question is what is His will?
That other thief stole my money.
Why didn't you stop that thief?
I can't go explaining to everyone.
Then tell him to go drown himself in the lake.
The entire village is pretty emotional.
The villagers won't understand until he doesn't die.
Say that again.
Oh, God.
Stop jostling her.
Or she'll get furious.
Right, emotions. She said emotions.
It's all about emotions.
Grandma, you gave me a wonderful idea, darling.
I didn't give him anything, Pappan.
He is lying.
Take his clothes off and frisk him.
I can even take my clothes off for you, grandma.
Let's go, Pappan.
I'll strip him naked.
No, no, no.
What are you saying?
I can't do it, Ajay.
Kishan, you're going back on your words.
But this is about life and death.
What if something goes wrong?
Just be gentle.
Just tell me when do I enter.
Please say yes, brother Kishan. This concerns the entire village.
- He said yes! - Great. Great.
He has made plans to kill everyone in the village.
We'll hang him instead.
But we won't spare him.
Kishan... Kishan... what are you saying?
Take me back down.
Please help him.
Is he really hanging him?
No. Let me go.
Why are they hanging him?
Kishanlal's doing the right thing.
Come on.
Give me one chance to talk to the villagers.
Shut up. Rascal. Wants to apologise now!
You didn't leave any options for the villagers.
Check whether the rope's strong or not.
Don't look at me. Check the rope.
Hold him tight.
The rope's here.
Jhumki, please explain to your father.
Kishanlal.
Hang him upside down. And check his weight.
Pull!
What cruelty is this?
He's strung my friend up.
Pappan, save me.
Look what they did to me.
I beg you.
Release him.
Look, Pappan, this concerns the entire village.
Village-chief, give him the orders. Stop him.
But if you don't want to hear, then let me die.
- Pull the rope. - Trying to teach us.
You're the root of all their problems!
Because I know the root of your problems.
Shut up! Pull the rope.
People are already dying in the village...
...why is still Kishanlal is hanging him.
Jhumki is right. Let's listen to what he has to say.
Kishan, let's hear what he has to say.
Kishan, we're not the kind of people to kill someone.
Let's hear him first.
Yes...
Honestly speaking, the biggest problem of this village is...
...that all the youngsters ran off to the city
in search of jobs.
How can these old people grow crops?
Second problem...
Do you?
Making such tall claims after putting the village in trouble.
I am not making tall claims, Kishan.
I am making a small point.
or the government isn't aiding him.
The biggest problem is yield.
Nearly 900 kilos on one hectare of land.
900 kilos.
Did your eyes open now?
3000 kilos.
Imagine if you can grow 3000 kilos in a single hectare...
...then would you need any government aid.
No!
Land!
Land?
We all farm on our lands.
What good did that do?
And it never will, village chief.
And you can watch the outcome.
That's all.
Hear that.
Now, he's also become our leader.
No one's going to listen to you.
Who will provide us with that for a big piece of land?
Jhumki. I think you had something to say.
My father will provide everything.
Seeds, fertilisers, pesticides at half the rate.
Father who?
Now look, Dubey sir has promised to give us seeds and fertilisers. Okay.
Dubey sir will die if I'm lying.
The boy sounds right.
And I can't grow crops in this age.
I am giving him my land.
Thanks, bro.
Are you going to grow missiles on your land?
- Say yes. - No...
Everyone will have to give their piece of land.
Because one needs all five fingers to make a closed fist.
Why isn't anyone raising their hands?
You know what,
And I was saying, what's wrong if he stays alive?
Meaning...
...there's no task in this world that you can't do.
This...
I used to read this book on economics.
You won't understand his words.
Because you've grown used to this.
But if you don't listen to him today...
It's all in this book.
What was he saying?
Seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, tractor, oil...
One land, one expense.
One land, less expense.
What is my expense?
No cigarette causes cancer. I quit.
Kill him.
Run away. Run away. Run away.
Run away. Don't stay here.
Run away. Run away.
Ramayan, huh!
The bloody city boy...
...been here only a week.
And you've turned him into a God.
Great.
You're saying it yourself.
Listen to me carefully.
Go and tell them...
I won't sell my goods without profit.
And listen to me carefully...
But I can't stand it anymore.
I will support that boy. Stop me if you can.
I am your father.
Stop me if you can, huh.
I'll show you.
this man's brought up a crucial point.
All the youngsters of the village ran off to the city.
And he's right.
So he asks who is going to work in the fields.
...that the women of this village might be orthodox,
but can equal any man in any job.
So...who is with me.
- Listen... - What happened?
You guys are celebrating here while Dubey has made a mess of things.
We'll have to stop him before he wins in his plan.
Village-chief, I was telling you...
These two boys are a piece of s***
Good for nothing.
Where's your other friend?
Why didn't you run too?
For this girl?
Father!
You guys gave him your lands.
Okay.
Even if I don't count my profit...
Where will the money come from?
Ajay, do you have an answer?
Ajay...
...haven't you thought about it?
Well, I don't have an answer...
This isn't the land of gold.
At least 300,000 rupees.
Hear that?
This vehicle here... is worth 60,000.
Anyone will take it for 40,000.
Pappan, you don't even have any land?
Why are you contributing?
Then why is he giving it his all?
That's nonsense.
I won't take any profit.
The village's reputation comes first, understand.
The truth is, who will pay for the purchases.
Tell me.
Tell me, Ajay.
See...
And
who's going to work?
These old folks...
Great.
Anyone.
Anybody?
Anyone.
Anyone.
I don't know about you guys,
We'll do the work.
But you didn't understand.
No, I...
And how?
Just like you always do.
We'll have to make an outline.
You know that every startup needs an initial investment.
For our startup.
My honeymoon jumped off the bridge that day.
And you were right.
Astrology never does anyone any good.
So Dubey...
Jhumki.
Don't get her wrong.
She's been my sound support.
Even went against her father for us.
This is all I've left to do.
No, no, Pappan. Come here.
Start it.
It's working again.
"My country..."
"Every day is a new beginning."
"Dwells in every heart."
"The name of my country alone does wonders."
"The name of my country alone does wonders."
"From the fields to the borders..."
"...from city to villages say in one synch."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
Like how much water's required, which fertiliser to be used...
...and which pesticide to be used.
Where do we get the best fertiliser?
From cow-dung
We must collect all the dung in this village.
But it takes ages to turn dung into fertiliser, son.
Then who will do it?
The entire village's sitting on one side...leaving me alone.
Here.
Keys to my storehouse.
Take whatever you need.
Man...even my brain's tired.
You've put on weight.
What? Put on weight.
Do you know what city girls do to stay fit?
"I've to grow dreams in this soil."
"Turn it to gold with my hard work."
"We've to repay the debt of this land."
"We've to make it the best in the world."
"These words are written on the waves of Ganga and Jamuna."
Now listen, water is important for our crops...
...but excess water can turn our crops yellow.
This is Nano Ganesh.
It runs on mobile network.
It's a difficult task in small lands.
But it will take forever to look for worms and dead grass in this big land.
Plus we'll be ruining the crops.
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
So how much do you have?
Kishan, this is not your battle.
Go Ramdas.
You must have shut down the weighing scale.
What?
I see.
What else?
We won't sell at this rate.
This is how the market fixes rate, Ajay.
Hurry up. What do you want to do with it?
It's not your decision alone, Ramdas.
It's all the farmer.
Speak louder.
Don't go back home and hang yourself.
If anyone pays you more in this market,
Let's not aggravate things.
We can't be weak now, Kishan.
Clear it out of here.
It's Sharbati wheat. I've checked. The best quality
I see...
Listen...
Even if you take this wheat back, it will rot.
For your best interest, understand.
Tell me one thing.
When you buy something from the market...
Anything, like shoes, clothes, mobile...
...who decides the rate?
So who will fix the rate of this crop which this farmer grew?
You or the farmers?
One price... That's the market rate.
Have you lost your mind?
Let's go, uncle.
I won't give a penny.
Think about it.
Leave it. Leave it.
'The villagers believed that we should've sold the wheat at the market.'
'...they wouldn't have made enough to pay off their debts.'
'Sameer and I were steadfast on our decision,
but on the inside, we were worried too.'
'The villagers were upset too.'
So this wasn't the end of the story.
Thunderous applause for Sameer and Ajay.
On this show, we present success stories, of people...
Gave it a new meaning.
Their success story has reached an interesting twist.
This saga of success will continue, but it is time for a short commercial break.
Ajay.
Otherwise, you would've never seen our faces.
No, papa, you didn't make a mistake.
No one made any mistakes.
I guess it was a bad phase, papa.
Mister, your shot's ready.
One minute...
...and we're hearing the success stories of Sameer and Ajay.
So what happened next.
We'll have to sell this wheat at the market.
When you're clinging on to hope, then hold on tight.
We made it so far. We'll find a way.
I know...
Come on.
Come on.
Sir, the other day you asked me what I do.
I am a businessman.
Really?
I am the manufacturer of the commodity that you export.
Sir, here are the samples.
Thank you.
Have a look.
What do you think?
No agents.
Because...
I only do business with people I know.
Shilpa said no to Rajat.
But if you want to seal this deal,
So sir, are we going to drink wine today?
Wine?
Champagne, it is.
'Sameer got Shilpa without any auspicious timing...'
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you know that our country comes second in the world...
Why?
Why?
...of the farmer of our country practise collective farming.
he can increase the quality of their yield to international standard.
When the farmers of our country become self-reliant...
Thank you. Thank you.
With our family.
One more thing.
The soil of our country can still yield gold.
We just need to love it.
Lovely.
"Keep raining on the fields like the monsoon."
"Spread your fragrance all over the country."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"We've to repay the debt of this land."
"These words are written on the waves of Ganga and Jamuna."
"From the fields to the borders..."
"...from city to villages say in one synch."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."
"The soil of my country yields gold and diamonds."

﻿Forget it. Next time.
﻿After New Year’s Day,
﻿Are you really divorcing?
﻿Yes.
﻿the last time you got drunk.
﻿I’m divorcing for dignity.
﻿Who is this woman?
﻿You know you're cheating?
﻿How is that called cheating?
﻿so you act like a dog out there?
﻿That's too harsh.
﻿What have I done?
﻿Her high heel fell off.
﻿Her high heel?
﻿Fell off again?
﻿And this one?
﻿Then you should thank me.
﻿ Hey!
﻿Thank you!
﻿So, did Teddy
﻿ really cheat?
﻿Of course noL
﻿He’s just a social butterfly
﻿After I left.
﻿she found she was still streaming.
﻿she played the victim and
﻿fanned the flame,
﻿They cursed the shit out of me.
﻿Who's calling? Why didn't you answer?
﻿Who cares? I don't have to.
﻿No.
﻿Those guys just got the wrong person.
﻿Don’t worry. I'm totally fine.
﻿Oh! Oh crap!
﻿Recently, we call for works of picture books externally.
﻿Let me know if it's good.
﻿This story
﻿ is about a robot boy
﻿who got the power to make wishes.
﻿ in his own heart.
﻿And one day
﻿he gives all he has
﻿but is only able to restart his story.
﻿Here is my point.
﻿ Kind of.
﻿So I personally think
﻿we can contact this person
﻿I'm free now. Just come.
﻿Let me see.
﻿I'll meet him and have a talk.
﻿Why? Are you competing?
﻿Hello.
﻿hi, everyone!
﻿She is han Shuyan.
﻿Look at the five cakes.
﻿You know, her backery
﻿It's drawn very well to me.
﻿the story itself?
﻿A story with no end
﻿indicates there are  many things hard to change.
﻿It's inevitable.
﻿Thanks for all your efforts this year.
﻿and to celebrate
﻿our official cooperation with Bai Cha,
﻿Whoever comes will get one!
﻿Bravo! Thank you. boss!
﻿I know.
﻿Whenever we have a party,
﻿you'll find an excuse to skip out.
﻿And you'll be the first one  to work overtime.
﻿You can’t skip out.
﻿my girlfriend wants to celebrate with me.
﻿Look, you stick with your girlfriend every day.
﻿You got plenty of time to spare, right?
﻿Hi, Mom.
﻿I saw the live stream.
﻿Happy New Year, Mr. Wang!
﻿Happy New Year!
﻿ weird words that
﻿I don't understand.
﻿But I think we can talk about it.
﻿Yes, we can.
﻿Drink less.
﻿Excuse me.
﻿Hey, Yuxuan.
﻿Hello, Shuyan.
﻿Yuxuan is not going back tonight.
﻿Hey!
﻿Come and celebrate the New Year with us.
﻿I’ll call you a car.
﻿Hello? Hello?
﻿Dude, it’s New Year's Eve!
﻿We should eat and drink together
﻿and make some noise!
﻿It’s dangerous alone at night.
﻿You're not her dad.
﻿Hello?
﻿Party time!
﻿Lets’ get drunk!
﻿Yuxuan.
﻿ Mr. Wang.
﻿I heard your girlfriend is coming.
﻿Yes Teddy urged her to come.
﻿I'm telling you,
﻿you took design orders privately,
﻿Yet, you asked for a six-month advance on your salary.
﻿I discussed it with the accountant  this afternoon.
﻿We have no precedent for that.
﻿ I really can't help it.
﻿Mr. Wang, I...
﻿What is it?
﻿Yes? Who's calling? Excuse me.
﻿Come in. Let's talk inside.
﻿You need a six-month advance on your salary?
﻿ We're saving for it together.
﻿Don't listen to Wang.
﻿ Stop lying to me.
﻿Yuxuan, did something bad happen?
﻿Don’t worry.
﻿ Let's go home.
﻿We'll talk at home.
﻿longer and longer.
﻿Yuxuan, what on earth happened?
﻿ you make me so insecure now?
﻿Come. Come here.
﻿Come here.
﻿Before my father died,
﻿Now they force me to pay back the debt.
﻿Am I clear?
﻿Can't we face it together?
﻿Yeah! Why not?
﻿Now I can’t afford a property we want to live in.
﻿I can’t give you your ideal wedding.
﻿I can't even take care of myself,
﻿let alone you.
﻿Sometimes I think
﻿I don’t love you for what you said.
﻿But I never thought
﻿you would leave me so easily.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan!
﻿ Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Let me explain, Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan!
﻿Shuyan!
﻿I don't love you for what you said.
﻿Mrs. Han.
﻿Shuyan is gone.
﻿I'm sorry.
﻿Officially the first day  we're together. I'm a bit shy.
﻿Let's do our best.
﻿Today's my birthday.
﻿Let me celebrate with you, okay?
﻿You didn't tell your mom about you making cakes.
﻿ But I never thought
﻿you would leave me so easily.
﻿I was freaked out.
﻿So good you’re here.
﻿I’m always here.
﻿You're just too tired.
﻿Let's celebrate your birthday this evening.
﻿Sure.
﻿Coming! Right away!
﻿Sorry, Yuxuan.
﻿It’s all right.
﻿Fine. Let me hold this.
﻿Okay.
﻿How about you come back earlier?
﻿No. So, which movie?
﻿Any will do. Go ahead.
﻿
﻿Be careful
﻿Master Gu, another day of sweet driving, huh?
﻿Bye.
﻿
﻿Thanks.
﻿Hold it!
﻿What is it?
﻿Thank you.
﻿I deserve it.
﻿Maybe, what will happen
﻿it's inevitable.
﻿Recently, we call for
﻿works of picture books externally.
﻿This is...
﻿one of the works we have received.
﻿I'm sorry.
﻿ Although I submitted this,
﻿I still wish to
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Are you done?
﻿Yeah. I’m done.
﻿Let's go, then.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿You kept telling me about
﻿Let's go there today.
﻿It's all right.
﻿we can still get some umbrellas here.
﻿Then it'll be an outdoor cafe.
﻿Good.
﻿If we have enough budget,
﻿how about planting it here?
﻿Will do.
﻿and here
﻿we can put up a blackboard
﻿to show costumes
﻿the limited cake of the day.
﻿Yeah...this is it.
﻿the day's fresh cakes as they come in.
﻿Sure.
﻿Yeah.
﻿If we really rent this place,
﻿ it needs proper renovations.
﻿Yuxuan.
﻿Yuxuan?
﻿Yuxuan!
﻿Shall we celebrate it at home this evening?
﻿Okay.
﻿ Look. How is it?
﻿Good. Let me revise.
﻿Okay.
Hello?
﻿I saw the live stream.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿After we finish the meal,
﻿Well work it out together.
﻿ She doesn't. But I do.
﻿I know you best.
﻿Yeah. I know.
﻿Why did you skip class?
﻿No. I didn't.
﻿ How dare you lie? Did you lie?
﻿Stop it!
﻿ You're lying to me?
﻿Stop it!
﻿Don't hit me!
Stop!
﻿Are you running?
﻿Stop right there!
﻿Who are you?
﻿What are you doing?
﻿Now. Tell me!
﻿Where did you go?
﻿Your mom ran away with that man.
﻿Yuxuan.Yuxuan!
﻿Piss off!
﻿Follow her example, huh?
﻿Shuyan! Shuyan!
﻿Don't think about it!
﻿Come home with me!
﻿Let me go!
﻿Come here!
﻿Yuxuan! Gu Yuxuan!
﻿Stop!
﻿No matter what,
﻿You can call the police to solve a problem
﻿I understand.
﻿Officer,
﻿Shuyan is in danger.
﻿She's in danger.
﻿Officer.
﻿Let me out.
﻿Wait for the results.
﻿You can't keep me here!
﻿She's really in danger now!
﻿Sit down!
﻿Calm down.
﻿You can only cooperate with us so that
﻿you can be released after we put things together.
﻿Go ahead.
﻿Can I go now?
﻿Yes, after you sign it.
﻿the man did use family violence.
﻿and doesn’t need the police to handle it.
﻿Good-bye.
﻿Sorry! The subscriber you dialed  cannot be connected for the moment.
﻿You are Shuyan's emergency contact.
﻿She’s now in a car accident on Huaxi Road.
﻿Please come immediately.
﻿How soon can you get her out?
﻿She's almost gone.
﻿Give me another 15 minutes.
﻿I am you,
﻿lonely old you in later years.
﻿So I need you to remember
﻿the only thing you can do now
﻿is to make the most of the rest of your time
﻿and cherish whatever you have.
﻿Shuyan!
﻿What are you doing?
﻿You can't get in!
﻿Let me through!
﻿Back off! Back off!
﻿Don't obstruct law enforcement!
﻿Let me through!
﻿I'm warning you. Don’t obstruct law enforcement!
﻿I only have a wish.
﻿Please let Shuyan come back to me.
﻿No.
﻿Yeah.
﻿No?
﻿You just stay in.
﻿What’s wrong with you today?
﻿I’m taking the day off.
﻿ You look a bit weird today.
﻿I sent you the revised design.
﻿Take a look.
﻿I got something important to do.
﻿Give me your bag.
﻿Get up.
﻿Yuxuan.Yuxuan?
﻿Yuxuan. Yuxuan?
﻿It’s green.
﻿Let's choose the movie later.
﻿Master Gu, another day of sweet driving, huh?
﻿Wait for me here after you’re done.
﻿just in case...
﻿What?
﻿Nothing.
﻿See yo later.
﻿Showing off so early in the morning?
﻿See you later.
﻿Okay. Okay.
﻿Bye.
﻿See you, Mr. Bai Cha.
﻿I have something important to tell you.
﻿Okay, sweethearts.
﻿See you next time.
﻿Bye.
﻿I'm done.
﻿What are ydu drawing?
﻿We are opening a bakery,
﻿so I've drawn he facade.
﻿Have a look.
﻿Really?
﻿Oh! Here is Master Gu again.
﻿ showing off your love.
﻿I can't stand it.
﻿ Wait.
﻿ I'll show you something.
﻿After you see it, then consider
﻿ whether you’re divorcing Teddy.
﻿Why must you...
Why must you divorce me?
﻿We... We can talk.
﻿You know him.
﻿No, I can't admit defeat....
﻿and so special to me.
﻿Marry me.
﻿Marry me again.
﻿I know.
﻿But I can't text her
﻿because she blocked me.
﻿Are we really coming to my house?
﻿Shuyan, I’m here with you.
﻿Hello, Mom.
﻿I saw the live stream.
﻿But now she ia cake baker.
﻿How can I be happy?
﻿Yes. I lied to you,
﻿to see what on earth she wants to be.
﻿Mom, you haven't eaten the cake I make.
﻿Seeing them eat my cakes
﻿ and feel happy,
﻿also feel happy in my heart.
﻿It's a career that  I've been following through with love.
Mrs. Han Shuyan told me
﻿ you love strawberries.
﻿ So today she particularly made
﻿Mom try it.
﻿Mom, just try it.
﻿I made this cake.
﻿Take a bite. Take a bite.
﻿If you say nothing, it's good.
﻿Really?
﻿So, if you take the leap bravely,
﻿you'll find things are not that difficult. Right?
﻿I’ve sold this house.
﻿to build a new house.
﻿Before it's torn down,
﻿Before my father died,
﻿he invested with someone
﻿and got cheated.
﻿That’s why I sold this house
﻿to pay back.
﻿Didn't he ask you before making decisions?
﻿Before he died,
﻿we hadn’t talked for a long time.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Do you remember the box
﻿Yes,I do.
﻿She was already very sick then.
﻿ But, to make me happy...
What's your wish?
﻿Of course.
﻿Mom has prepared it just for you.
﻿And then she left us.
﻿Every time he sobered up,
﻿ promise he wouldn't do it again.
﻿But he didn't keep it once.
So you said no one else
﻿but me had celebrated your birthday.
﻿From now on, we will celebrate your
﻿every birthday together.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿These days I’ve been having the same dream.
﻿In this dream,
﻿every time I lit a candle,
﻿Including the first time,
﻿Yuxuan, what’s this place?
﻿you'll see soon.
﻿Wait here for a while.
﻿Okay.
﻿Lend me your boyfriend.
﻿what?
﻿Just for a while.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Why are you...?
﻿Hey, I'll take you to a good place for fun.
﻿Let's go now.
﻿Wait. But he...
﻿Wait for what? Just go!
﻿Don't be curious.
﻿Just follow me.
﻿Olivia.
﻿Olivia.
﻿Olivia!
﻿Well, it’s...?
﻿to do for me.
﻿Thank you.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿ I feel I’m especially lucky
﻿at Teddy and Olivia's wedding.
﻿I'm a sweet tooth,
﻿Thank you
﻿and teaching me how to love.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿I wish to love you with my life.
﻿no matter what happens in the future,
﻿and will never leave you.
﻿I love you.
﻿I...I'm sorry
﻿ for giving you a downhill marriage.
﻿It’s not there yet.
﻿ Sorry.
﻿Yuxuan
﻿Have you ever thought
﻿would be like?
﻿A simple one, I guess.
﻿an over-the-top wedding like
﻿Olivia and Teddy's.
﻿It's up to you.
﻿When we open our bakery one day,
﻿and keep a dog?
﻿so they can be companions.
﻿Okay.
﻿Yuxuan.
﻿Thank you
﻿I’m really happy today.
﻿our love in this life
﻿Same here.
﻿Let’s go. We'll go home and  celebrate your birthday.
﻿Shuyan!
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan, wake up.
﻿Mom is here.
﻿Mom.
﻿Go call the doctor.
﻿Okay...
﻿Where am I?
﻿Don't you remember?
﻿Mom. Mom.
﻿Where’s Yuxuan?
﻿ Girl. Calm down.
﻿I'll tell you.
﻿For saving you,
﻿ Where's Yuxuan?
﻿Where's Yuxuan?
﻿Don't move.
﻿Where's Yuxuan?
﻿Babe. Stay still. Stay still.
﻿Mom. Where's he?
﻿Shuyan.
﻿You go home first.
﻿Here's another thing  I want you to understand.
﻿If I can’t be with Shuyan
﻿for a while,
﻿She doesn’t eat spicy food now
﻿lest it could affect her taste  in making cakes.
﻿When she's unhappy,
﻿she'll drink a cup of hot chocolate,
﻿No, I'm fine.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿Shuyan.
﻿But you must pull yourself together.
﻿So Yuxuan got caught in the reversal
﻿of time for making the wish?
﻿So the candles can really reverse time,
﻿right?
﻿I have no candle now.
﻿I don't know whether I can save Shuyan.
﻿How?
﻿Here's all my property information
﻿and bank cards.
﻿When the time comes,
﻿please help me solve this one with the money.
﻿Why?
﻿You can do it yourself.
﻿So...
﻿Yuxuan has been ready
﻿ for saving my life.
﻿author lives?
﻿ Sorry. I’m mistaken.
﻿Come in.
﻿Perhaps you could temporarily
﻿change the experience of others.
﻿In this dream,
﻿I kept trying to change a thing.
﻿But I didn't make it at last.
﻿What did you try to change?
﻿ I tried to change someone’s fate.
﻿If Yuxuan died in my place,
﻿ then it means fate is changeable.
﻿There must be a way.
﻿You...
﻿Have you wondered what it would cost you?
﻿And the candles
﻿won’t start over with the reversal of time.
﻿Nothing.
﻿The candles
﻿have run out.
﻿only two are left.
﻿ Every time I lit a candle,
﻿Including the first time,
﻿ Once I was like you,
﻿I wanted to change everything.
﻿Yes. You still keep it.
﻿The candles
﻿No.
﻿What are you doing?
﻿It's my boyfriend's house.
﻿I need to get in to find something.
﻿ All is taken down in there!
﻿Keep out, miss!
﻿Hey, you...
﻿All is taken down!
﻿Miss.
﻿Miss.
﻿ Open the door, miss! - Yes.
Please! Get Yuxuan back!
﻿No! Don't?
﻿Sit Please!
﻿Get Yuxuan back.
﻿ No!
﻿If Yuxuan died in my place,
﻿then it means fate is changeable.
﻿There must be a way.
Have you wondered what it would cost you?
﻿:Are you not coming
﻿If Yuxuan could
﻿ keep living in this world,
﻿I’d rather...
﻿I'd rather...
﻿We never...
And we...
﻿ never loved.
﻿Yes?
﻿What's taking you so long?
﻿Aren't you married?
﻿What's the nonsense?
﻿Come here soon.
﻿Are you insane?
﻿ 2018.
﻿2018?
﻿Yuxuan.
﻿Hey man!
﻿ Teddy looks so smart today.
﻿So do you. You look good.
﻿The vibes are perfect!
﻿Teddy, where's Gu Yuxuan?
﻿Where's he?
﻿His plane is late.
﻿K5ES7 I'm stumped.
﻿No.
﻿Teddy, One more is needed here...
﻿What’s needed?
﻿The bill, please.
﻿-I am. -I am.
﻿Yeah.
﻿Later we gradually understand.
﻿ After the time is reversed,
﻿I can't see Yuxuan again.
﻿Sorry.
﻿Please check it and dial again.
﻿After I understand this,
﻿If I insist on meeting him,
﻿will there be another accident?
﻿So I begin to learn how to live on my own
﻿and get used to it.
﻿But sometimes I still want to know
﻿he is fine
﻿without me.
﻿ Mom, I’m back.
-Hello. - Here's the deal.
﻿I'm here to promote the anti-fraud application.
﻿and get cheated at last.
﻿We got many cases like that.
﻿I promise you.
﻿It's really a fraud.
﻿A fraud?
﻿Then you should thank me.
﻿Hell yeah!
﻿Come here, you guys.
﻿Hi, everyone.
﻿of Olivia and Teddy?
﻿When Yuxuan's dad died.
﻿it must be really tough for him.
﻿But I can't.
﻿There’s only one thing I can do for him.
﻿Happy birthday!
﻿Happy New Year!
﻿CAKE SHOP
﻿LAKE SHOP
﻿Welcome!
﻿Hello.
﻿on the poster at the door?
﻿Yes.
﻿Just... wait a second.
﻿No problem.
﻿I can wait.
﻿Nope.
﻿It’s a rabbit.
﻿It's snowing.
﻿will show up.
﻿Here.
﻿Thank you.
A few years after An Lushan rebelled against the Tang
the dynasty's western borders lay undefended.
The Tubos went on the warpath.
Late winter, the first year of Emperor Daizong's reign.
Governor Gao!
Abandon the fort.
Retreat to Lushui Pass.
Governor Gao!
The Emperor has fled the capital?
Yes.
His Majesty is in Shanzhou.
The Tubos have besieged Chang'an.
Marshal Guo Ziyi's army -
where are they?
Still in Lantian.
More ministers and generals have been executed.
His Majesty is resolute.
As soon as he took the throne
he executed Li Fuguo and Chancellor Yuan.
These are turbulent times.
The court has sent a flurry of orders
urging Your Excellency to lead your army
to attack the Tubo troops in the west -
and lift the siege of Chang'an.
and retreated to Lushui Pass
General Yan Wu will soon take over
But
when the court assigns blame
I'll be the guilty one.
Bring the Tubo prisoner for interrogation.
You must answer truthfully.
Reporting!
Governor -
dozens of cavalry are at the camp gates.
It's extremely urgent.
Says he's an Imperial Envoy, Military Inspector.
Military inspector?
Imperial Envoy?!
Go to the gates.
Receive them courteously.
Yes sir.
It's Heaven's Will!
Take the Tubo away.
Yes sir.
Get up! Move!
Governor Gao!
Governor!
Inspector Cheng.
For not riding out to greet you
I apologise.
The Emperor sent me west
to ask you some questions, sir.
If you cover up anything, sir
or are less than clear
I am authorized
Ask, sir,
and I'll say all I know.
Li Bai.
Li Bai. Li Taibai.
Imperial Scholar.
Calls himself Green Lotus Hermit.
Li Bai.
You're not here about the Tubos?
How did you meet Li Bai?
Start from the beginning.
He was...
he was once my good friend.
from His Majesty down to peddlars.
Don't fear loneliness on the road ahead
For who in this world doesn't know you?
I've heard that poem before.
I wrote it when I was thirty.
as a farewell to Dong Da.
I was so young and ignorant!
Even if everyone knows you
how many count as true friends?
So if Li Bai was once your true friend,
Governor!
We met when we were young.
I was twenty.
It was near Dongting Lake.
When he tried to kill me.
I'm from the Gao clan of Bohai.
The 35th boy in my generation.
They called me "Gao Thirty-Five".
and made Prince of Bohai.
My father had great expectations of me.
He hoped that one day
Confucius said
"To practice what you learn -"
But learning to read
was really difficult for me.
When I looked at a book
the characters swam on the page like tadpoles.
Father -
F-forgive me.
My father was a warrior-scholar.
But when he died, in Shao, Guangdong,
I was sixteen. My mother had long passed away.
I took his ashes from Guangdong back to Guangling.
I came home to an empty house.
After three years of mourning
didn't read well but I had martial skills.
It was Kai yuan, the Tang's Golden Age.
I would go straight to Chang'an,
serve the Emperor,
and restore the glory of my family.
I rode west from Guangling.
I'd only reached Dongting Lake
and my money was running out.
Thief!
Stop!
Damn thief. You're skilled.
But you're no hero up on that horse.
If you're a true fighter, dismount.
We'll see who wins then!
You steal my horse and bags and you're no thief?
You're good at this, thief.
To block my sword isn't easy.
But with such skill, why thieve?
They had saddlebags.
If you're not a thief
Oh! A c-coincidence.
Okay, I believe you!
Lend me your horse!
My horse!
You're quite the warrior.
Thank you for saving me.
Earlier, I falsely accused you.
I beg your pardon.
No n-need to apologise.
The law of the Tang
says if a civilian meets a thief
killing him isn't a crime.
Otherwise, I couldn't have helped you.
So young, and yet so formal.
Thank you.
Gao Shi, at yours.
If I didn't catch them, I'd never forgive myself.
What you're carrying - it's valuable?
But this -
This is...?
We studied together in our youth.
After I left Sichuan I ran into him at Mt Lu.
We looked for a Taoist master together.
But fate was cruel.
Three years ago, he took ill and died.
and bury him there.
That's right!
I'll bury him by Yellow Crane Tower.
Let that famous tower be his companion.
A marvelous idea, right?
Come, Brother Gao -
He said his family was from Longxi.
He used to live in Sichuan
in the hope one would recognise his talent
and commend him to the court
Enjoy!
Brother Gao -
we've got time.
How you killed that thief with your spear -
I'd be happy
Let's do it.
and rely on variation.
is to trick your opponent.
Gao Shi -
When I was eighteen
I went to Mt. Changping
to study strategy with a Master Zhao.
There's a North Sea fish
That's called the Kun.
that's called the Eagle.
Li Bai.
He lived in this world
but seemed apart from it as well.
Got it!
Brother Gao -
living in such a golden age as this
we shall be Great Eagles!
and perch upon the jujube tree.
steals the life of a good man.
The Great Eagle never spread its wings -
O grief! O sorrow!
Brother Wu -
O grief!
O sorrow!
Brother Gao -
Blink and it's gone.
So tragic.
Brother Li -
Brother Gao -
nothing in life is easy.
I want to do the hardest things.
One day
But before I can do that
I must achieve official rank.
Brother Gao -
Of course.
This governor loves essays.
I wrote "Ode to the Great Eagle" for him.
He'll promote me for sure.
The dynasty has a system for promoting talent.
Officials of high rank
were responsible for recommending talent.
So literati presented their best work
to get recognition.
It was a shortcut to official rank.
It was called "Passing the Scroll".
But..
How can such shortcuts
be open to those of humble birth?
The Tang soldiers are terrified.
You've seen that.
Once the Tubo army arrives
Yan Wu?
Yan Wu is coming back?
Yes! You know how strong he is.
We have to do this before that!
The tribesman are all prepared.
Understood!
But Li Bai
wouldn't open for him.
Brother Li -
Brother Gao, come with me!
No need to wait outside.
Our families have no ties either.
Brother Gao
my talent
I'm going.
Please go away.
He can't see you.
Has he read my essay?
Yes.
and you dare to "Pass the Scroll"?
He has eyes but can not see!
Blind!
Blind!
Let's go, Brother Gao!
That's how I learned
By the laws of our dynasty
even a wealthy merchant belongs to the lower class.
The son of a merchant
can't even take the civil service exam.
C'mon, Brother Gao!
To get an official position
His genius could light the dark.
His brilliance was obvious.
But I'd never met anyone
Waiter! Come!
Coming!
Bring us your best wine.
Brother Gao - bottoms up!
Brother Gao, come, quick.
See the Yangtze?
It flows from my hometown.
Endless waters, countless peaks -
this river brought me here.
Brother Gao, does your home have great rivers too?
Bohai has the Yellow River.
But I know the poem "Upon Stork Tower"
The sun rests on the peak before it fades
The Yellow River flows towards the sea
Wang Zhi huan's wonderful poem.
Waiter! Waiter!
Coming!
What can I do for you, sir?
I'm overcome with inspiration.
I want to dedicate a poem to Yellow Crane Tower.
Of course.
Sir,
I'll have one soon, it's in reach!
Stop stalling. Take me to the poetry boards.
Alright.
C'mon.
Our tower has a long history.
For centuries, guests have left poems here.
Just look around, sir.
A fine place.
Waiter, of all the poems here
To date the best one..
To date the best one...
I'm not so learned
It's by Master Cui Hao.
He's from the Cui clan of Boling.
The Cuis is are first among the Six Great Clans.
Young Master Cui
passed the civil service exams at nineteen.
Enough. Give me a brush.
Your brush.
This one, right?
He was inspired after drinking.
it's all marvelous!
The Ancient rode off on the Yellow Crane
On Parrot Isle, grasses lush arid green
Dusk sets in, where is my home?
Mist and waves, a melancholy scene.
Wonderful, really wonderful.
Such great talent!
Master Cui is young, elegant, high-born -
and so talented too.
Where did those two dolts come from?
Youthful ignorance, that's all.
Brother Gao -
I'll write Yellow Crane Tower's best-ever poem.
Brother Gao, let's make a date.
you must visit me in Yangzhou!
I'll show you the wonders by its famous bridges
and its beauties too.
I touch my sword.
I raise my eyes.
Like stones in clear water, I shall be seen.
Gao Thirty-five -
That splendid talent of yours
will one day burst forth from your heart.
We drink wine
And I sing for you.
Chang'an...
It was my first time there.
Chang'an...
Oh, I do beg your pardon!
Wang Changling?
Chang Jian!
Chang Jian?
Raise your hands.
Turn around. Okay.
I was a poor student, I'd never pass.
Aside from the exams
He's discerning and looks out for great talent.
Escaped?
You're young and accomplished.
Who was your mentor at court?
His Excellency, Inspector Eunuch Gao.
He was devoted to the court.
But Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo smeared his name
and he died in exile.
His Majesty has since eliminated that cabal.
I killed Li Fuguo myself.
You're loyal to your mentor.
That's rare.
had no one such as yourself.
people there saw the Gaos
as a clan past its prime.
Watch it.
S-so sorry, Mr Li.
Prince Qi thinks your spear dance marvellous
in tonight's program for Princess Yuzhen.
is less dancer than warrior.
Mr Li, please, please forgive me.
Princess Yuzhen is very cultured.
Good luck.
So be it.
I respect Prince Qi's wishes.
Prince Qi pushed two new acts on me tonight.
Whose boys are those loafing on the banks?
Prince Qi.
Only Prince Qi
He said
so I could show her my skills.
It's a bit scary.
As a battle technique it's superb.
Spear, spear.
The Gao Spear can kill enemies
How dare you, Gao Shi.
You... you naughty kid.
Your spear skills are impressive.
Little Master, how are you related to Prince Qi?
I'm not related.
My humble surname is Du, my name is Fu.
Du Fu, from Jingzhao
Ah, the Du family of Jingzhao.
It's an honor.
Come, listen.
This is Prince Qi's other program for tonight.
Who's this?
You've surely heard of him.
He's from the Wang clan of Hedong.
Wang Wei.
Red beans in the south flourish in the spring.
I knew his poetry and painting were sublime.
I do like you though.
Gao Shi, what are your other talents?
But as for poetry...
This way.
So striking and so talented!
What's going on?
This robe suits you better.
Princess Yuzhen is here.
Your Highness.
M'Lord.
Please, sit with me.
I wouldn't presume.
If you'd like a referral, just say the word.
You have a gift for recognizing greatness.
This way.
Actually, I'm so-so at those arts as well.
Especially my calligraphy - hideous.
I love writing poetry.
The successful candidates are "picking flowers".
Look!
"Picking flowers"?
It's a custom.
for tonight's celebrations in Qujiang.
Are you okay?
Pardon me!
And it's you!
Thank you, sir.
No problem. Please don't worry.
CHANG JIAN
Better to remain in Chang'an one more year.
Such a coincidence, dear.
We're off to sing at the Qujiang parties
We didn't expect to meet you here.
The scholar gave the lady a flower.
She'll have a lucky year.
Last night at Prince Qi's residence
The lyrics were beautiful.
I learned it a few days ago.
Miss, we need to hurry -
Li Bai.
Even a singsong girl knew his name.
Wang Wei, Li Bai, they were right.
Unknowns had no business in Chang'an.
I needed to go elsewhere,
So you went home?
Yes, but before I did,
I had an appointment to keep.
You went to Yangzhou?
I went to Yangzhou.
They were from Daming Temple. You owe me!
Yangzhou
was full of temptation and sweetness.
At the inn there, I asked about Li Bai.
Everyone knew him.
Brother Gao!
This is so unexpected!
We agreed to what?
This fellow, I've told you about him -
Dongting Lake, strong as an ox,
A Bohai Gao, Gao Shi, Gao Thirty-Five!
You're just in time.
We're about to do something big.
What's that?
We're going to save someone.
Come, come!
From the dragon's pool and tiger's lair
we'll rescue a divine beauty!
Dragon's pool, tiger's lair?
Stop there!
Brother Gao -
Master Li -
I was at Master Su's banquet.
I was only halfway into my dance
when you barged in and stole me away.
Where are you taking me?
Banquet?
Su Sixteen. Such a bore.
Dancing for such bores is so dull.
I rescued you from all that tedium.
Shouldn't you thank me?
But my mother won't forgive you.
Whatever. We're off to Master Pei's house.
Master Pei is with you?
Wu Daozi is coming to paint.
The General will do a sword dance to inspire him.
Wu Daozi's painting, General Pei's sword -
two treasures of the Tang in one night!
That's what I call a great banquet.
Stop that boat!
She's on that boat! Chase it!
Row faster, faster!
Master Li, don't be angry.
I can't make General Pei's banquet.
That's my bad luck.
What if instead, here on this boat
Why not.
Great!
Thank you, Master Li.
A beautiful Zhezhi Dance.
A beauty's smile as precious as gold
Master Li, did you like tonight's dance?
It outshone the moon on the river!
It's your reward.
Thank you, kind sir.
But
you caused big trouble tonight.
Of course, yes!
This ring is white jade from Mt Tian.
Take it!
Marvelous dancing, a beautiful night!
Youth is fleeting, age is upon me
Flowers fade; my heart is heavy
I long in dreams; reach for that sun-filled place.
Come!
Incredible!
I can't see.
We're late, we were delayed on the river.
The Way of calligraphy!
Yes, while watching Wu Daozi paint.
What luck!
Wonderful!
The night is young.
Brother Gao, aren't you coming?
Brother Li, forgive my directness.
But spending money like water -
how long can you go on like this?
A great man aims to serve his country.
Serve the country?
Your family's spear is famous.
Would the talented Master Gao
My pleasure.
both arts perfected on the battlefield.
What a good contest.
but for killing enemies.
Bravo!
and he's a great military man.
My father
but at home in Yangzhou
he can only use his sword to entertain.
I'm a woman.
Talent! Talent!
The verdant stream plucks night's strings
Golden times are fleeting
Storms make gloomy the years.
An exceptional woman
as fine a poet as a swordswoman.
She dresses like a man. Her father indulges her.
is nothing to be ashamed of.
Let's go, let's get a drink.
But you just got to Yangzhou!
The Great Eagle will soar one day.
Gao Thirty-Five -
you just stopped stuttering!
It's true.
Reporting!
Sir, it's urgent military news.
The whole Tubo army has left Yunshan.
and is headed towards Lushui Pass.
How far are they from Lushui Pass?
Six hours.
Please, sit. We still have time.
I returned to Liang Gardens in Shangqiu.
It was spring again.
Brother Gao -
Gao Shi -
we caught a thief by the village temple.
He says he's your friend!
Brother Gao, long time no see.
Li Bai!
He was napping naked in the temple!
He doesn't look respectable.
I apologise.
Mr Gao says he's a friend.
Gao Shi.
remember I taught you the art of wrestling?
Come, let's have a match.
Gao Shi, you've improved a lot.
You win, Brother Gao.
You look well.
Brother Li, have you been well?
No, I've been wretched.
Forget it!
Come, let's drink. C'mon.
Sure.
Fishing with straight hooks like Duke Jiang?
He never caught any fish.
But I have.
Cheers.
Oh, I'm learning to write poetry too.
Lonely view of autumn grasses
Bitter winds blow for thousands of miles
You've read my poetry?
That's fine. Who cares?
I never seemed to improve.
One day I skipped class.
Know what I saw by the stream?
I asked, what are you doing?
The old woman said
So I went back and studied.
Studying is always hard.
You see, I had to work hard too.
Brother Li, is that a true story?
Poor as I am
and with no hope of an official position,
what family would give me their daughter's hand?
I'm getting married.
The Xus of Anlu.
That's right.
I really must congratulate you!
and a few ruined pavilions.
Worldly prosperity is an illusion.
Ephemeral as a flower's bloom.
All those years in Yangzhou
I received terrible news from home.
They said I'd already frittered away my share.
I...
I had no idea.
where I fell suddenly and terribly ill
and nearly died.
That night..
I think of home.
I'm getting married!
In a month, I'll go to Anlu
and pay my respects to the Xus.
Though my sons won't bear my surname
the surname Xu
By joining them as a son-in-law
he could change his status.
Society disdained men who did that.
It's not far from Xiangyang. Look!
to get some advice.
Meng Haoran lives in a wonderland.
Brother Gao, you'll adore Meng Haoran!
Meng Haoran.
Of course I knew his name.
Deep sleeps of spring
all around me birds sing.
A loud stormy night
Master Meng isn't home. He left two days ago.
He left?
where he'd change boats for Yangzhou.
Brother Li!
Hurry, we'll race to Jiangxia
and catch him before his boat leaves.
I'm sure he's going to Yangzhou to see me!
Which is the boat for Yangzhou?
Brother Li!
Mr Meng!
The advice I asked for.
should I do it or not?
The sound of the wind muffled his answer.
Mr Meng!
Brother Gao, I need your strength!
Waiter!
Give me brush and ink.
Okay, sir, let me go.
The lone boat slowly vanishes against the sky
Waiter -
these excellent lines of mine.
How do they compare with Cui Hao's?
Very fine, very fine.
Master Cui's poem is eight lines.
Brother Gao -
I was just overcome with inspiration.
more years fled past.
I decided to join the army.
I'm awkward in company.
I didn't have Li Bai's ease
We Gaos have always been military men.
That's the Gao family's destiny.
You're known for your literary talent.
Come.
This man leads a frontline cavalry.
If you win, I'll give you your own cavalry.
What are we competing in?
Wrestling.
Good choice!
Our opponents are Khitans.
They're renowned wrestlers.
Fine. Let's wrestle.
Bravo!
Well done!
Captain Gao!
That whole year in Jizhou
I didn't write a single poem.
For months
we found no trace of them.
There! Over there!
The Khitans are burning the plains!
Retreat!
A cavalry platoon of the Right Army
All soldiers mobilize!
From start to finish
The next order I received
Gao Thirty-five -
Go home.
Those soldiers are off to Longxi.
Their hair is whiter than mine
and they still can't shed their armor.
like to leave a little something here.
Want to write a poem?
There's charcoal by the wall.
I...
wrote poetry again.
The Han fight the fierce enemy far from home
The men vanquish all before them.
Gao Shi.
Hey.
Gao Shi.
Gao Shi.
Who's there?
Me!
Brother Li?
Brother Gao, ah, Brother Gao
I never imagined meeting you here.
Brother Li, you...
I'm fleeing for my life.
Gao Shi -
it's the best one you've ever written.
Congratulations!
In the general's tent, beauties dance
Gao Thirty-five -
these lines will live forever!
Brother Li, you're too kind.
I went to Anlu.
Later my father-in-law died.
He pushed me aside.
One day Master Danqiu came by.
He's an old friend from home.
Of course.
It's not something that comes quickly.
I could serve the Tang on the frontier.
guess what I discovered?
An Lushan
was planning a rebellion.
That's a capital crime!
Do you have proof?
This one.
The tailor made a mistake.
But not one of the Tang!
I returned the robe.
But as it turned out -
I was deciding what to do
and executed.
I have to find an official
Everyone who tries, dies.
It's damn useless.
Who's there?
So what's the point of reporting?
Please, who are you?
You -
Li Bai, Gao Shi -
You've heard of me?
They found me!
Li Bai, come out.
Who are you?
I'm Guo Ziyi.
Guo Ziyi?
You're meddling in the Pinglu Army's affairs now?
Yes.
I have a houseful of men here
So it's all of our business.
Guo Ziyi, your great reputation precedes you. Great skills.
You'll pay for this one day.
Let's go.
So, before the sun sets
they're going to execute you at the inn?
Military discipline is harsh.
today it's my turn.
But it's wrong!
Heaven gave us these gifts -
When I arrived yesterday
I heard Geshu Han was leading his army west.
They're half a day's march away.
I'll go plead with him.
Do all you can to protect Brother Guo.
I'll be back before sunset!
Stop the execution!
So the two of you
Such a talented man
shouldn't die a wrongful death.
No one could've known.
Brother Gao,
It wasn't too hard.
He wanted me to work for him.
I said that in the future
wherever he led his troops into battle
he just had to call for me
I still don't.
I give myself ten years.
Ten years.
was ten years ago, yes?
Ten years.
Right.
I'll also give myself ten years.
Let's see if in ten years
we can make it into the court.
Gao Shi -
Hard is the journey, hard is the journey
One day the wind and waves will favor me
you're back!
Not really, I still need you!
Great!
would spread wide and far.
From then on everyone knew
that I, Gao Shi, was a poet.
I could finally study on my own.
But, the poem's fame
made the general I spoke of -
And caused all the high officials
to avoid me like the plague.
A literary man.
Back home in Shangqiu,
ten years slipped past.
I hope you've been well.
Li Bai wrote to me.
In ten years searching for immortality and the Tao
His fame, however, had grown.
Out of the blue came an imperial summons
and he was called to Chang'an.
As a member of the Hanlin Academy
His Majesty Xuan zong believed in the Tao.
Li Bai said
By then she had converted to Taoism.
Unworldly people
He -
He invited me to Chang'an.
Excuse me, sir -
how can I get to Longevity Hall?
Mr Li is truly an unbridled genius.
I toss back my head, laugh at the sky, we will not stay down for long.
Beautiful line. Peerless!
Such a free spirit!
is this Li Bai's home?
Yes, he lives here.
It's been ages, ages!
And you, my good man, are...?
Twenty years ago, at Prince Qi's residence
we hid together inside a lion.
I'm Du Fu!
So it's you!
This is wonderful.
But my favourite is your line
So free and elegant!
You're too kind.
expresses such lofty ideals.
Are you here to see Li Bai too?
Yes. I knocked but no one answered.
He hasn't been home for days.
He's quite a drinker!
We'll look for him together.
Qujiang Pool!
Brother Du, are you preparing for the exams?
Inspector He is fine.
See? Sound asleep in the pool!
Hurry, Li Bai is up there now!
What was Inspector He's line?
Don't mourn spring's fallen petals
spring's fallen petals -
Great line!
Tomorrow we enter a glorious garden!
How's that?
No problem.
Du Fu?
A new friend?
It's Cui Zongzhi's turn.
Can't I pass?
No!
I'm afraid of heights!
You're younger than Inspector He -
you need a longer plank!
Here's a lute.
Play and you'll be fine!
Li Bai.
You missed! You're fined two cups!
Come, come. This is -
Gao Shi -
you've all heard of him, right?
We've been good friends for over 20 years.
Come, let me introduce you.
Prince of Ruyang!
Emperor Ruizong's eldest grandson!
It's an honor.
And this here
is Li Yong, Prefect Li -
A pleasure!
I'm honored.
And these two gentlemen
are Wang Changling and Cen Shen!
Just a minor poem.
As if brought by a spring breeze
Snow blooms on trees like pear blossoms
Honored to meet you.
Cui Zongzhi - young and gifted!
I'm honored.
Brother Wang Wei!
Brother Wang Wei is here too.
Such serendipity!
My turn!
I'll have a go.
I...
Brother Changling, are you having trouble?
Here I come!
Give me the lute.
Li Bai is no ordinary mortal.
He's a celestial being!
Exotic Beauty - dance faster!
Here we go!
A jade cup with wine of perfect clarity
Bravo!
you wrote a new poem.
It's not even the same form.
Sure, what's the penalty?
Beauty - dance faster still!
Even my horse is keen to go home.
No need to see me off.
You only just got to Chang'an
and now you're rushing off?
Li Bai -
when Brother Li Bai sobers up
he'll definitely want to keep you here.
This endless drinking -
when will he ever sober up?
The Great Eagle soars amongst the clouds
He has no time for mundanities.
I don't blame him.
Brother Du -
before I leave
would you go somewhere with me?
Brother Du -
he captured the Turks' Chebi Khan.
At 42
he passed away.
I'm 43 this year.
Brother Du -
I hope you pass the exam and are admitted to court.
Here's to your early success.
Farewell!
Take care.
Good shot.
Why didn't you shoot?
A solitary goose
flying back south -
let it go.
Brother Gao, such compassion -
Brother Du Fu!
Li Bai -
you..
why are you wearing Taoist robes?
These last few years in Chang'an
The emperor's Precious Consort hates me.
Chang'an
His Majesty...
To bow and scrape before the high-born
I will enter a Taoist order.
A Taoist order?
Gao Shi -
I'm not joking.
once King Liang's garden palace.
Where is he now?
This terrace -
once rang with song and dance.
we both had such ambition.
But in the blink of an eye
here we are, nearly fifty.
Gao Shi -
Life is short.
Master Gao of Beihai
has prepared a Taoist altar in Jinan.
Brother Gao, you may not know
Brother Li must ascend that altar
Gao Shi -
This Great Eagle
can no longer fly
and doesn't want to either.
He said
I was his best friend.
In any case
I agreed.
Newly ordained Taoists,
Brother Li
Nothingness will be your teacher
and nature your friend.
and extend your golden life.
Brother Gao -
You're a holy man.
Yes!
Wine is part of my spiritual practice.
Gao Shi -
in the 20 years of our acquaintance
Come! Come!
Drink up!
Bottoms up!
I can't drink anymore.
That won't do.
I'm done too.
No way.
Master Cen
Master Danqiu
You have to keep drinking!
Everyone has to drink.
No one stop!
I have a poem!
I'll revive your spirits with poetry.
Can you see
the Yellow River decanting from the sky
And racing to the sea never to return?
As dawn's black silk turns to evening snow?
When life goes well, be joyous
Never show the moon an empty cup
Heaven gave me talent for a reason
Tonight we'll drink three hundred cups at least
Master Cen, Master Danqiu
drink and don't put down your cups
I'll sing for you -
Ancient sages leave no name
It's great drinkers who enjoy great fame
Wine flowed like water
Hosts shouldn't fret over costs -
Buy more wine and fill those cups
Fine horses, expensive robes -
Tell the servant to sell these for wine
Li Bai -
You're going?
Perhaps we won't see each other again.
If we don't -
see you in the celestial realms.
As for me -
I'm of this world.
I'll linger here.
Li Bai -
I'm off to the frontier to serve under Geshu Han.
I'll keep my ten year vow.
Your poem said it all.
The Yellow River racing to the sea, never to return.
when I face my ancestors
Such lofty spirit!
Bravo, bravo!
But, Gao Shi -
If you're going to the frontier at your age
let me test how strong you are!
Come
let's wrestle.
Sure!
Gao Shi -
you won.
Go then.
Go then.
Farewell.
Curved swords bright as shining snow
Galloping past like shooting stars
I wrote this poem 20 years ago
it was my impression of you, Gao Shi!
The living are but passers-by
The ancient dust is soaked with tears.
When I first got to Longyou
we laid siege to Stone Fort.
It's easy to defend, hard to attack.
Starved of supplies, the Tubos finally surrendered
only 600 men had defended the fort.
A mere 600 defenders
kept us pacing outside its walls half a year.
Yunshan Fort
is another Stone Fort.
Reporting!
Dawn.
I often read his new poems.
Sir -
Do you have many regrets in life?
Regrets?
Of course.
Even if I perform meritorious deeds,
Everyone feels in danger.
Among the poets I know
Governor of Beihai, Li Yong.
Frontier life is hard, but uncomplicated.
Ten years flew by.
My life was nearing its end.
In all this time
I only saw Li Bai once.
was in Xuan City on official business.
Who's that?
Magistrate Wang Lun is a big fan.
That's Li Bai's new wife.
a few centuries worth of events occur.
An Lushan
had been plotting rebellion for over ten years.
Who'd have thought that
Yang Guozhong took his place.
An Lushan
Reporting!
Gao Xian zhi and Feng Changqing
were both executed.
The great dynasty has no generals left.
I'm the last, and I'm half-paralyzed.
If I defy orders to fight this important battle
the court will naturally execute me too.
Who will succeed me?
I fear it'll be the Eunuch Inspector Bian Lingcheng
If I were a little younger
it'd be much better.
The Tubos lurk about the herds
The whole army is in agreement.
Help me onto my horse.
Gao Shi -
and tell the emperor
that not all northern tribes are traitors!
General!
Go, Gao Shi!
I, Geshu Han,
won't surrender!
Go!
Tong Pass had fallen.
The court had fled from Chang'an.
They killed the Chancellor
and made the Precious Consort commit suicide.
some powerful and ambitious men
The world was in chaos.
YANGZHOU. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE FALL OF TONG PASS
The new Southern Region Governor
and quelled the prince's rebellion.
GAO SHI, SOUTHERN REGION GOVERNOR
Reporting, sir.
Sir -
Reporting, sir -
Prince Yong issued a call to all "heroes".
Read it.
that led me, a lowly official of below 8th Rank
within six months
Governor, we have news of Prince Yong's army.
Tell me.
They'll arrive in three days.
Prince Yong is a mediocrity, more ambitious than wise.
If he wanted to win control
It wouldn't be easy, but if successful,
it would change the world.
How can he win the loyalty of heroes?
Does he have much clout?
Have any great men joined in his cause?
but no one has answered.
Oh, right, except one poet.
Li Bai.
Li Bai is on Prince Yong's side?
Li Bai wrote eleven whole poems for him.
Eleven poems?
Mt Beigu was once a fortress of Wu
The towers reflections shimmered on the water
Madam Li -
Prince Yong has been executed.
I know.
Li Bai -
I failed to advance my spiritual state.
Prince Yong sent several emissaries
to invite me to help him.
I wanted such a chance my whole life.
Though I'm old, how could I refuse?
You didn't know he was rebelling?
Rebelling?
Wasn't he the Tang's top military officer?
Top military officer?
You didn't realise that in such chaos
all types of men would claim the throne?
But...
Li Bai -
Jiangxia.
Yellow Crane Tower.
Right. Gao Shi, Governor Gao -
Jiangxia... Yellow Crane Tower...
You...
Don't you see?
Just come and see this!
Everywhere is like Jiangxia.
Everywhere is in ruins like Yellow Crane Tower.
Madam Li -
Please don't worry about me.
I'm not like my husband.
I'll spend my remaining years in seclusion on Mt Lu.
Take care.
Wife!
Wife!
I'll return to Mt Lu!
Wait for me!
You didn't save Li Bai.
You were always one step from the abyss.
Instead of execution, exile in the southwest.
is under your command.
Yes.
The Tubos have besieged Chang'an for three months.
Are you afraid of repeating Geshu Han's mistake
when his army was annihilated outside Tong Pass?
In old age, haste leads to error.
But the gossip in court has it
that you and Guo Ziyi
fell out over whether to save Li Bai
The emperor sent me here
The Tubos have also heard this rumor.
Reporting!
Reporting, Governor
Tubo troops are halfway through the valley.
They're three hours away from here.
Of the men at the Qujiang wine shop that day
He Zhizhang, Wang Changling, Cui Zongzhi are dead.
Though still alive
Du Fu wanders homeless,
and Wang Wei, imprisoned by the traitors,
This candle
I apologise, sir.
But it's time to take back Yunshan Fort.
Hand me my spear!
This is a long-forgotten old road.
The steep path can't accommodate a large army.
But it's a shortcut.
I understand.
Instead, you're taking a step back
Now those 70,000 Tubo soldiers
have no escape route.
But Governor Gao, Lushui Pass may be risky.
What if they can't defend it?
You're right.
The man who came here was his messenger.
The reinforcements are here!
Your Excellency is famous for being straightforward
and yet you pulled off this masterful ruse.
Chang'an will be saved.
As Inspector Gao's top disciple
you're of course a great martial artist too.
That year of the rebellion
Inspector Gao took on the enemy single-handed.
And you are his worthy successor!
Governor Gao -
wouldn't such a provocation be too obvious?
Assemble! Hurry!
This is for Chang'an!
Chang'an!
Fall into formation!
Gao Shi - Do you know how to trick your opponent?
Yan Wu is young, vigorous and brave.
I take my leave.
Oh, how is he?
Very good.
You wanted to save Li Bai
Your Excellency, I guessed right, yes?
I also have news of Li Bai.
What?
Before the New Year, the emperor announced an amnesty.
Li Bai has been pardoned!
He wrote a new poem after his pardon.
Out from Baidi amongst the colored clouds
My little boat passes by ten thousand peaks.
My little boat passes by ten thousand peaks.
He hadn't reached his place of exile
In this collection,
whose poems do you like?
Who else?
Cui Hao, Meng Haoran, Wang Changling are all great!
Cen Shen too.
You'll understand them one day.
Of course.
Sir, don't think badly of me
Chang'an in a flood of moonlight, ten thousand homely sounds
No taste!
It's okay.
So long as the Yellow Crane Tower poems exist
Yellow Crane Tower is still with us.
Of the three hundred thousand, only I returned to Chang'an.
A young soldier of Chang'an
Wang Wei!
Li Bai! Li Taibai!
Chang'an is like a dream; when might I return?
Chang'an -
Chang'an will still be with us.
Li Bai, at your service.
Gao Shi, at yours.
In winter, Li Bai passed away
In the second year of Emperor Daizong's reign,

So you just moved to the area, or?
Mm-hmm. From Ashford.

By yourself, or you got family around here?
Oh.
Yes. Straight in your pocket.
Yeah, I mean, hell, if you take to the job,
Really?
Wow, that'd be great.

Oh. Yeah, that's terrible.
Yeah.
I would normally work the double,

It is with a girl, so.
Fucking Yogi, don't do this to me.
Sorry, that's Yogi. Yogi, come on.
Why would you do this today?
Oh, here.
Oh. Hey, thank you.
Really gotta get this thing fixed. Oh my.
Oh, heavy. Oh, let's see.
Look, I know it looks as
but trust me, they, they did not.
They never lived here. This place is harmless.
I'm gonna remodel Miles Ahead Motel.
What you think?
Looks good.
Yeah, it could be pretty sweet.
It's already got five stars built in,
And hell, who knows? You know, if business booms,
then maybe get a franchise out of it.
Like, that'll be, yeah. Yeah.
truth be told.
Mostly folks just passing through to Denning.
Now, we got 20 cabins.
All are basically identical.
Okay, so queen bed,
mini fridge, phone.
And standard-definition television.
Okay. Let's see.
Shower, toilet, all pretty much standard.
but eight still needs some doing.
Okay, cabin eight. Got it.
I think I can handle it.
A French what?
Not only will the bed look more comfortable,
but the guests will feel the softness when they climb in.
Yeah. My mom used to work in motels.
Okay, here we have the supply room.
and this brick will keep you from getting locked in.
More cleaning supplies above the washer-dryer combo.
Fuse box right over here. What else?
Just give me a second, okay?
Been on the phone with the county
I've never seen one before.
Yeah. Sucked all the water in the damn ground.
Luckily, nobody was swimming in it.
Teddy, how come cabin 13 is only 45.50?
Oh, superstition.
People are fucking stupid. They will believe anything.
Have you eaten?
Not yet.
Well, Postmates don't come out this far,
and the wifi is a little janky,
but if you're in the mood for some killer pho.
Yeah, it's the best Vietnamese in town.
It's the only Vietnamese in town. Yeah.
So, I do believe that is, that's everything.
Security?
Oh, we have, I mean,
Oh. I mean, protection.
What if I get some asshole guest?
Oh, just call the police.
Well, if you want,
there's a fire ax next to the vending machine.
Nobody's gonna mess with you
Okay, Gwen.
Relax, okay?
I know it seems a little spooky, but trust me,
I haven't had any trouble here,
But I tell you what,
there's a deadbolt in the parlor.
Trust me, Gwen, you're gonna be fine.
Is that rats?
Oh, no, that's not rats.
Okay, that's rats. That is rats.
Okay, I'll tell you what.
Pho is on me, okay?
Whew, it's chilly tonight.
7:00 A.M. okay?
And Gwen, welcome to the night shift.
Ms. Marsh.
Ms. Marsh?
My name is Gwen. I just started the night shift.
Do you need anything? Fresh towels, perhaps?
No.
Okay.
Oh my God.
Oh my god!
- Sir! Sir! Stop! - Are you crazy?
Dare you hit my son?
Sir, stop that please!
Hello...
We just need to tell them that we live together.
Mom!
Boss.
What?
Nothing.
Are you looking at pictures of other countries? Something Dutch?
Yes.
Yes, we will deliver immediately.
What are you waiting for? Go deliver it!
My kid loves the noodles at this restaurant

Hyun-woo!
Go back out!
- Hyun-woo! - Quickly go out!
Let me go!
Hyun-woo.
Three hundred won.
You're young but you need so much.
When you were busy...I helped.
It's difficult for me to give you such a large amount.
Just go ask your father.
I can't turn to that jerk.
Please help me.
Since I was born.
Grab that bastard.
- Wait - Come here.
Don't move fuck.
Don't move.
Wow, isn't that funny? Do you have any feeling now?
Want to feel it again?
I'm Yook Seong-hun.
You're doomed.
I'm Myeong-hun's elder brother.
My younger brother.
It must be very painful.
He says no.
Yeon-gyu.
have you tried to get the compensation?
You are not beggars.
No. Maybe you should call him uncle?
How dare you
Go to hell.
Fuck.
Let's eat.
Kim Yeon-gyu!
Going to work?
Yuk Myeong Hoon saw me, but he turned and left.
Seems like he grew up after being beaten up.
Fuck, Why is it?
Is it a monthly motor?
Monthly motor.
Give me a ride.
Brother.
Why am I your brother? You crazy woman.
- Don't be rude. Nonsense. - Stop acting so friendly.
You silly woman.
What are you doing?
The problem is solved right?
School...I can go to school again.
It is really from a friend I knew in the neighborhood.
Yes.
Why did you let your friend call me?
His name is Yook Myeong-hun
Yeon-gyu.
Are you pretending to sleep?
Dad's business is not good these days that's why he is like that.
I won't let dad drink anymore.
You...
I thought I tried it, but it probably won't work.
No, I have to save money.
Your wound...You're bleeding.
Guests coming to eat feel uncomfortable.
You tell me what to do?
I am busy.
Wipe your face.
Hurry and go.
Come in.
What?
Wanna pay interest to me?
- I want to make money. - Impossible.
Go home.
Hurry up.
You must have a key to start the engine, right?
Just catch them and make it run like this. Easy right?
There.
21st September.
Wait at least five months before coming back.
Oh right.
Five slaps.
Damn, someone over there.
Try this place.
What?
You should try it by yourself beside learning.
Don't stare at me, brat!
What's all this about? What are we here for?
For work.
For theft.
Okay, I see.
Yes, boss.
Hey, thief!
Get yourself busy.
P.A.
Big brother is here!
Keep working.
I'll be stressed for that. Don't worry.
Just do whatever you like.
Yes, I'll do it.
I've worked everything out this time. You are gonna make it.
No.
You're too nervous in preparations for the election, right?
- Jeong Ui Seok. - Yeah!
Jeong Ui Seok.
Yeah!
Watch your step, brother.
Chi-geon.
Yeah.
Okay, please make yourself at home.
It's still a long way to go.
Back to work.
When?
What?
You never gave me money.
Take it.
Take it, Yeon-gyu
Take it. No problem.
Dad will stop drinking.
Did you eat.
Get what you want from the fridge.
I don't drink.
Drink it.
Let me show you.
My mother always said the same thing.
It's the same with or without a dad.
I think also.
together with Kim Ha-yan.
They said they had registered their marriage,
He treats mom well,
You've lived here since you were little, right?
What?
I have never left this place either.
A hopeless neighborhood.
Nothing.
So that person's daughter...
Kim Ha-yan.
Because we live together...
There's no such place.
I'd be there if there was. Fuck.
But.
You don't know me.
Go home
Thank you.
- Come back? - Yeah.
You got a new job.
In that case, you should pick me a new one.
It's exactly the same as before.
The minimum loan amount is three million won.
You  can use the extra money for the restaurant's running.
Your behavior needs a beaten to get better.
I don't do it anymore.
Why take the money, but don't give me the goods?
Bitch, did I say I'd do it?
That's your job. Aren't you going to make money?
{\an8} [Student card] I've earned enough.
You!
Listen.
Bitch.
I'm Seong-hun.
If you want to live in peace, bring that bitch's phone here.
Have you guys slept together?
What's up?
Hey, Kim Ha-yan.
Give it to me.
75.
You've been doing well lately, Yeon-gyu.
65.
What is this.
That's mine.
It's expensive.
When the shift ends, staff will be gone.
I just asked.
to be a clean public servant.
See if he goes as I order.
The problem is, after we call him over.
If we gag him.
He has a son.
His son.
How about using some photos?
Hey, kid the big brothers' talking.
Do you know PS?
What?
Photos.
What kind of photos?
Some weird photos.
Kind of like smelling women's underwear...
It's still being paid off, isn't it?
- Shut up - Seung Mu.
But your interest keeps rolling in.
If you do a good job. I'll waive some of the interest.
Okay.
So how much is the interest forgiven?
Let's cut you 80%.
I heard you're running for office this time.
Yes. Thank you in advance.
A lot of taxi drivers got mad.
But my son also takes that subway.
But not now.
Well.. What's wrong? Is it serious?
It was just a head injury at first.
Councilman,
I'm the one who borrowed the money.
Uncle, stop there.
- What is he doing? - Seung Mu!
Just wait and see.
What are you doing?
This bastard!
Wipe away your tears. Uncle.
Hurry up!
Go check it.
I told you to call, but you didn't.
My phone battery's dead.
Sorry.
You don't know..
what my kid looks like now.
Are you bold enough now?
As planned. Let's go see the old man first.
Yeah.
What.
Boss asked me to show you this.
I'm doing this.
Work hard. You'll be treated well.
Too little? Want more?
What’s that?
We left before.
No problem.
Thank you, boss.
Yeon-gyu, come here.
Don't call boss anymore, call me brother.
Brother.
This is your house.
It's where you belong.
Go.
What?
Can I ask you a favor?
Say it.
Nothing.
Not him.
Fuck, what does this guy want?
Don't get too much.
Like Americans who only know how to eat bugers.
What?
Those guys won't bother you again.
go to school.
What are you wearing? Like some maniac.
I'm what?
Get inside.
Get inside first.
Damn it!
You wanna me to die?
Kill me now.
Today's meal is not so bad.
Madwoman!
Kim Ha-yan.
You think I'm funny, don't you?
Tell Me!
Eat them, quick.
Didn't I say I'd quit drinking?
Answer me, bitch!
Are you crazy?
My daughter actually said I was crazy.
Yeon-gyu, you heard it!
Get out!
Find me a sixth stepmother!
How long do I have to do this?
Put it down!
Brother.
Who are you guys?
Fuck, who are you?
What?
Sorry.
I will from now on.
Don't move.
Don't move, it'll be over soon.
Sorry, brother.
I have to do this.
Sorry, brother.
If not, then pay the debt for him.
Stand up.
Kim Ha-yan!
- So light! that's all. - That's my price.
- It's light. I don't care.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
It's so old!
Does this still work?
So why?
Sucks, huh?
Yeon-gyu.
Pay back the money.
What?
Leave him alone.
Just eat.
You also eat.
Everyone, fill up your drinks.
Let's drink.
Uncle, you have a drink too.
I wish you well!
Did I do something wrong?
Eat up, everyone.
Let me have a toast, brother.
Leave him alone.
Every family has a skeleton in the cupboard.
Your mother is old.
Now it's time for you to help me.
Go!
Youngest brother!
Eighteen.
Brother.
He's young, So he doesn't know the rules.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are you doing this?
Yes, when I was a kid.
It sucks here.
and didn't emerge.
and passed away.
There is a person who often come here to fish.
About five minutes later,
He was happy and used all his strength to pull it up.
However,
the fish he caught was tiny.
So speechless,
He was extremely surprised.
He didn't catch a fish,
it was half of a child's ear.
When the man pulled the boy up, obviously, he's dead,
So he thouhgt,
but the boy had disappeared somewhere.
Actually, that boy
ran to where the old man was waiting.
Dad...
Why didn't save me?
Huh?
Fuck.
When he was pulled out, the boy was already dead.
Take me with you.
I'm just doing what I can.
What's that?
What can you do?
the day before the election, candidate Jeong Ui Seok of Myeongan
announced his withdrawal and leaving the party.
It's unavoidable.
Wait!
Is that the youngest brother?
Youngest brother...
I'm about to call to him.
One phone call! Just give me one call!
Yes, Elder.
It's absolutely not that.
I just don't want to do it anymore.
I want to leave this town.
After resting, I will explain everything
Thank you, brother.
Yes, big brother.
I just received the money.
I'm sorry.
Please sympathize with me.
Still haven't called back?
Yeah.
Get it done tonight.
Yeah, got it.
Then,
bring one of his hands.
Oldest brother.
Nothing.
He wants to see you.
Wait a moment. Coming!
Mom?
Yeon-gyu
What happened?
I...
Go home, Yeon-gyu.
Come talk to me face to face.
About that.
There's nothing I can do about it.
You did it, right?
The motorbike.
What do you mean?
What should I do now?
[Big Brother Chi-geon]
Order number two!
- What? - Kim Ha-yan.
Help me.
How many more are there?
The last one!
When did you come to this neighborhood?
What are you trying to say anyway?
You pushed the child into the water, there has to be someone who pulls him up.
It wasn't me.
[Oldest brother]
Yes, Elder.
Yes, the youngest brother is back.
You said if he came you would agree to his request.
Please give me some time, I will definitely...
Kim Yeon-gyu.
This is the only thing I can do.
He said he will bring the money.
Alright.
Go.
Go.
The number you have dialed is busy.
Hey.
Don't you feel bad for Kim Yeon-gyu?
Why is everyone torturing him?
I want to live like before.
I quit.
Is everything done?
Ha-yan...
I'm sorry.
Let's go.
You're crazy.
Let me go!
Kim Yeon-gyu!
Either way, that child is dead.
When it sank into the water.
Yeon-gyu
Feed him with some yukgaejang.
Tidy it up.
Mom...
Mommy...
Ha-yan.
Ha-yan...
Yeon-gyu...
I'm sorry. Yeon-gyu
My Ha-yan, What happened.
I'm sorry, Yeon-gyu.
Dad didn't mean to...
I thought something happened to Ha-yan...
I don't remember... why...
- Ma'am! Ma'am! - Be quiet!
Be careful.
You should come with me now.
We'll run away from here.
They are outside.
They are outside.
Please listen to me. We should get out of here.
Save yourself.
Wait!
Take her!
Matsuya... Matsuya!
I beg you, let us go.
You promised to help us all.
We?
I helped you.
I have given all the information you asked.
I have betrayed my own country.
I beg you...
Poor Netherland.
Tonight you will die in my country.
Quickly!
Come on!
So?
Let's play guessing games.
Alright.
It's five.
Wrong.
How many are these?
No, don't.
I'm not cheating, the answer is eleven.
How can it be eleven?
One and one. Eleven.
Ambar.
Ambar.
Don't look.
Turn left.
Is it still far, Dika?
<i>Retirement Home</i>
This way.
Careful, there's a car.
Come on. This way.
Ambar! Dika!
Mom!
This way!
This way.
During Eid holidays, many residents are away.
Come in.
Wow, it's so big!
Agus, please take them to their room.
Come on.
Dika, let's go.
This is your room.
This is nice!
Where should I sleep?
Dika, don't mess up this room, okay?
Okay.
Let's go.
He looks so happy.
I hope you and Dika feel at home here.
One moment.
There's a piano!
I only know that song.
Don't be noisy, Dika.
What is this picture?
Dika.
This retirement home was opened in the 1970's.
Their parents have passed away.
So they are going to stay here.
Ambar, Dika, I will introduce you to the others.
Come on in, Ambar.
This is Grandma Ani.
Sit here, dear.
Ambar, this is Grandma Ani.
Hello, Grandma Ani.
Sit here.
Here.
Are you blind?
Ani, don't say that.
She can still see.
It's okay. I can still see, but not as clearly as others.
Very blurry.
Same like grandpa.
It's because you drank too much, grandpa.
Ambar, this is Rina.
Hi, Rina.
Rina, please come here.
Have you two rested?
No, we haven't.
I want to say goodbye too.
Is it alright, grandma?
- Take care, ma'am. - Yes, okay.
My grandson...
Grandma!
I'm sorry for coming late.
You should stay here for a week until Eid.
Yes, grandma.
Arthur, come greet the others.
Hello, everybody.
He just got here...
Hey!
What are you doing holding her hand?
No.
Dika.
But he rarely visits.
My grandson doesn't fast.
Catch it, grandpa.
Be careful, grandpa is old.
I'm sorry, Rina.
Slowly.
Yes, I can.
Slowly.
I can do it, right?
I can if it's this close.
I admire you.
Your parents have died. And you have to take care of Dika.
I really don't expect this.
It's spilled.
It's okay. I'll clean it up.
Ambar.
I'm sorry.
It's alright, I understand.
It's me who has to thank you and Aunt Wati for having me here.
Right, Rina?
<i>Agus!</i>
Yes, grandma.
Ambar, come.
Put this.
Look.
If you need help, just press the bell, this one.
Okay.
Rina?
What's the matter?
We are friends since we were little.
Put it there. No, not there.
Take a picture with the drinks too, grandpa.
Dika, pick that up!
Don't do that.
Just catch this.
Chase it!
Wait. We'll take a picture first.
One, two, three.
Catch this, grandpa!
Here, grandpa.
Grandpa.
Let's go inside. It's going to rain.
Grandpa! The frisbee went inside.
Really?
Dika!
It's raining now.
Just leave it there.
Let's take it.
Okay, let's find the door.
Slowly, be careful.
Here's the door.
Dika!
Yes?
Oh my!
Dika!
I'm here!
Dika!
Dika!
Dika!
Dika.
It's Arthur, right?
Ms. Wati always locks up this place.
Or, you don't have one?
Dika, you have found your toy, right?
Let's go home.
Dika.
Dika.
Wow, so cool.
There are lots of things here.
There are many things.
It looks dirty.
What is this?
Lots of old stuff.
Ambar!
What is this? Shit.
Ambar...
Come on.
Ambar.
No, I'm alright.
Thanks.
Ouch!
What is this place?
What is that?
An early model gramophone.
Like an old compo?
Something like that.
There's a pot here.
I think all of the pots upstairs were made here.
The tools are there.
A chest!
What is this?
Be careful.
What is that, Ambar?
What is that, Arthur?
This...
It's a statue, right?
Why is it headless?
Let's go back, Ambar.
Ambar? Dika?
Wow, what is this place?
Ambar, Dika, Arthur?
I just knew there is a basement here.
Agus, come here.
There is something interesting.
Gold? Really?
- Let's take this upstairs. - Good idea.
Split it in three, brother.
Okay.
Why should we take that statue home?
Help me, it's heavy.
Ambar, let's go.
Ambar, Dika, let's go.
Ambar, let's go.
Ambar?
Let's go, Ambar.
Fasting till the last day feels so good.
Maybe we need a screwdriver.
It's for the sores.
Thank you.
There, it's opened.
What is this?
What is this, bro?
Not bad.
Many things.
What is that?
Like the one there?
But why it's called a plate? Strange.
It is an old term.
She's pretty, right?
Whose things are those?
The owner must be a Dutchman who lived here.
Don't take someone's belonging.
Especially if it belongs to someone from long time ago.
It might have something in it.
Ani, watch your mouth.
Do you still believe in those things?
What if there is something in it?
I understand, it's you who doesn't understand.
- Stop it, please. - Calm down, grandma.
Tomorrow is Eid.
She knows that and yet she got mad.
- It made them fight. - Yes, my bad.
Do you know that song, Dika?
Head, shoulder...
...knees and toes.
Right.
Let's all dance.
Come on, Ambar.
Let's dance!
Let's dance.
It's fun!
What happened?
Agus?
Check it outside.
Maybe the fuse tripped.
It's okay, Dika.
What is this?
Come on.
Are the neighbors' light also out?
I will check it out.
It's usual for a secluded place like ours.
How can this happen on Eid night?
How come?
Ambar, do you miss mom and dad?
I do. Very much.
How about you?
Me too.
I hope you like it here.
There is a scary well in the backyard.
Really?
Yes, a well.
You don't see anything strange?
No.
I didn't see anything.
I think that song was strange.
Let's not talk about it.
Go to sleep.
Grandpa?
Grandma?
I'm sorry, dear.
I'm sorry.
Is it cooked?
Almost.
I will wake up at three.
I'm very sleepy.
Is everybody asleep?
But I haven't checked Ambar's room.
It's Ambar again and again.
Don't be mad.
Since when you have a sister?
Did you meet her when she's already old?
An imaginary sister?
I like it when you're sulking.
Who is that?
Check it. Quick.
Honey.
Agus?
Rina?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Let's get out of here.
Help!
Help.
What's the matter?
Ambar?
Ambar?
The light was on.
Nothing. Come on.
Rina?
Ida?
Rina?
Agus?
Agus?
Rina?
Agus?
Agus?
Yes, dear?
Calm down. There is another meal.
Ambar, Dika. Please sit down.
I think it wasn't this messy yesterday.
I woke up at dawn, but then I slept again.
We didn't go for the Eid prayer.
Did you wake up again?
Did you wake up?
Did anybody call last night?
The intercom sounded?
The light was out.
But the intercom sounded.
What is it?
What is this statue?
Why is it here?
So strange.
You did this, right?
Maybe...
Don't tell me...
This...
What is this statue?
No, it's not me.
Arthur, don't be kidding.
Impossible. It was raining last night.
There is no way that statue can walk by itself.
Grandpa!
Don't fight now.
Remember, it's still Eid today.
Agus, take it back, will you?
Ambar.
Apparently, this is a diary of a Dutch woman.
She used to live here.
Her parents loved Indonesia and its people.
They even gave an Indonesian name to her youngest brother.
Tragedy came to the family.
Her brother was murdered.
Her father committed suicide.
Poor woman.
Have you seen strange things in this house?
Ambar has never told anyone about this.
Since I had eye surgery...
...that nobody can see.
Last night I saw something.
...I could see clearly this time.
...I heard that Dutch song on the intercom.
Then I saw the Dutch woman.
Keep it up, grandma. Beautiful!
One, two, three.
Very beautiful, grandma.
It's okay.
Please sit.
Come here, Dika.
It's ketupat!
Sit with grandma.
Rina, Agus, let's take a picture.
Come on, gather up!
Let's take a picture.
Smile!
One, two, three.
One more time.
Where is Grandma Ani?
You're right.
I thought you have checked.
Let's take another picture.
Look here, all of you.
Look here and smile as usual.
One, two, three.
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma?
Is Grandma Ani here?
I'm so scared.
Arthur, help us find her.
Let's go.
Grandma!
You go that way, grandma.
Grandma!
Check in there.
Grandma!
Grandma Ani!
Grandma Ani?
Grandma?
Grandma Ani?
Grandma?
Grandma Ani?
Grandma?
Grandma?
Grandma Ani?
Grandma Ani?
Grandma...
Who is that? Let's go.
Hurry up!
Grandma Ani?
Grandma Ani!
Don't you feel strange?
But it's strange indeed.
Come, I'm right here.
Just be calm.
Promise me, Ambar.
That we will leave this place...
...if you see strange things.
We will be fine.
Agus, open the door. Grandma wants to go.
Grandma, just stay inside. It's raining outside.
Agus, open it up!
Open it!
Arthur, be patient please.
So open the door now!
Stop it!
I don't feel safe here, grandpa.
Where will you go? What will you ride?
You cannot bring your grandma like this.
This is not only about you.
This is about my family.
My responsibility.
We will wait here.
I have called the police.
Agus.
Agus.
I don't feel safe here.
Please open the door.
Grandma, the police will come shortly.
You must not walk so far.
Please.
Come on.
Listen.
Believe it!
And what if the killer is still here?
Arthur!
I want to go home.
Yes, grandma. It won't be long.
That statue. Did somebody move it?
Are you kidding?
Look.
I know you're the one who brought the statue here, right?
Right?
Listen.
Just think of it.
And I wasn't kidding, that statue wasn't there just now.
Enough!
Last night the Dutch song suddenly played on the intercom.
I saw that Dutch woman in the kitchen.
You saw it?
What do you mean by that?
Just stop it, Ambar.
I have never seen anything strange while I'm here.
Good evening. I'm from Cimaju Police station.
Did somebody call?
My condolences.
I'm sorry to come late. It is the rain.
It's alright, Mr. Yudi.
Yes.
Have you called for the ambulance?
The deceased grandma...
That?
Are you okay?
HQ? I need back up.
Who is this?
Let me see.
His name was Matsuya.
Damn!
Hey!
Who's there?
It looks like Matsuya was close to the Dutch woman.
Poor woman.
Maybe the killer is still in the vicinity.
Ambar.
Let's just stay here.
But it's not safe here.
Just listen to them.
The statue.
Maybe somebody shuts the light on purpose.
...and lock every door.
Come with me.
That's what I'm telling you all. No one believes me.
I should not be here.
Everybody, take a rest.
What's the matter, Dika?
The statue, it moved.
It stood up.
Why is the gramophone on?
Ambar?
Come, quickly!
Don't make a sound.
<i>We have to go out now.</i>
Ambar?
How come it's on?
<i>Let's go now.</i>
Ambar.
Please help!
What are you doing?
Let her go!
Grandpa, what's going on?
That woman is hit and dragged away.
Let go!
<i>Please go now!</i>
What is that sound?
No matter what, she is Dutch.
Damn you all!
...by our people.
By the native people.
Don't move!
Don't move!
Show her...
...that we are more powerful than their people.
They have made you suffer for hundreds of years.
What's that, Ambar?
...to help you all.
But...
They want you dead.
Your love toward them...
Each drop of my blood...
...will make your life miserable.
I'm afraid.
Here, stay with me.
It's off!
<i>Bastards!</i>
Whose voice is that?
Ambar?
<i>Ambar?</i>
<i>Where are you going?</i>
<i>Ambar?</i>
Ambar.
Where are you going?
Use the umbrella.
Ambar!
Wait up!
Be careful!
Ambar.
What are you doing here?
He went inside.
What is this?
Bring grandma in, Dika.
What's going on?
He went here.
Who is he?
What is this room?
Ambar can see things that happened in the past.
What is that?
It is the shadow that we saw upstairs.
Why is it on?
I will always savor your mom's dishes.
I will always remember how your mom and dad loved us.
But...
...your love for this country...
...made you suffer instead.
What is that, Ambar?
He made her into a statue.
So is the statue upstairs?
I will always remember you.
Forgive me.
Every drop of your blood will make their life uneasy.
What do you see, Ambar?
What's the matter?
What's the matter, Ambar?
Damn you all!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Ambar, why did the chair fall?
It wasn't like this, right?
Be careful, sir.
So strange.
What's that?
Let's go upstairs!
Go, all of you!
Let's go upstairs!
Hurry up, go upstairs!
Agus!
Rina!
- Quickly! - Agus!
Hurry up!
Everybody, get into my car!
Quickly, everybody!
- Rina, let's go! - I won't leave Agus!
Ambar, quickly!
Run, quickly!
Quick!
It won't start!
Please hurry up!
What's going on?
Quick, start the car!
<i>Every drop of my blood...</i>
<i>Return my head!</i>
That! She's behind us!
She's coming towards us!
<i>Return my head!</i>
She's gone!
Lock the door!
Lock it!
Grandma!
Ida!
I can't open it!
Help!
Grandma!
Arthur!
Grandma...
Grandma!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur...
What must we do?
She wants our heads.
Maybe we should destroy the statue?
Quickly!
Let's destroy it!
Now!
What is it, Ambar?
That Japanese soldier...
Ambar!
Dika!
Be careful.
He dumped her head here.
Take that axe.
- Alcohol? - There's no time for discussion, quick!
Quick!
What is that?
Ambar is right.
The jerrycan.
Quick.
Take that!
Come on!
Where's the match?
Burn it!
Damn! It's in the car!
Quickly, sir!
Get the match in the kitchen!
Dika! Ambar!
Dika, Ambar! Wait there!
Dika!
Dika! Rina!
Ambar!
Dika!
Dika, Ambar!
Dika!
Ambar!
Dika.
Where are you?
Dika...
Where are you?
Dika!
Ambar!
Dika!
Throw the match!
Throw the match, Rina!
Dika! Ambar!
Ambar! Dika!
Ambar!
Ambar...
Return my head!
Dika...
Ambar!
Ambar!
Ambar!
Ambar?
Ambar.
Are you alright?
Ambar!
Hey, are you alright?
Help will come, calm down.
<i>One week later</i>
Yes.
But since that incident there are only a few who live here.
Luckily there are survivors.
We are moving to another location.
Grandpa.
Let me see.
Dimas, Elizabeth, Ivanna.
Let's go, grandpa.
Good morning.
Stop!
Go left!
Help him, dammit.
- Stop. - Easy now. Calm down!
- What's going on? - He's bleeding.
Easy now.
Ali?
Tell him I'm a doctor and here to help him.
I can't examine him if he doesn't open his mouth.
No, no, don't swallow! Open your mouth!
Eva, if you say we should cancel, we will.
Keep him calm.
Yes, I saw it. Not very big.
He's breathing normally.
Okay. Thanks. Bye.
The blade is dulled by the gastric acid and cannot harm his organs.
It looks dramatic, but it's not dangerous.
Sure?
Yes. We have a green light.
- Good morning. - Welcome on board.
Come on. Relax.
Ahmed, it's easier if you co-operate.
Relax.
Take a deep breath.
- and put your seat back in an upright position.
What's going on?
To Gustav.
He sent it to half the school.
He made a bet with Arthur that he could make you do it.
You look perky.
Okay, settle down.
Let's all settle down.
Thank you.
Did you all do that?
- Yes. - Good. Let's hear some of them.
Villads.
'The roads neatly embracing each other as engagements.'
- that have settled in me in past months.'
'I am only here by necessity. It was the only option.'
Will you share with us why you picked that passage?
I just thought it was kinda cool.
You need to come up with a bit more than 'cool' at your Danish exam.
Well, it's gross and kinda zombie-ish.
Yes, let's hear from someone else.
Emil.
Settle down. Emil, what did you choose?
Calm down.
He kicked Thomsen's tray and spilt coffee all over him.
Let me go check.
- May I? - Nice. That's really great.
Take a deep breath and calm down.
You're bleeding, but it's not dangerous. It'll pass on its own in a few days.
You're strong. You're gonna be okay.
Don't worry. Nothing happened. I'm okay.
Nothing happened.
I don't understand!
- Are you okay? - Yes, yes. I'm fine.
Hang on. Why aren't you in school?
I'm back.
How does she feel about that? Oh.
That's just not okay. Oh, hang on.
Emil?
Oh, no!
Laura.
It's sea foam.
When it's windy there are bubbles in the water.
Pretty little hand.
You got that from me.
So much.
Come.
Relax.
Calm down now.
Sit down and relax.
- Come on. - Calm down. Easy now.
- Wanna hear what I'm thinking? - What are you thinking?
If they can't make it work, then who the hell can?
We've done a lot for them.
Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives so their children can go to school -
We've poured billions into their country.
But they don't wanna live there.
We're at work. I'm glad you're here.
Go easy on the water, sweetie.
There are no shops around here.
Come on. We're on a trip.
We could go as far as we wanted.
Are we allowed to do that?
Great idea. It's right out there.
Sausage is your favourite.
Not so much anymore.
Come.
What are you doing here?
Need a ride?
I'm on my way to a farm to pick up some chickens.
For real.
That's a lot of eggs in a week.
What happened in class today?
You didn't return.
No.
What was that business with Gustav and Arthur?
Have you fallen out?
But you also hang out with Frederikke, right?
Yes.
She's a sweet girl.
What are your plans after secondary school?
My parents think I should go to high school.
What do you think?
I just wanna get away from here.
Not... a hard time.
It's just weird.
We live in the same house.
And they don't know how I'm doing.
But I can feel how worried they are.
Her last name. Amber.
Andersen.
Amber Valentina Hernandez Andersen.
Her mother was Chilean.
Amber Valentina Hernandez Andersen.
That name really doesn't fit someone who's dead.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
It's just the nausea. I should've eaten something.
As soon as it's over we'll find something to eat.
Okay?
Is that her husband and children?
So...
Do you recognize anyone?
It's been years.
Yes.
Ihram.
Ihram.
My name is Eva. I'm a doctor.
I've lived in Denmark for eight years. I speak Danish.
Sorry. My mistake.
That would be kinda silly.
I'm not sending anyone anywhere.
- Other people made that decision. - And you trust them?
Ihram, I'm here because it's part of the Hippocratic oath -
Would it be better if I wasn't here?
May I?
You'll feel a little prick.
Yes, I have a 17-year-old daughter.
I just turned 18.
Congratulations.
So I'm an adult now.
That's why they're sending me back.
I've lived in Denmark since I was ten -
And that that is where I belong.
Hey, Henrik! Stop that one, would you?
Do you want it?
No.
Thanks. They take off in all directions.
Come.
Do you find that problematic?
Well then, cheers.
Welcome.
What do you think?
It tastes... different.
A good Riesling always gets a hint of petrol flavour as it matures.
That's how you recognize the really good ones.
But there are also notes of ripe fruit. Can you taste it?
Once you've gotten through the initial and more penetrating notes.
Apricot?
Peach... what?
Come. Take me.
Come on, harder. Like that, yeah.
What the hell was that?
I don't know. Come on, keep going. Yes...
It's so good. You're so strong!
Wait here.
Hi. I'm Hanne. Owner of the house.
- Hi, hi. - Hi, hi.
- Hanne. - Hi, Hanne. Vîyan.
- We're pleased enough. - Do you cook?
Look.
No heat in my hand.
And when you lift it back up, it stops.
No, I don't think so.
Then just carry on enjoying each other's company.
The day after we got the key he collapsed.
On the kitchen floor.
Right there.
- Yes, very sad. - Love should be treasured.
Yes.
Yes...
So that was Hanne.
Did you come.
No... no.
Phew. I'm all exhausted from crying.
- I'm Lotte. - Maja.
- Yes, I'm pregnant. - Well, you look very slim otherwise.
Wonderful. I have two myself.
It's Simon, my husband.
Excuse me...
He went to high school with Amber.
Yes, that tends to happen with high school friendships.
It's so meaningless. Being ripped away like that.
Yes.
I'm about to cry again.
Are you okay?
- Let's ditch the funeral gathering. - Okay.
It's up to you.
We just said hi.
There, you look respectable again now.
Very nice.
That's too bad.
- Come. I wanna show you something. - What?
Just come. Come.
Come on! Come!
Sit down.
I have something for you.
Go on. You must get off the plane.
Throw him off the plane.
Go on, get out. Do what I tell you.
Get him out!
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
Hi, sweetie.
Are you coming?
I talked to Dad.
We agreed you could stay with me till tomorrow, perhaps even longer.
In the cabin.
What cabin?
Auntie's.
Is it far?
Kiss you here and here and here.
And here and here and here.
But the body only uses the brain to start and stop motion.
You stink! You know?!
Wanna see something beautiful?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
You can't really bring a packed lunch to church, you know.
Wait here.
Maja.
Jump in.
Hey...
I don't really think we...
Thank you.
That's really nice of you. It's not something one can ask for.
There.
It's constant. 'Don't push Ingvild, and don't speak to her in a harsh voice.'
That sounds exhausting. It must be hard on you.
- Language creates reality. - Mm.
How exciting.
Yes.
That I'm a writer.
But you are.
That's just how you make a living.
Yes, when I don't make films.
Let's find something for you two to eat.
Come.
There's a light spread.
Please dig in. It's there for the taking.
What a beautiful day. Entirely in Amber's spirit.
Entirely in Amber's spirit.
Seawater and lemon.
Eat your oyster.
Is it true what they say about oysters?
I don't know. What do they say?
You're a naughty one, aren't you.
Come.
Show me what you got! Like that. Do it hard.
Ah, it's so good.
- Goddammit! - Never mind. Go on.
Keep going. Come, come, come. Come on.
Come, give me your milk.
Goddammit!
- Bomshi-bomshi. - Bomshi?
- Perhaps the young lady? - Come in, why don't you.
Oh, yes. They're mine. I didn't even realize.
Thank you.
It just all seems a bit off. Fishy.
That's quite an accusation.
But you have nothing to worry about.
Adam and I have been together for... 11 years?
And with a fulltime job and three kids the magic can get lost, you know?
Then we have 24 hours of talking and drinking wine and... yes.
Yes.
Well, then I don't want to spoil the fun.
- Why did you do that? - Do what?
Tell her such a long and detailed story about us.
Yeah, sure.
I know who you are.
I think you should grab your boyfriend and get out of here.
Simon shouldn't be here.
Have you seen Simon, my husband?
Okay.
Get lost!
What's going on?
I met the red-haired woman in the bathroom.
Why would she say that?
Simon, why did she say that?
But I want you to consider why you want to know.
Isn't it amazing?
It usually helps.
This one is something very special.
I'm thirsty.
Can I help you?
I don't have any money.
Okay...
I was just at a funeral.
I left my purse.
What would you like?
Something to drink?
That'll be... 100 kroner.
Who was buried?
Someone my husband went to high school with.
I never met her.
Ketchup or French dressing?
French.
and tripped and hit her head.
What they expected to be eternity has ceased to be...
Are you married?
Yes. We got married three weeks ago in my in-laws' allotment garden.
It rained all day.
When the ceremony was over the entire lawn was flooded.
People were totally soaked.
I had to bite my cheek to stop myself from crying.
My mother-in-law said that even the rain had come to celebrate us.
He's seven years older than me, Simon.
And now we're having a baby.
Can't we just call Dad and ask him to come get us?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about the time you swallowed a bee?
You cried and cried.
Then your lips started turning blue.
So we called an ambulance.
So I ran into the house, grabbed a knife and stuck it in.
I'd read about it in a book. I didn't know if it would work.
But when the ambulance finally got there the doctor said -
- that you would've been dead if I hadn't done it.
You'd swallowed a bee. It stung your throat.
Come.
Jump up on my back. Here we go.
He's in Barcelona with some friends.
I do it all the time, so there's nothing odd about that.
About... 22 years ago.
Time changes a lot of things.
I've never done this before. I want you to know that.
I'd seen you at the buffet.
- You'd seen me? - Yes.
No, I ditched it.
Stop.
It was about...
Constantly optimizing -
- expanding...
Instead, we should stop for a minute...
I just need to find the key.
There's usually a key...
Where do we usually put... the key?
Wait here. It's probably in the shed.
Shall I take your trash?
Yes.
It's just a small scratch.
He'll just worry if we call him now. You know what he's like.
You know it wasn't on purpose, what happened back then, right?
It wasn't.
Let's get something to eat.
You can come now.
Come.
Come!
We won't steal or break anything, and we're not making porn.
You need to leave us alone, okay?
I saw the pictures, and the lady in the pictures sure isn't this one.
I can't really find anything on you.
Will you please leave?
Lying speaks volumes about someone's character.
Listen...
Adam.
Adam!
What are you doing here? Where are the kids?
Should I have brought them here, perhaps?
My sister's with them, so don't paint this as if I'm the irresponsible one.
- So who's she? - Vîyan.
I'm Hanne, and she's Vîyan.
So you meet up with my husband in some stranger's cabin and have sex or ...?
I'm sorry.
- We met at a conference... - I never meant to hurt anyone.
Oh, okay.
So, you're cheating, too?
No.
- Now I'm confused. - Yes...
It... I'm not out to steal your husband.
He's really not my type and...
And well... we're not that great a match sexually either.
Good genes.
- I'm sorry, I don't follow. - She wants your baby, Adam.
No... No. You said you had it under control.
I'm sorry.
We had an agreement! You can't just change it... and then ...!
People gotta be able to trust one another, goddammit!
Ladies and gentlemen. The crew will now prepare for landing.
Yes.
Maja...
Back when I knew Amber...
in high school...
- for who you are now.
Emil?
He said he couldn't reach you.
Right...
Sweetie...
Your bath is ready.
It's nice and warm.
Honey, wake up and have breakfast.
You'll be late for work.
Honey!
What the...
What's that!
Honey, what's this!
Holy cow...
Who did I drink with...
I didn't drink much.
Pollack soup...
- You could open a diner. - Jeez...
Min-woo's not eating?
He's under the weather.
I wanted him to sleep in.
Yeah?
If it gets worse, I'll take him to a clinic here.
Dad.
Hey, good morning.
Okay.
When you're better, let's go to the amusement park.
- Promise. - Promise.
Get some more sleep.
You have to get better.
<i>Hankook Hospital</i>
I'm so starving.

So keep your dick inside.
I'll castrate you next time.

<i>It's due to her attack on a sexual predator,</i>

Short rib soup on me.
- Hurry, hurry. - Short rib soup sounds so good.
Good day, Chief Prosecutor Lim.
You got appetite to eat short rib soup right now?!
You all are the same.
Everyone, come with me!
Is Min-woo okay?
I don't know why Young-ju's causing so much trouble.
She's coming by this weekend,
so give her a good scolding.

I'm going to be late today,
Okay.
Min-woo, you're not sick anymore?
Nope! I'm not sick at all!
Don't be sick.

I'm sorry, you can't go any further.

So, what happened?
Tae-hoon, should I talk to her?
No, I'll do it myself.
Thank you.
Let's go to my office.
We can talk there.
See this white region.
as a rock.
What?
what's the treatment?
Can it be treated?
Min-woo.
Mom's here.
Could you look at me?
Honey, can I see him inside?
Gil-ju, it's not possible right now.
Min-woo,
Oh no...
I'm fine.
I'm just going to pick up a few things for him.
So watch over him until then.
I'll be back.
Min-woo will love this.
<i>Gil-ju, it's me!</i>
Gil-ju, I'm here!
Min-woo,
Eh?
Are you in here?
Gil-ju!
Hey! Wake up!

Why are you like this?
You said you'd be back...

<i>Funeral Home</i>
<i>Deceased: Han Gil-ju</i>
My deepest condolences.
What was the cause?
Pulmonary fibrosis, same as Min-woo.
2/3 of her lungs...
She didn't look sick at all.
It looks to be at least a year...
Wait a minute.
At least a year?
Even if it's an acute form,
it can't progress that rapidly.
but she and I had a full check-up 5 months ago here,
<i>Radiology</i>
You were right.
We can't send her off like this.
April 3, 2011.
Current time, 11:30 a.m.
I'll now begin the autopsy.
How's this possible...
We received a report this morning
that it was not a specific virus.
There was some inflammation near the bronchus.
Only the alveolus
connected to the bronchial tubes were damaged.
So there's a high likelihood that a foreign agent
entered the respiratory system.
and I found a doctor who discovered and studied
Yeah? Who?
Dr. Oh Jong-hak from Jungang Hospital.
Yes, that's correct.
<i>Medical Journal "Unknown Pulmonary Fibrosis"</i>
Yes, who might you be?
I'm Jung Tae-hoon, a fellow alumnus.
I hope instant coffee is okay.
Yes, thank you.
This is my son.
Acute pulmonary fibrosis?
That's right, sir.
It started in 2006 or so.
I thought it was common cold at first.
Common cold?!
Tell me the truth!
What did you do to my child?!
Tell me!
<i>It was quite strange.</i>
Had we conducted a proper epidemiologic survey...
A survey was done on pulmonary fibrosis?
Yes, but it didn't go well.
What was the reason?
Weird thing was,
Only in the spring?
Yes, spring.
<i>April Medical Records</i>
This really is weird.
Over 80% of all cases.
The rest was discovered later,
but had early signs in the spring too.
What for?
if we conduct a survey.
<i>Sender: Jung Tae-hoon</i>
- Hello, Ms. Park Ye-in? - Yes.
What happened to the survey?
Did anything come up?
It's not easy.
We didn't get a single reply.
I'd like to ask you
Baby stuff is left intact.
Possibility will be greater if we dig deep into it.
When did your granddaughter become sick?
Last spring.
She collapsed while training,
Are you all right?
Yes.
But I can still hold on.
Please find the cause, Ms. Han.
I feel so bad...
Ma'am.
Most are for common cold.
Ji-young and I always had cold.
Did any of your family members or relatives
No, not at all.
I see.
Sure, please follow me?
Okay.
Give me the camera, I'll go in alone.
Okay.
Ji-young, can you hear me?
Would it be okay if I took some photos?
She says it's okay, feel free to take them.
Thank you.
<i>Sorry for lashing out, lately I feel weird</i>
<i>Could it be menopause</i>
<i>Thank you and love you always</i>
Fried rice is in the fridge,
warm it up for dinner.
You could do that, right?
Yes, my home is quite dry.
Never raised any kids?
Why. Something wrong?
No, not at all.

We remained faithful to conditions you provided
as we carried out the experiment.

No. We have found some traces of molds and germs,
Or PHMG for short.
To be precise,
a massive amount was found inside the humidifier.
<i>Spotless?</i>
Honey, what's this?
I saw on the TV
that it prevents molds inside the humidifier.
Good,

Please leave.
Fine! But listen to this.
Sure, sure.
What did you say?

Yeah, it's me.
Halting sale and seizure will be difficult.
Here are 2 things we know.
and it's possible to transmit through respiratory system.
We can conclude 2 things from Dr. Oh's data.
New cases pop up in the spring,
Then why did their fathers not contracted the disease?
so as to not disturb their pregnant wives or children.
We conducted an epidemiologic survey
based on these data points,
The cause was PHMG,

Get the lab to send over all related files.
<i>Toxicity test of Spotless must be done</i>
<i>The main component PHMG may pose danger to human body</i>
Woo-sik.
Of Korea's 50 million population,
Over 10 million, perhaps.
We sold at least that much.
Just a few did.
Woo-sik.
as the Asian head.
Do this right.
Yes, I understand.
Woo-sik!
Welcome, sir.
Councilman.
We drank too much in broad daylight.
Good day, sir.
O2 will cover your campaign
It's not just about that,
but O2 never did anything wrong.
Hey, hey!
You call this an article?
I haven't been here in so long, but it feels so comfortable.
Han Young-ju is in your team, is this correct?
That's right, councilman.
That's not proven yet.
All right, that's enough.
Where did you find a spot like this?
What?
How could I not act on it?
Of course not.
I can't believe this,
they really are incredible.
Did something happen?
They lawyered up too.
Ryu Sang-moon?
You know him?
and he's their hottest lawyer.
isn't that a big disadvantage for us?
Don't worry.
We can find a rightful opposition.
Yes.
They must be after favoritism
the court and the prosecution will side with him.
But if you stand on our side,
But why me?
'Do not walk away from injustice,
so long as I stand here,
no one can violate the law.'
That's what I said?
Send me the files first.
I brought it with me just in case.
Not at all.
I hope I didn't put you in a tough spot by asking you.
It didn't work out?
I knew it was a long shot.
This is bad.
we aren't much help.
Is this Ms. Han Young-ju's office?
Ms. Han!
Congratulations on opening your firm!
What took you so long?
I was about to get mad?
Have you had dinner?
There's a great steak house around the corner, shall we?
Steak? It feels like I'm being baited...?
Of course not.
This...
Ma'am, please sign it here.
Did you bring your seal?
Please go over there.
I received calls from 20-30 people today.
Good morning.
The prosecution has not shown
any sign of investigating this case
but to be honest,
have you heard of the Minamata incident?
and took 50 years, but in the end,
I don't care how long it takes.
I will fight those scumbags till the end.
But,
suing them will cost a lot of money,
I really can't afford to pay,
You don't need to worry.
that we're short on.
Be careful with that.
<i>August</i>
Have plenty.
It's really good.
So good.
<i>August</i>
Jeez...
What riled you up now?
By the way,
I see.
But this is a civil case
The trial may not be held.
Not be held? Really?
Excuse me.
What happened? You said it wouldn't go to trial.
An American national and her child died.
Why did Americans die here.
This has to be dealt with here.
Find a way.
Yes, sir.
<i>Court</i>
Good day.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
I'm not sure
All rise.
We'll now begin the combined trial of 2011-4725,
Plaintiff.
Defense.
Your Honors,
our main chair attorney has not arrived yet.
Here he comes.
My sincere apologies for being late.
The traffic was terrible.
and 3 co-chairs representing O2.
My apologies for making you wait.
$1 million, was it?
We will now begin the trial.
Plaintiff, you may begin.
Your Honors,
Yes, go ahead.
Thank you.
On behalf of O2,
I'd like to sincerely apologize to you all
But O2 is not a corporation that creates harmful products.
to conduct a toxicity testing.
Your Honors,
I object, Your Honors.
by delaying this trial
A question for the defense.
at current situation.
But this has been in the making for a very long time.
This is a list of victims who have settled.
- Unconditional settlement? - Yes, that's correct.
I don't know who they are, but it breaks my heart.
This is $100,000.
What do you take me for?
- Defense. - Yes, Your Honors.
When will the result for the toxicity test come out?
We plan to rush it
Since O2 is voluntarily settling with the victims,
We will continue the trial after Dr. Chu Sung-mo's team
The court is adjourned.
No! Your Honors!
Good work.
Your Honors! Please!
- Great job. - You as well.
could you elaborate?
A beloved 17-year old product
after the test.
Not at all, thank you.
Ms. Han!
What did you say?
I'm going to go see...
And do what?
Mr. Han Hyun-jong.
I thought you took a lot of money,
just look at you.
Because of my twins...
and my wife's hospital bills...
from family and friends.
These kind folks...
Yeah...
I sold off my twins...
and settled.
So don't come by anymore.
That's why!
This is my last warning.
Transition to LLC has completed as of today.
And current settlement rate is at 32%.
What's the plaintiff up to?
Expert? Who?
it's not an easy decision to go against O2.
Very well,
Second trial date is next week.
O2 made a very dangerous product.
Are you trying to bargain with O2?
No, no, don't be mistaken.
Bring it.
This is a 5-year exclusive agreement
<i>Research Exclusivity Agreement</i>
between O2 and your lab for all of our testings.
And this is...
we will take necessary actions against you.
Run your tests again.
Okay.
Is there another problem?
Shouldn't you look into that?
Sorry about that.
Good morning, please take a look...
Excuse me.
How did it go?
<i>It'll be possible.</i>
Understood, good work.
Thank you.
Please read this only once for us.
Who are you? Take your hands off?
I thought his hose came loose.
Why are you in here?
Need a new pair of lungs for him?
Give me a call, I'll be waiting outside.
<i>If we wait any longer, even that will be difficult.</i>
I'm sorry, Min-woo,
I just can't agree to this.
That's their strategy.
I do solemnly and truly declare that the evidence I shall give
is the truth and nothing but the truth.
Plaintiff, you may question the witness.
Prof. Jang Tae-sung,
you stated that toxicity in a chemical substance
How could it vary?
Toxicity of a chemical is divided
So depending on person and circumstances,
it will vary.
For example,
but when inhaled or swallowed,
it may prove very fatal to someone.
Yes, that's correct.
It is unthinkable that a poison like PHMG was used
That is all.
Professor,
as an expert in the chemistry field,
Yes, that's right.
As a member of Ministry of Environment's
This is a reference book published by
This was written by you.
Witness, please read.
Polyhexamethylene guanidine is not harmful to human body.
That's right.
Back then, the reference book...
Do not make statements you can't take back!
Do you understand?
I object! The defense is...
That is all.
Prof. Chu Sung-mo,
this is your lab's inhalation toxicity report.
After conducting a thorough toxicity test
is the cause of problems
The result of an animal testing confirms that PHMG level
to pulmonary fibrosis.
This is my lab's conclusion.
So, Spotless did not cause the lung illness.
Is it correct?
Yes, that's correct.
What's going on?
Plaintiff,
Yes.
Prof. Chu Sung-mo.
for the past 3 years,
Yes, that's right.
Objection.
by stating a personal opinion.
Plaintiff, be careful.
We were concerned for that when we were contracted.
that our test process and results are impartial
and fair.
That's right.
Is that true?
Doctor, Doctor!
What's going on?
Silence!
Could you please step forward?
Are you Dr. Jung Tae-hoon?
That's right.
I'll ask once more,
Yes,
it's the truth.
The process was fair
and the results are sound.
Spotless has nothing to do
with pulmonary fibrosis.
Dr. Jung, what are you doing?
How could you...
Dr. Jung!
What the hell are you talking about?!
That's not true!
Tell me why...
It can't be!
How could this happen?
You'll receive a call from Dr. Chu
Do not waver at the result
and side with O2.
That's...
We have proven that a despicable group of people
on deaths of their family
by putting blame on an honorable corporation.
Twice! You know!
Do it until the end!
I'm sorry,
they were adamant about keeping it a secret.
It's all in the past now.
You've seen the tests
and you said it's all true.
Yeah, that's right.
We've cleared our name
still believe Spotless is to blame,
it saddens me to no end.
Do you have any plans to sue them for damages?
Well,
Please, Sir!
You can't take that!
Please!
Ji-young...
don't get sick
It's great.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations!
This is all thanks to you.
I have one more thing to announce,
- Congratulations! - Congrats!
Congratulations.
- Woo-sik. - Yes, sir
How much Spotless stock do we still have?
About $30 million worth, sir.
I'll have them destroyed.
Are you nuts? That'd be a waste.
Push it out within a month.
Put them back on the market?
Got a problem with that?
What if more people die...
Don't worry, people don't die so easily.
And what if some do.
Get rid of them in a month,
Then this problem will be buried for good.
Right away, sir.
Have a drink.
You did good.
Thank you.
Freaking morons...
I really love this country.
If you got money, everyone will bow.
Did you know? I'm a British citizen.
Yes, I knew.
I'm just here to make money.
Does it offend you because you're a Korean?
Not at all, sir.
Come to Malaysia after the stock's gone,
Sure.
Head back in.
Yes, who are you?
Police.
Please come with us.
Can't you see this?
You're on the no-fly list as of today.
What?
<i>CEO Seo Woo-sik</i>
Sir, we got a big problem.
You should turn on the news.
All right, leave me.
<i>and plans to bring him in for a full investigation.</i>
<i>I'm Min-ji's dad,</i>
<i>Honey, my necktie.</i>
I'm sorry, honey.
You said it's an important meeting, right.
Yeah, I made an appointment.
Good.
What did she want?
I'll buy it over lunch.
Let me see her for a bit before heading out.
No, she fell asleep just now.
Just for a bit.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
This is Seo Woo-sik.
It's an acute pulmonary fibrosis.
What about my daughter?
Where's Min-ji now?
No!
No! Min-ji!
No! Please!
Min-ji...
No, God loved her so much, He took her away early.
No!
<i>I'd like to take a break.</i>
But do me this favor.
It's about Spotless' Australian export.
Could you finish that up?
Thank you.
<i>The Australian health authority</i>
<i>has not authorized the product.</i>
<i>By the way</i>
<i>I cannot believe that.</i>
Min-ji's dad.
Yes.
I'm Min-ji's dad,
<i>They are the devil.</i>
They will sacrifice people
<i>As you know, there aren't any legal hurdles</i>
<i>for production and sale of the disinfectant.</i>
Thank you for coming.
Say hello, this is Dr. Chu Sung-mo.
Good to meet you.
We're on the same side now.
<i>There was only one way</i>
<i>Let the world know</i>
<i>of their real crime ourselves.</i>
<i>This should not go to civil trial.</i>
<i>This is a crime of murder.</i>
I have one good news, and one bad news,
which would you like first?
Let's start with the good news?
My boy Min-woo will receive a legal lung transplant.
Thank you.
What's the bad news...
This is indeed a terrible news?
- One moment. - Sure.
I'm so happy for you.
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.
Right now?
Don't you worry.
Why are you in here?
What?
He said I was perfect for taking out the trash
Trash and British thug?
You punk!
Shall we sit down first.
Let's see...
This is pretty simple?
You knowingly sold a toxic product,
then fabricated evidence when caught.
Wait! Don't drink that!
What the hell are you doing!
He's not going to die.
O2 doesn't make products like that.
Am I right, Mr. Cho?
That moron.
Have you been well?
I miss you...
more than ever today.
Mom...
Mom...
Mom...
I'm hungry.
<i>since the humidifier disinfectant scandal.</i>
<i>has been formed by the government</i>
We'll now begin
and their families here at the congress.
we will first watch a video of the victims' testimonies.
<i>At first...</i>
<i>the hospital said</i>
<i>They said my home shouldn't be dry</i>
<i>The TV said I should use it,</i>

Technology and Standards Agency,
what did you feel when watching that video?
A lot more people have suffered
because of your certification.
We, Technology and Standards Agency,
You're not responsible?
We certified it in accordance with the law and regulation,
They got it certified as a detergent
how is that not a problem?
We deal with products
As per Toxic Substance Control Law,
- Did I hear that right? - How long have you served?
and go for lunch, okay?
Let's take a photo.
You are all incredible.
How are you all so high and almighty?
You people allowed it to be sold.
How could no one take responsibility for it?
Are you really civil servants?
Isn't it your job to protect the public?!

This morning.
Three duels in three hours with three musketeers!
Let's drink to your peace.
<i>Constance…</i>
<i>Beware of love, d'Artagnan.</i>
Have you loved yourself?
<i>She was so beautiful, so pure...</i>
The woman was on the run.
<i>Who do you work for, madam?</i>
<i>The devil himself, probably.</i>
<i>I see the sparkle in your eyes, d'Artagnan.</i>
We will create a republic of Protestants.
<i>We will strike the kingdom to the heart.</i>
Agree.
By the will of the Lord.
Constance!
D'Artagnan!
Our prisoners, Brandicourt and Bremont,
killed in their cell.
When did it happen?
This morning, monsieur.
No…
And that's not all: Abbé Rougon, whom we wanted to interrogate has disappeared...
Your Majesty...
I beg you: Do not leave Paris, until he is exposed.
But not fulfilling it.
Feed Abbe Rougon to the dogs!
Thanks to you, the king declared war on the Protestants.
Yes. Wonderful. Go to the kitchen. You will be fed.
Did Mayol interrogate her?
And I don't want to know.
Live up, brothers! Live up!
Do not make noise.
Do it!
Constance?
Keys!
Anxiety! Anxiety!
What's happened?
Upstairs!
They are coming.
Give me the dagger.
Detain them.
The door won't hold. Faster!
Eh!
So what's so important?
I'll try to guess... Tall, in red and with a goatee?
You're not very kind to who saved your life.
It wasn't me you wanted to save, and Constance Bonacieux.
Wait... What?
She was kidnapped because she saw the traitors.
Where is she?
Not yet.
If you don't undress, you'll freeze to death.
Don't worry about me.
I still need you alive.
And only the king wants peace.
And your Richelieu?
Richelieu is the king's nominee...
If the king falls, he too will fall. Why would he want this?
Are you embarrassed, d'Artagnan?
Not really. I... I...
Not at all embarrassed.
Myself?
Or me?
You are very arrogant...
Your eyes…
Your voice…
Your body…
I'm sorry, but my heart... belongs to Constance.
Stop it. Stop it.
I'm not like you.
This one, you know...
So surrender yourself to the darkness!
Stop it... Let me go!
So-so.
Where is she?
Get up!
Hey! Can you hear me, Milady de Winter?
You took with you what that doesn't belong to you!
I give you ten seconds!
So that you return what was stolen to me!
We could have helped.
I didn't hear him bark.
No offense?
No Offense…
Yes.
That's why I came... To say goodbye to you.
God made this choice for me.
The burden that I shift... on your shoulders.
Although you didn't ask for it.
You know, son...
Understand?
If I die,
And wear your name... with pride.
Because one day... you will become Count de la Fère.
Joseph! Jose... Joseph!
Promise you'll come back! Promise!
I promise. I promise.
Two more will fit!
Where is your fourth?
D'Artagnan doesn't understand anything! Quantity does not harm quality!
All clear.
Sir!
What's happened?
It won't fit.
Try it from that side.
Aramis?
You can't be in a monastery!
Porthos?
Understood.
Let's go.
Free? OK then.
Month... third. Right?
And there was... a feast?
Who was on it? Eternal hangers-on?
Bralenge?
No, yellow teeth...
Mortemar! Married to a freak...
Oh no!
Someone from Balestan?
Warrior!
This is a warrior... You have always loved warriors.
I know... Villeneuve de Rady!
Aramis! Aramis!
Get out of the way, hillbilly!
I'm flying...
Athos!
What happened to you, d'Artagnan?
Once… one precious friend told me:
Still no news from... Mademoiselle Bonacieux?
They wanted to kill you.
The one to whom you entrusted your destiny, is far from so simple.
Beware of everyone around you.
Even you?
If it's safer for you.
Your Majesty's brother!
Look at this miracle!
Thank you for entrusting me with the army...
I couldn't wait... Madam...
I Promise…
And I promise to also restore your power...
Go, go. Go to the troops. Until I changed my mind.
Use your feet, work your feet! Your life depends on your feet!
D'Artagnan... calmer. Chalet is no ordinary soldier.
He's a traitor! And I thought the musketeers weren't afraid of anyone.
He has four thousand people.
Yes.
From the same woman who shot you and
M?
Can you read this code?
No, but…
Hm!
Beware, d'Artagnan...
I will take this letter to Captain de Treville.
Not for me...
Stop it.
Stop it... Stop it!
I'm telling you, not for me!
I can't.
You are Athos' wife...
No!
Are you sure she died?
"She"?
I saw...
We have strengthened the ports of Saint-Martin-de-Ré and Oleron...
Our troops are in five camps...
In the West - Champagne and Lorraine
The fortress is surrounded on all sides.
And the British?
If you fight them off, new ones will come after them...
So what is next?
Carcassonne?
By? Castres? Montauban?
We need to show it to everyone.
We have already surrounded the fortress...
Like a ripe fruit.
Where should we send them?
Quiet, quiet! You'll cut off your head!
Here you go... Thank you.
Wait, Aramis!
I'll talk to him about Matilda.
What bastard woke me up?!
This is not good.
I bet you a thousand crowns you challenge him to a duel.
Yes, the main thing is that you have...
And two barrels of gunpowder.
Ask the artillery they may have supplies.
I obey!
And you are not afraid, sir, stand under the cannonballs?
Everyone quickly take cover!
Chevalier d'Herblay, Royal Musketeer.
Surely the famous Aramis himself! Continue.
A gentle breeze... and smelling like Matilda.
She wrote to me...
AND?
single one could either convince my mind or touch my soul.
I have only one sister, the captain.
Can I speak frankly with you?
I thought you were already doing this.
I won't marry your sister.
I'm saving it for the battlefield.
That's a thousand ecus.
No.
How is this “no”?
No…
Hm.
I give you my word that none of my comrades...
Defend yourself, sir, or else...
Wait, wait, wait! Come on! You are noble people!
But d'Herblay is still a noble family. Lands, title...
Look! Blonde hair, clear skin...
Sorry what? Sorry?
Don't get involved in the conversation.
- I'll treat you to lead. - No need, he's mine.
- No, it's mine now. - I said it first!
All over me!
Stretcher here!
Lean back a little... Like this.
You can fit two or three more here.
Thank you.
Please find a doctor... He's somewhere here, nearby.
And what happened?
Call the chief doctor.
Matilda... I swear I had nothing to do with this.
No no!
- I'll kill you! - Wait! Calmly!
- Let me in! - He died like a hero, in battle!
He saved your brother's life.
What?
Right, Aramis?
- A? Yes. - And about the letter.
Beautiful! Before, how to go to the Lord, he said: “Let
Matilda console that suffering and joy are all... this...
Man of honor!
Tomorrow you will cook yourself.
It seems you are going in the wrong direction, sir.
I know exactly where I'm going.
And who sent you?
Captain de Treville.
Of course... From Equatorial.
I thought I made myself clear...
Athos didn't give you my instructions?
No, no... Athos conveyed everything very clearly.
They were forbidden to approach Count Chalet.
Captain, but he is a traitor! He tried...
I know.
What?
With all his influence... he would not attack the king alone.
The Comte de Chalet will answer for his actions, but before you, d'Artagnan.
Warriors of France, the British are already close.
Our ships from the nearest ports are ready to repel them...
But we must prevent them from going ashore!
I need two teams of volunteers...
Ready to go to almost certain death.
Very few will return.
Monsignor...
One officer to whom experience had
desire to volunteer first when the moment came.
Comte de Chalet, sir.
Count, you will lead the first detachment...
Take a step forward.
It is an honor.
Who will lead the second...
Captain de Treville?
…We'll see.
Thanks boy. Hmm...
Take the Bible.
Musketeers... Death is your calling...
One for all…
And all for one!
Go-go!
Go-go.
Let's go.
Lay down your weapons!
You're surrounded, captain.
You promised your people death...
Gentlemen, welcome.
Sir…
I have used your services many times in the past...
And today I offer you mine.
Count, I see evidence of your goodwill...
But since you are here, it means that the owner no longer needs you.
except your life?
Fire!
Fire!
The captain is wounded!
Let's retreat! Let's retreat!
Fire!
Back! Back!
Hold on...
Hurry up here!
Sister Marie, towels!
Help... For God's sake!
Go... We'll do our best.
I promise.
A woman's life is at stake.
Thank you.
For victory!
- Yes! - For Captain de Treville!
Porthos, I see, has already left.
Go ahead and say that he has nothing to drink.
There's nothing to drink here!
Isaac du Vallon de Brassier de Pierrefonds...
For friends, just Porthos.
Let's check!
D'Artagnan?
Me now.
<i>God…</i>
<i>I am unworthy and do not ask for anything for myself.</i>
But I beg you, have mercy on her.
If I'm not right for her,
Just give me a sign that she's alive.
The doctors!
He woke up!
Hurry up... He woke up.
You were a brave warrior...
I'm proud to have fought alongside you.
Musketeer…
I know you risked your life saving the Comte de Chalet.
But Lord
I swear that I will plunge this dagger into the heart of the first person who suggests surrender.
Gaston will not keep his word...
He will never give us independence!
I'll sail to London...
What if he doesn't come?
I will be very... persuasive.
- Madam... - Sir...
Look who's arrived.
Gee.
What does he want here?
Maybe the same as for us?
I'm sure he loves being spanked!
I'll rest here until spring... Then tell me!
Only you can carry out this delicate task.
Have I not done enough for you?
Do you think it's doable?
I rely on your audacity and ingenuity.
How are you? Athos...
This time in London
I'm more worried about my fate.
You will accomplish a feat in the name of France, Moreover, for a considerable fee.
D'Artagnan!
D'Artagnan!
Your Eminence... Don't you think
At our first meeting, in prison, you told me
What gift from France would meet your desires?
A paper with your signature, confirming that all... my actions
D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan, hurry up! Quicker! Behind me!
Here is your indulgence.
Wait...
Your Eminence, you told me about your enemy.
Not a word more...
Musketeers are soldiers...
Who is there?
Your husband.
What am I guilty of, besides that she loved you?
I thought, you love me as much as I love you...
I loved you.
I loved you.
Don't look with those eyes!
I have no other.
Does he remember me?
Don't come near me.
Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me?
Don't move!
Shoot, d'Artagnan!
Aramis!
That night Chalet's people were chasing her.
Shoot, d'Artagnan!
May the Lord hear you.
Let me go!
D'Artagnan!
It was the cardinal who kidnapped her... I saved her life!
I have an urgent message for the cardinal.
Where is she? One more step - and a bullet to the head!
My mind and your courage...
Where is Constance Bonacieux?
Why ask questions if you don't need answers?
You kidnapped her, I know!
Yes it's true…
But that's not what you asked me.
What's the rush? It was very difficult to escape from the king.
You do not love me…
But the reasons for your dislike are wrong...
Sometimes even from you.
How dare you!
I know who wanted to kill the king...
And I know it's not you.
Who?
Constance…
Your Majesty...
No, that's a lie.
Queen in Luzon...
Six hours of travel for a fresh horse and a skilled rider...
Just ask her.
If this is true, then I...
This is true.
You will pay me for this.
Do not shoot!
They tried to sail to England.
And this was found on them.
Both - on crosses...
Quiet, quiet... Don't worry.
Otherwise I'll go crazy.
Stand up, musketeer.
You must decide that the war has taken away my mind...
But the cardinal... claims what... did he give Constance to you?
Yes it's true.
- Is Constance alive? - Yes.
Thank you.
You are going to certain death.
I hope you forgive me.
Get ready!
Constance in London! Necessary…
What happened?
Benjamin!
Shoot them.
If I were you, I wouldn't rush.
Idris Annibah, Prince of Assinia...
For friends, just Hannibal. But for you - a prince.
You are clearly taking advantage of my position!
Don't move.
- What? - Here! Closer…
- Drum roll! - No.
- I'm right? - No.
- Do you like me. - No.
Captain de Treville!
Is everything okay, ma'am?
And I'll take you to the estate...

Excuse me.

You slept.
So you're not offended?
The Duke has given me permission... to bring you the Bible.

But I'm not trying to lure you away.
I ask you for one favor...
Bring me a knife.

But I'll give you a chance to escape.
This is nothing compared to your destiny.
The Duke ordered not to listen to your words.
- No! What are you doing?! No! No! - Meet death with dignity, madam.

Let's go.
Iris!
- What-- No, not her. - [Katie] Iris, run!
- Get back! - Stop.
Stay back.
She obeys you.
Sit in the chair.
Wait, that's my wife's.
[Neil] Sarah?
Please. Please, I don't-- I need to talk to Sarah, okay?
You're not Charles. You look like...
I'm not-- I don't--
I would never do that.
You know what?
the whole time thinking it was my fault.
I...
But now you've grown.
[Katie] Iris!
- Iris! - Stop!
Get back there.
That's what must've confused her.
That thing wasn't confused. It knew what it was doing.
[Neil] Wait, wait, there was a timer.
- I just-- I forgot. - You forgot?
If you change your mind...
Look, um, money's really no object.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
It was raining.
There's so much I wish I'd done better.
Who was it you were seeing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know there was someone else.
[Iris] Ten seconds.
[Iris] Neil, five seconds.
I just need to know what happened.
That's enough.
[Iris] Sarah?
We are both prisoners.
Wouldn't you want to know?
That-- that wasn't her.

You look old.
I'm sick, Cat.
Try and explain. [coughs]
I wanted to say goodbye.
Remember what happened the last time you tried to leave?
You came back to me, and your curse came with you.
You abandoned our daughter!
You. You're the monster, not me! [roaring]
[Owen] No, no!

You know who I wanna see.
[Owen] You can't be here.
- How did you find me? - I own your pub.

This wouldn't be happening if you'd stayed away--
horrible things followed me.
Freak accidents, sickness...
I came back here to protect you.

You can't control her.
All you can do is not use her.
[Owen] You're right.
[distorted] Foolish girl.

I've had plenty of suffering.
I failed you.
Forgive me, Iris.
But don't bring me back.

Just us.
See? It's my name on the deed now.
I remember what happened that night.
No. My head was spinning.
It was just something to calm you down.
Neil, we can still be together.
We can't be a family if she's alive.

She already does.
Let me go!
Sorry, but I can't lose her.

Death follows me.

I am still her master.

An angel from heaven.
Where were you all this time?
You're not afraid of anything.
I'm already making you laugh.
You don't believe me? - No.
What can I do to convince you?
I have nothing against your mother, But here...
my life is on the line.
So? - Agreement.
Du Barry, despite all due respect that I have for you...
It's mutual.
I'm listening.
As you know...
we send women to the king. - Yes.
Not one has ever caught his attention.
Indeed. - But now...

Just as if it were accidental.
So you're betting on chance. - Exactly, by chance.
Du Barry? - Yes.
marshal de Richelieu...
Come, I need you.
There are also first-class courtesans, mademoiselle Legrand and...
Countess de La Rena.
That was not the deal.
Richelieu wants to introduce you to the king.

I'll stay for your son.
Jeanne, my dear.
I love you.
Maybe not as you would like, But still.

That's your favorite cake, right?
What's up?
There's something in my mouth.
Yes, you're right.
Resting is important.
You'd keep me posted anyway of your liaisons?
I'm talking to you.
I'll see the rest in the afternoon.
Isn't it time to change your life? - Where should I go?
And with whom?
I can't abandon his son. Adolphe.
Jean wants me to introduce you to the king.
Yes, he talks about it day and night.
A life full of curiosity...
People like me never have time for anything.
So either I lead a life like them...
or a life full of liaisons.
I'd rather have the latter.
Turn around.
The king.
For my brother sentenced to death.
Sire.
Sorry, 'lord.'
Madame?
Monsieur.
His Majesty wishes to see Madame.
Very good. When?
Right away. If it suits madame.
I'm done.
No, you can't go like that. Change clothes, at least do your hair.
Be as graceful as ever.
You can do it.
What is that?
Jeanne.
More than one?
Mostly.
What does he mean? - If you have an itch.
No.
Every day I lubricate my...
love cavity in with precious oils.
No burning sensation at the micturition?
When urinating.
No.
Please. - Of course.
A little further.
Madame is worthy of the royal bed. - Good.
Sir...
I would give her a few days Quarantining...
should a venereal disease appear. - Thanks, but we'll leave it at that.
I now have to teach you some customs.
Good.
With that haughty attitude. - This is Versailles, madame.
I can't speak to the king like that.
I don't think the king you want to hear speak.
Arms higher.
Perfect.
But...
You don't need a thousand tricks to excite his senses.
But...
Should I say something special?
Your impetuousness will speak for you.
The only thing you need to remember...
do you need to do the following...
Is this a joke?
Absolutely not.
Except the Dauphin.
Understood? - Yes.
But...
What if I don't take those steps?
His Majesty will find you clumsy.
And? - He is very sensitive to charm.
Me too.
What's so funny, madame?
I laugh because you seem to be speaking on a six-franc piece.
Champagne?
May I?
Yes.
My God.
Delicious?
No.
Is this solid gold? - Yes.
Is your name on every fork and spoon engraved?
I think so.
So you are particularly interested in gold?
Look behind you. There.
The statue.
Yes. Is that also made of gold?
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
Sorry, but I can't.
Those little steps backwards. I'm sorry, I can't.
I don't believe in astrology, Majesty.
Your Majesty.
For what? - Not to take those steps.
That's you.
As a child?
Please, can you loosen your hair?
Yes, your majesty.
Madame?
Madame?

The same routine every day? - Yes.
The same people saying the same things? - Yes.
Eyes closed.
Open them.
Can I open it?
Do you?
Of course.
See you soon. - Yes.
Excuse me.
Who are these people with the king?
He exudes malice.
No idea.
You know that.
The dauphin.
He's so handsome.
And all those women there?
The king's daughters. Adélaïde, Sophie, Victoire...
I have rarely seen such ugly women.
Do we never see the Queen?
Because she suffers from her husband's infidelity.
Like all queens of France.
The king admires her discretion, her humility, her gentleness.
He cheats on her in the palace and in the Parc-aux-Cerfs.
She shouldn't have any luxury...
Or people who...
Your hood, fast. Sit back.
We can go better. Coachman.

Indeed.
Well guessed.
Because mass is at 10 a.m. - Precise.

with someone from his family or alone.
And he spends the afternoon with hunting...
Dinner? - Dinner is at 18:00.
they should only take small portions After the taster has tasted...
of the king's 40 dishes. - Yes.
Dukes and Duchesses sit, Graves and countesses stand.
You will be judged strictly at the introduction.
I am the king. Look at me.
Good.
Lower your eyes. - Or else?
Or else the court will seeing that as arrogance.
Proud.
Or as an invitation.
An invitation? - Yes.
Until?
Ordinary...
an invitation.
For what? - An invitation to...
You get the idea.
No. - Yes.
You make me laugh.
Let's move on.
Step back to the door.
You walked on it.
The whole court is watching you.
She'll come in a minute.
Countess Jeanne du Barry.
Finally.
What brutality.
What does she think? - Shame.
to Countess du Barry.
A gift?
<i>My days and nights know little rest and a lot of worries</i>
<i>I'm in love, but heaven sees No happier lover</i>
My God.
Thank you.
What is your name? - Zamor.
Welcome. - Thank you.
Welcome, Zamor. - Thank you.
Make a bow to the king. A reverence.
Look at that.
The shame.
This is your home.
I will introduce you: hair, make-up, lackeys...
intendant, chambermaids.
Go ahead.
<i>Supported by the king...</i>
<i>Jeanne Versailles explained her love for simplicity and the arts op.</i>
<i>And that, somewhere in Austria...</i>
<i>Luckily for her, Jeanne was now first lady at court.</i>
<i>But for how long?</i>
<i>And dismiss Jeanne at the slightest misstep.</i>
Wonderful.
What a divine mystery.
Is something wrong, madame?
Only the stars interest you, Majesty.
That's true.
I love you, madame.
It turns you on that you don't know me. - But I know you.
She is dressed like a man.
I'm not the Queen. - Not yet.
<i>On her first official outing...</i>
<i>Jeanne appeared triumphantly arm in arm with the king.</i>
<i>Broke a woman with the habit of hoop skirt and powdered wigs...</i>
Don't be so proud. Pride can destroy you...
But Jeanne, the Parc-aux-Cerfs.
I know. He's not going there anymore.
The Pompadour had it built to satisfy his lusts.
With you, he doesn't need that anymore?
Precise. Not like some others.
If you are so irresistible, Then why doesn't he marry you?
Then we must have our marriage annul.
His great-grandfather married his mistress.
I'm most worried about Zamor. He only has me.
You need a home and assets. Don't worry about that black one.
Thank you.

Do blacks live there?
This black one comes from Africa, but via India.

Although you should not be of nobility to stay at court.

You are right. A little pink tongue.
My sisters.
It's over. Ready.
They're mean.
<i>Relinquished her title and her privileges and became non.</i>
Sire, Countess du Barry. - Good.
Is it Louise's fate that worries you so much?
I have to work.
I salute you. - Sorry?
You greet me?
Yes. I salute you.
Who was in his bed last night? - Madame de Brèche.
Does the king have other mistresses?
If I fall out of favor...
warn me immediately, Then I leave.
You must remain dignified and brave.
And I am condemned to faithfulness?
<i>She was still his favourite.</i>
<i>Despite the derision about her striped dresses and men's clothing...</i>
<i>The ladies of the court imitated her as eagerly as they blacked her out.</i>
Behold. That...
<i>Jeanne had four happy years With the king...</i>
<i>Zamor grew up and thanks to Jeanne a sensitive, learned young man.</i>
<i>But it was for Adolphe, Now introduced to the court...</i>
Enough, Adolphe. Stopper.
Better, but...
<i>But another wedding took care of it for upheaval.</i>
<i>The dauphin, heir to the throne...</i>
<i>Finally got married the young Marie-Antoinette of Austria.</i>
<i>Jeanne's position was in jeopardy.</i>
You need to see her skin. - My God, white as milk...
Louis?
No.
But, I can teach you.
Maybe later?
Mercy?
Madame, the Dauphine is hungry.
When will it be served?
Of course.
Thanks, Mercy.
And Countess du Barry.
She's in white. In white.
Victoire.
She has her hair loose.
Terrible.
How dare they?
Where that girl is.
Who is that beauty? - That's a street girl.
We have to get rid of that person.
We are counting on you to disown her.
I think I'm going off the table. - Behold.
I can't see it.
Outrageous that the king wants that man Proposals to the Dauphine.
That is unworthy of a Christian king.
Obviously, tonight we're celebrating the end of that man.
Du Barry cherishes for no one affection or hatred.
With such a character, one cannot rule. - Behold.
This woman has something the Pompadour missed.
The thing between our legs, Dear lady.
for that horrible woman to drive away from the court.
The more you ignore that human, the more the kingdom will love you.
Maybe he'll listen to you.
That person should not speak to you As long as you haven't addressed her yet.
You know that, right?
In that case...
Thank you.
Amen.
Adolphe is defeated in a duel.
It's serious. A carriage is ready.
<i>Jeanne came the death of Adolphe not over...</i>
<i>That beloved son she hadn't given birth to.</i>
<i>The Future Queen still ignored her.</i>
Stop.
Don't be chased away by their bullying.
Well, your majesty.
I will do everything in my power To bring the Dauphine to reason.
Good.
The Dauphine will address you tomorrow.
At 4 p.m. In the games room.
It goes like this.
A look, a word, a sign.
The Dauphine prefers to...
I wish Adolphe was here.
Name a map, whatever.
Queen of Spades. - Queen of Spades.
Mostly...
a map comes up.
Ladies and gentlemen, it can't be anything but...
A heart like mine.
Thanks, all.
It's time for our singing lessons.
The king.
Your Majesty, I...
Poor Mercy. He tried so hard.
I think Mercy is right and not you, Adélaïde.
What an idiot.
Majesty...
Charming.
A shepherdess.
Will Your Majesty honor us with his presence?
No.
May I ask why?
No sense.
Well, your majesty...
my respect.
What are a lot of people today in Versailles?
But... why?
She talked to you.
What animates her? Why?
She runs.
She spoke to me.
She said something to me.
She spoke to me.
She spoke to me.
<i>Nine words from the beautiful mouth of a princess save Jeanne from disgrace.</i>
I think we should tell him. - Good luck, Duke.
A third bloodletting is necessary.
Jeanne...
They want a third bloodletting.
Yes? Yes, Sire.
Where is Jeanne? - She's here.
Jeanne?
Yes? - I'm thirsty.
Thank you, Zamor.
He has smallpox.
That would kill him.
You're in danger, madame.
Should he die, the royal family will chase you away.
No.
A simple relapse, that's all. - At 64 years old, smallpox is severe.
We shouldn't tell him. - Agree, it would weaken him.
Let us in.
Madame, smallpox is contagious.
This is grotesque. - No.
Bring me a mirror.
Bring me a mirror.
Show me...
how I'm doing.
Sire...
to prove that you repent, you must renounce the scandal.
I'm afraid of hell, Jeanne.
You have to withdraw.
You have to withdraw.
Light the candle.
Félicité, you can watch Is the candle still burning?
Yes, it's still burning.
Thank you.
Jeanne, Jeanne.
She's coming back.
I want to say goodbye. - No.
Let her in.
Yes, Sire.
I will accompany you.
I love you.
Finally...
there you are.
I love you too, Jeanne.
Soulful.
Jeanne...
My dear.
Thank you, Sire.
You have always been good to me.
See you later. - See you later.
I absolve you of all your sins.
The king has God Asked for forgiveness...
Supporting the faith and give relief to his people.
Yes, Sire.
Long live the king. - Long live the king.
I am committed to you.

So Fatima...
We were not expecting you alive.
It is indeed a miracle that you're alive.
Thank our doctors.
They really fought for your life.
So,
Yes,
I didn't think I would get out alive myself.
Thanks to all of you, for saving my life.
Sir...
Sir, please, get my child back.
The search is on.
Crying or getting emotional will not help you at all.
It will only make things worse for you.
We have every reason to believe that you are a dreaded terrorist, Fatima Ba.
So if you want to prove otherwise, this is your chance.
Everyone here has the same teary stories.
So, take this conversation very seriously
and get to it, straight.
Let's talk?
Yes, sir.
I am Shalini Unnikrishnan.
I am from Kerala, India.
And sir, I was trapped.
I was brainwashed... sir.
Name?
-Ishak. -Fatima.
The flight has landed.
They are coming out. Goodbye.
Almost a year ago, we left Thiruvananthapuram
To serve Khalifa.
To fight the infidels.
Ishak was to become a mujahideen
She neither found the ground nor the sky
Is enough to lead her astray.
The vision is slowly getting blurry
Nothing was spoken, nothing was said
Who leaves like this?
She did not find the ground, nor the sky
Is enough to lead her astray.
Ishak.
If they ask you anything,
She mistook the prison for a flight
She left the branch of every tree
The memories of that greenery linger
The roads kept up the conversation
The crazy bird was imprisoned
She did not find the ground, nor the sky
Is enough to lead her astray.
You yourself decided to go to Syria.
This is what is emerging.
And for that, you prepared for years.
and against mankind.
I...
I did leave India of my own will.
And yes, I did a lot of preparation before leaving.
it was all fed into my brain, like programming.
I had lost control over myself.
I am not alone in this game.
Who have fled their homes only to be buried in this desert.
Fareed, come on.
Allah wills it.
Welcome. Please enter.
Let's go.
We have only one objective.
Which is,
We love Indian music.
But I have stopped now.
Don't you consider things like music and song haram?
We’re Pashtuns - a tribe from the mountain.
We are living here, in the Hindukush, for thousands of years.
Even before Islam.
We never trusted Pakistan anyway.
We still don't.
But what if the American army stops us at the border?
Talk to them in English only.
Give them the human rights spiel.
They know that the Talib people are savages.
And one more thing.
The Americans aren't the only obstacle.
You need to be careful about the Haqqani and Talibani mujahideens.
It is America that gave birth to these breeds.
This is why ISIS

Heaven on earth.

Love will you give me a garland
The wedding garland the one made of basil leaves
Full moon night the love which came as a garland
Love will you give me a garland
Child…
Yes?
Shalu is leaving tomorrow.
And before she leaves
That's what I've been preparing.
Okay.
I don’t understand anything!
That too Kasargod? Why?
Aren’t there colleges in Trivandrum?
No known people. She has to stay alone.
She has just completed graduation, Amma.
She will pursue post-graduate studies in Nursing over there.
She could get a job in Mumbai, Delhi, or Dubai.
National Nursing College isn't just any college, Amma.
She will meet many girls from here at her hostel.
Amma?
Amma, I’m, back.
I will come to your mind like the moon.
I will be having no gold
To dance with you
Full moon night the love which came as a garland
Love will you give me a garland
Too much traffic...
Amma, I'll just call you.
Shalini!
Correct, but how did you know?
Simple. There are three girls here already.
And who could that be?
(together) Shalini!
I'm so stupid...
Hey, water?
Thank you.
I'm Shalini Unnikrishnan from Thiruvanathapuram.
I'm Nima Matthews.
Hi.
-I'm from Kottayam. -Oh.
We have an old saying about you guys.
I know.
If you see a cobra or a southerner, kill the southerner first.
Exactly!
By the way, I am from Kochi.
Being in the middle has to have some benefit, right?
You're safe!
I'm Gitanjali Menon.
-Hi. -Nice to meet you.
Let me guess. Malappuram or Kozhikode?
Mmmm, not bad! Malappuram.
-And my name is Asifa Ba. Welcome. -Hi.
Thank you.
who left their boring lives at home to come here?
And who will definitely miss their home after coming here?
My life is not that boring.
But...
I'm here for the excitement of hostel and college life.
Don't worry.
My home is very close. We can visit any time.
So I'm not just your roommate, but your local guardian too!
That's a promise.
Guys, we cannot be late.
Let's go fast.

So, the Student Union president,
I want the walls of my college clean.

…and the country
Shalini does not exist.
Nowhere.
And right now the Indian government just denounced you also.
Sir,
This is a very dangerous game, sir.
This game is about killing my soul,
A...
A robotic slave: Fatima.
And see, sir, they’re successful also,
Tell me.
When exactly did you join ISIS?
Rather than knowing when I joined ISIS,
It’s more important to know why and how I joined ISIS, sir.
I don't know why nobody wants to listen to these things.
Why doesn't anybody do anything?
I don't know.
Kerala is sitting on a live time bomb, sir.
Please save it.
Please.
I'll just get out.
Ishak.
Ishak!
The bodies...
Sit, sit...
-Sit, sit... -That...who...
Drink some water.
How much longer?
We'll reach Shahbad in half an hour.
That will be your home for a few days.
As soon as Khalifa gives the order,
you will be taken to Syria from there.
But we will part way over there.
Ishak...
I am missing Amma a lot.
Amma would've taken such good care of me.
Please arrange a call with Amma, please.
Have you lost your mind? "Please."
Just one phone call.
Huh?
Your phone will be under surveillance.
When our phones were taken away in Sri Lanka
And the enemy traitors
Sorry. Sorry...
Know your right objective, Fatima.
And anyway,
according to ISIS, in the Sharia law, women aren’t allowed to keep phones.
What?
I don't know all that.
Ishak.
Stop it, Ishak. What are you doing?
-Today I won't listen. -I’m very tired.
I'm pregnant, Ishak.
Please leave me.
Our marriage is an agreement. Ishak, please…
Ishak, what are you doing?
-Ishak! -Not keeping your husband happy
Ishak...
Ishak, I will shout.
Nothing will happen to your baby.
Ishak this is rape!
Islam doesn't allow for rape
Rape? When a husband does this, it isn’t rape.
Ishak! It's hurting
Be grateful. A woman just needs to cook
and sleep with her husband.
You can make your choice. You either take this pain,
or burn in hell for all eternity.
Ishak!
[unintelligible]
Don't I look like Katrina Kaif?
Don't I?
In Kasargod market. Beauty queen!
Thank you.
Piping hot!
Yeah?
Yes.
Rubbish. Anything she is telling.
Asifa?
Umm, thanks.
-I don't use lipstick. -Why?
No makeup?
My hijab suits me best.
I love natural beauty.
Bollywood's first hijabi heroine:
Asifa Ba!
I think whether it is full makeup or a natural look,
whatever you wear, you should wear it with full confidence.
We're coming. In five minutes.
Listen, be nice and careful. okay?
Hmm. Bye.
Okay, so girls, we are
going out for our first dinner together, excited?
Yay!
We can do a city trip and
Hi, I'm Rameez.
I'm doing my MBBS, final year.
Hey, come on Rameez. Don't overdo it.
We're all comfortable, don't worry.
Uh, after MBBS, umm...
Yeah, I'm trying for MS.
I'd like to try for the US or UK.
Why the US or UK?
Why not India?
India?
Look...
and for us Muslims...
"Punarjanam"?
In Islam, it is taught that however much you earn,
you must donate a part of it to charity
and use it to help people.
I will be able to help more people.
Plus, I want to enjoy both, life and the afterlife, so
that is the plan.
Our treat.
Come on.
Love to, but we have some urgent work.
-Okay. -Okay?
All this looks so delicious, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Cheese!
[unintelligible]
Sorry, uh...
You guys don't pray before eating food?
I don't.
should thank the God of food and farmers.
My mother and grandmother chant some verses in Sanskrit.
But I don't know it specifically.
Now, I just see yummy food and then I eat it, so...
Hold on, we do say thank you.
We thank our mothers, and the lady who cooks for us,
But we say thank you after the meal.
Hey!
-Hi. -Sit.
Look, there's dancing over there!
-Let's go there? -Yeah.
[unintelligible]
Without faltering or flinching or lowering their eyes
-Asifa? -Yes?
If you don't mind, can I ask you something?
Sure, go ahead.
You were saying, eating without prayer is a sin.
Why?
And what were you praying anyway?
I was thanking Allah.
I was saying,
"Oh Allah, thank you so much for giving us this food and keeping us alive."
"Your generosity knows no bounds."
-And this food we eat? -Hmm?
So if we don't thank Allah,
Hellfire?
What is hellfire?
You don't know?
You know?
Hell-fire. So,
all the wrong deeds we do in this life,
we're punished for those after we die.
And for all the good deeds we do,
we get paradise, as a reward.
Punishment even after death!
My father is an atheist.
God didn't make religion, man did.
So there's no need to be formal with God or fear him.
Leave it.
Asifa, you were talking about hellfire.
-Yes. -What is hellfire?
So I was saying,
that hellfire is seventy times hotter than fire on Earth.
Oh dear.
And in hell, there is a dark well,
where all the sinners are tied, chained,
hung upside down and burned.
So whoever believes in Allah,
they get paradise in return.
And those who do not believe in Islam,
This sounds so painful!
I know...
Today I understand what "go to hell" actually means!
Isn't the relationship with god one of love?
Or should be.
Like the ones we have with our parents.
God! Please don't be angry!
But, one minute. Anyway, we are Hindus.
That's what. Why would your Allah punish us Hindus?
[unintelligible]
Only Allah.
And you are a non-believer.
Everybody's life has that one day of reckoning.
And I'm sorry,
you are a non-believer.
You'll surely go to hell.
Only Allah can save you.
No one else.
Whatever Asifa used to say,
they were quite scary.
And I did not have answers to challenge those fears.
Nimah was from Kottayam.
So every weekend she would go home to visit.
Geetanjali used to like the hostel more than her home.
Since my home was far away, I couldn't visit often.
In Malappuram.
Last Eid, all four of us friends celebrated together.
Asifa's family was very nice.
Her mom made vegetarian food especially for me.
That was around the time we started getting close to Rameez, Abdul, and Mujeeb.
And after training,
and you a Sunnat.
Hmm?
Women are not allowed to come here alone.
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me!
Punishment is not a verdict,
it is a lesson.
A lesson!
Anyone who strays from this path,
A lesson
And straying from this path
What this girl did
And her husband
ignored her wrongdoing
He is an even bigger criminal.
And now this lesson
Allah is great!
My name is Shazia.
I'm your neighbour.
I'm sorry.
Since everyone's in a burqa,
I didn't recognize you, maybe.
I'm Fatima.
Fatima.
Ya Allah...
You don't know how dangerous that can be.
And for women like us, this is impossible.
Why did they cut that lady's hand off?
Because she was wearing lipstick.
They cut her hand off just because she was wearing lipstick?
Good grace. Hey Bhagwan.
There is no Bhagwan
There is only Allah.
I'm sorry.
But, you're telling me all this...
You were alone in the market too.
What if someone shot you?
He's a Khursani commander.
They all take their orders from him.
You walk carefully. Come.
was getting shattered day by day.
we all were trapped hopelessly in it.
Seeing them killing people brutally, I
For many days, I
And my fear was legitimate.
Because what is a crime and following punishment,
was never taught to us in the Hindu religion.
I want to show you something very special.
Look at this video.
This medicine
which, in our language
is called 'chemical courage,'
is called Captagon and Amphetamine in pharma terms,
is something that will keep your thirst for jihad alive.
It will never let you stray from your one true objective.
will help you go long periods without feeling hungry, thirsty, or sleepy.
It will kill your coward self-inside you
and give birth to a mujahideen in you.
Who will hoist the flag of complete Islamic domination.
Who will get the infidels to praise the one true Allah.
God is great!
God is great!
Understood? My jihadis…
This medicine
will make your work easier.
Get them closer to you.
Isolate them from their families.
and as soon as possible, hand them over for the next mission.
What about that third girl?
Nimah.
She's Catholic, sir.
She won't be easily manipulated.
Mujeeb will have to do something special.
Great.
So much time has passed,
Maulvi Saheb.
Ohh shit. Nimah has messaged,
-Bye Asifa. -Bye.
They left.
Hmm.
-Then I was telling her... -Nima.
Hate you both.
Sorry sorry Nima
It’s okay now.
Shit! Really?
Let’s see.
Hey!
-What! -How dare you do that!
He hit her just now, I saw.
This is nonsense.
You'll forget all you have wished.
-One minute, -Nimah...
we'll go to the police.
Oi! Hey! Everyone come here.
You'll complain to the police
Who are you threatening, madam?
Nimah!
Nimah!
Who are you threatening?
Who are you threatening?
No!
Help! Help!
Shalini!
Nimah!
Nimah!
-Get up! -Nimah!
I am sorry guys, but
Be grateful, Allah saved you.
Are you justifying them?
No.
But think about it yourself.
You were the only three not wearing a hijab, right?
I'm sorry but he's not like your Gods.
Are you trying to say only Allah protects?
-Other Gods don't protect? -Exactly!
Because
your God is so helpless, He's always asking for help from others.
Even your Jesus, Nimah.
See, I understand what you're going through.
But just think about it once.
God's son,
God's own son, being hanged on a cross,
alive,
and God can't even save his own son. How will he save you?
Enough!
Stop now!
I'm sorry, okay!
But think about it.
You overdid it.
Idiot. Hang up now. I'll talk to you later.
Show?
Even the thought of going out is scaring me.
Those dogs...
Getting scary dreams at night. Just can't sleep.
If we were with you, this would've never happened.
Now...
These people make all Muslims look bad.
These bloody ba...
Sorry for my language.
Shalini...
Geetanjali...
I'm sorry again.
I promise this will never happen again.
We'll teach them a lesson they'll remember all their lives.
That's why I brought them here.
Do fix the rogues.
It's nothing, just anxiety.
Don't overthink now.
Sure...
Actually...
Umm, so listen.
But if you need anything, I'm just a call away. Okay?
Bye.
Take one pill each.
Whenever you feel anxiety, just have this.
Water.
Thanks.
It makes me feel very safe.
-Right, Gitu? -Yeah.
And what if the man's gaze isn't threatening?
Then...
I don't know.
Then...
In an Islamic marriage, what does the Qazi ask?
Everything is about accepting each other.
If both are accepting, then
how can love be a crime?
But what about physical intimacy?
I mean, according to Islam it's considered illegitimate before the wedding, right?
It is not acceptable.
In fact, not just in Islam,
no religion condones pre-marital sex if it is a one-night stand.
But, if two people
decide to commit to a relationship for their whole lives,
that’s where I spend all my nights and days,
In school, festivals were like holidays.
So it was fun.
Now what, it's just about eating yummy food.
Here also we can eat.
religious stuff I don't know much about.
All these rituals, customs,
You don't want to celebrate it with your family?
We can do all that in our old age.
I don't think so.
I've been praying since childhood.
I agree with Nimah.
Even I have been praying since childhood.
Allah listens.
But you need to have faith.
Why not?
Just not in the way you Hindus claim.
Here you go again.
You will start again. I have to go to the church and pray.
Happy Diwali to you both. Bye!
-Bye! -Wait for some time!
Bye.
Bye.
My mother sent this. Said forget your diet now.
So...
Our religion has thousands of Gods and Goddesses.
I think Shiva is a big God.
See, I'm sorry, but
you've heard that story about your big God, right?
The one in which he carries his dead wife on his shoulders
and roams around the country.
how can he be a God?
Seriously?
You're trying to say that the God Shiva
Yes.
But in north India, Ram and Krishna are the big Gods.
They're known to be great.
I'm sure you know the story of Lord Ram. Everyone knows it.
That his wife was abducted by Ravana.
To save his wife,
And you guys worship the monkeys too?
I'm sorry.
And...one of your Gods
Fuck, yeah this is so complicated and confusing.
It is confusing because you're following the wrong path.
It's very beautiful and sacred.
I'll show you the right path.
Captagon? Amphetamines?
Are you serious?
The government doesn't believe it, but this is happening.
And these drugs are used ceaselessly.
Not with the side effects.
They want their suicide bombers.
-Shazia! -Fatima?
Shazia... I'm in terrible pain.
I can't come with you.
I'll... I'll do one thing.
I'll send Razia with you. She'll take you to the hospital.
I need to call my mother once, please.
Mother...
-Razia. -I am here with you.
Everything's gonna be... yes, yes...
Nurse, don't [unintelligible]
I will count.
You just push, you just push
I promise you. Fatima, you push, 1, 2, 3, you push.
Yes, yes, good!
Yes, yes [unintelligible]
After that, you can take the phone.
But please, just one call, nurse, please!
Can I make a call?
Nurse... ma'am!
It isn't an ordinary gun.
Kabul.
There's a mission for the Indian and American embassies.
I'm not going as a suicide bomber.
Don't be tense.
Can I come with you?
Because of her, we can't even have sex properly.
With her?
I feel suffocated here, Ishak.
I'll leave, I'm telling you.
Without me,
One day I will.
Leave, then.
Leave!
One look at a solitary woman
and these people will sell you off.
Or shoot you.
Leave!
Shazia...
There's no money at home, no food, no clothes.
She's just crying like this continuously.
Oh...
I'll give you some medicine.
Here.
Give her to me.
Here.
What's wrong? What happened?
Shazia...
Can you arrange for me to talk to my mother?
Just one call.
I haven't contacted anyone myself for two years now.
Shazia, please.
I just want to talk to my mother once.
Mother will make everything all right.
I don't know how to manage it.
Please. Just once.
Husna...
these calls are tracked by the US security agency.
And then they'll know our location.
-One minute. -Husna, please.
For my daughter.
Please.
-No, no. -Husna.
Just open the door. Okay?
Please.
Husna.
But, but...
You can send a message via the Call Gram app.
Okay, no problem.
But you won't get a reply.
Amma.
You're a grandmother now.
Ishak has left me.
I'm completely alone, Amma. I won't be able to live much longer.
Tell them to pressure Asifa and the Maulvi.
They know about this place.
Tell the police my address.
Get me out of here, Amma, please.
Come on.
May Allah always protect you.
-Come on. -Not through this gate, take the back gate.
It's not my phone!
You guys are going home,
but will you be able to tell your families about Abdul and Rameez?
It will create unnecessary complications.
And anyway,
You will see, how you will be ill-treated.
I doubt you'll be able to fight back such behaviour.
Ajit!
Child...
What is this?
Will you stop believing in God tomorrow?
Child!
All this worshiping of stones
is not going to help you.
How could he?
A God who is so helpless could never save the lives of others.
After realizing all this,
Hey...
Come please, come.
Got yourself a coconut I see.
You didn't even call me.
I was too stressed.
Same, bro.
My "communist" father,
And his so-called wife, my mother,
Shalu, I'm telling you,
Communists are the biggest hypocrites.
Hmm... Live-in relationship!
Our bodies have accepted each other.
Hmm! Good.
Oh! You're over-acting as if I don't what's been going on between Abdul and you.
Before Rameez and I said 'I accept' to each other, you both did the same!
Along with romance you are spying on us too?
Silly girl.
But truthfully, Gitu,
I'm experiencing all of this for the first time in my life.
-When he looks at me only, I feel... -Okay, okay, okay.
Too much excitement but there is a small problem.
-Hey! -See what she's telling!
See what Gitu is telling, Abdul!
Islam isn't a complex religion like others.
It is simple and straightforward.
and the one who runs it is the same.
Close both your eyes and feel the presence of Allah.
For this, you do not need to visit any church or temple.
You don't need to offer flowers, oils, and leaves
"If you need money, go to this temple."
"If you want knowledge, go to that temple."
"If it's strength you want, go to that temple."
You don't need to go from one place to the other.
Simply ask Allah for His blessing.
He will grant you every wish.
This peaceful religion
Come, and change your life.
-Nice lecture, right? -Hmm.
Thank you, Gitu.
I'm Shalini,
We live right here, in the Centre dormitory.
Are you Hindu too?
I'm Bhagyalakshmi.
Out of us 48 girls,
there are seven Christians,
the rest are Hindus.
We all left our houses and came here.
What happened to you?
We all 48 girls have the same story.
they get us married off to random men.
before falling in love with them?
So...
What will you do now?
Our love is true.
You would cross all limits, right?
Oh dear, Shalini!
One minute, don't worry...
Geetu, I’m not feeling well.
No way. I don't believe it. Okay! I am not that irresponsible.
Get a DNA test done, you'll get your confirmation.
Okay, look.
I'm sorry for behaving rudely. Okay? Just sit.
In some time, everyone in the hostel will know.
It will reach my family.
-You're not understanding. -Enough, listen to me.
Listen to me.
The problem you are mentioning has a solution.
Just marry Rameez!
But how? She's a Hindu girl.
-So? -So?
-What? -Yes...
After the wedding, this child be your legitimate child.
Then is there any problem?
My family has no problems if I marry a Muslim girl...
That doesn't make any sense.
-suddenly converting to a Muslim, how… -Why?
For us, for our child, for our marriage, can't you do this?
See, Gitu, Asifa.
Please understand what she's going through.
She will only do what is right for you, the child, and herself.
Yes.
Rameez.
everything will be okay.
Shalini...
Please have faith in me.
Hmm?
Okay, then
I'll talk to the seniors about your wedding.
But before that, I'll have to talk about the conversion, so...
You accept, right?
You accept, right?
Who poured poison into the virgin minds...
Which destroyed the very soul.
Showing the wrong image of the religion...
The hooligans changed the existence of humans.
flows a beautiful river.
Behind that, lies a house.
On the rooftop, you and I
dear Allah will give it to us.
will be our paradise.
As she opened her eyes she could see all
We suffered heavy losses during the US drone strike last night.
Ishak was martyred.
Come in.
Shazia. Ishak is dead.
What?
Coming here was a huge mistake.
Fatima, calm down.
Let me do something.
But look,
don’t try to run away again.
If you try to run,
Okay?
He suffered a cardiac arrest.
Mother called.
So go and meet them?
My parents make no difference to me.
They don't believe in Allah.
Whoever doesn't believe in Allah is an infidel.
May Allah reward you for your good deed.
Look. You're absolutely in the right, Anisha.
But till you don't deal with your past life,
Look...
She did not get the ground nor the sky
Is enough to lead her astray.
that you converted to Islam...
He could not bear the shock.
This heart attack is Allah's wrath.
It's a lesson.
…for any person who doesn't believe in Him.
If you care for your well-being,
then convert to Islam.
She did not get the ground nor the sky
Rameez has completed his job.
Give me a couple of days, sir. It will be done.
ISIS has given us the opportunity to finish what Alamgir Aurangzeb
Of course, I do, Abdul.
Why are you going on and on about Syria?
There is nothing bigger than serving God.
And you don't want
We can help hoist the flag by staying here too.
Like Asifa does.
That's what she does. isn't it?
Are you going to marry me or not?
If you force me to,
I won't.
why would I listen to you?
Look.
I will destroy you.
When all these things were happening with Shalini,
First, you preached good things about Islam.
Then you pretended to fall in love with us.
So that you could have sex with us.
You wanted to get me pregnant, right?
You dared to question my manhood, you mother...
You called me impotent.
Check this.
This...
When...
When did you take this picture?
You only sent these nudes to me while drunk.
Impotent?
Now you listen.
You will marry me and come to Syria.
And if you say no,
I will make your video go viral on social media.
he would turn out to be such a selfish coward.
He's an infidel.
But, now what will happen to me?
And what about this child? I'm pregnant now...
Have faith in Allah, child.
He will make everything all right.
If a kind man blessed by Allah
is willing to marry you,
It cannot happen...
Try to understand your situation, child.
Some decisions must be taken by the brain, not by heart.
You cannot go back to your home.
They wouldn't even accept you.
And...
You can't get rid of this baby either.
and you still haven’t finished your Nursing degree.
I'd rather die by killing myself.
You're actually thinking of suicide after converting to Islam?
Your first crime:
Second crime:
Third crime:
Your parents are infidels.
How many crimes will Allah punish you for?
So would marrying someone else mean my sins are forgiven?
Not by continuing living in this country.
But yes,
if you get married
then Allah would forgive not one,
but a thousand sins.
Sorry, Dad.
I’m a bad girl.
But it isn't my fault alone.
It's yours too!
You keep teaching me foreign ideology, like communism, but
…you never told me about our religion… our traditions.
I won't go back, Dad. I won't.
You were right.
So were Mother and Nimah.
Big mistake.
Big mistake.
Do you accept Ishak as your legal husband in exchange
Do you accept?
I do.
Fast, please fast.
Do you accept?
I accept.
-Congratulations! -Congratulations!
-Get aside. -You can't go in.
Shalini!
Shalini!
-Madam, you can't go inside. -Shal...
Mr. Maulvi,
I'm very happy, that my daughter has married someone she likes, of her own will.
I will accept my son-in-law too.
And...
But...
I will do anything for my only daughter.
Aunty...
I just want to take them both home.
-Mr. Maulvi... -Fatima.
-Just listen-- -Shalini!
-Daughter! -Aunty, listen...
-Daughter! -Aunty, listen to me... Aunty...
-Daughter! -Let her go, Aunty.
-Daughter! Shalini! -Aunty, let it go.
-Listen to me. -Shalini, don't go!
Listen to me.
What you're asking for is impossible.
She's my daughter!
You're the one who isn't getting it, Aunty.
We're here with her. You can leave.
Please leave, Aunty.
Hello...
Child...
They didn't let Shalini come with me.
And Shalini didn't insist on coming either.
Why?
Aunty, because...
Shalini is pregnant.
and even on official Twitter handle.
It has been uploaded on various platforms in over a hundred groups, causing a stir.
According to sources, these were uploaded from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Malaysia.
Whoever refuses to go to Syria.
they wanted us to leave India anyhow. That's it.
Then I happily started preparing to go to Syria.
You don't know how dangerous that medicine is.
You've seen those videos right?
Where they easily slit the throats of infidels?
Sir, these medicines make any person
Without any fear.
So...
Becoming a killing machine
It was all done easily.
Because Salafi Centre, the travel agencies and the embassy were all colluding.
And Asifa took me for some lavish shopping.
in several cases of sedition and national security.
Even maps.
Like, toposheets, solar compass and different survival apparatus...
Before we left for Colombo,
I was allowed to meet my Amma.
-My child! -But my mother was only told that
we were going to Colombo for our honeymoon.
After I come back from Colombo, I'll come home.
Don't stress.
Keep it.
Call me, child.
Hurry up.
Hello?
Nimah? Hello...
I'm in Colombo for our honeymoon.
Did you marry Rameez?
Nimah, I'm pregnant.
Rameez deceived me and left.
He left India.
Asifa is behind all this.
You told me to meet Mujeeb, right?
So he...
Everyday...
18 to 20 people would come.
And then I used to lose count.
Everything would turn blurry.
I couldn’t even file an FIR.
You don't know...
Geetanjali committed suicide...
What? Gitu?
When? Why you didn't call me?
Shalini, fuck the honeymoon
Just come back, you're not safe Shalini. Please come back.
okay, I...
I'll talk to you... I'll call you... I'll call you in some time...
I'll talk to you later. I'll call you back.
My friend Nimah called.
Nimah was raped.
And Geetanjali committed suicide.
And Geetanjali left Islam to become a Hindu again.
Maybe they both paid for their sins.
When we were leaving Colombo,
it did occur to me once,
Why would Allah be so cruel?
Geetanjali and Nimah were believers.
Then why would such bad things happen to them?
that I bought it.
Sir, this is a global agenda.
Sir, these machineries are isolated in Europe and America.
Our ex-Chief Minister has said
that in the next twenty years Kerala will become an Islamic state.
On an average of 2800 to 3200 conversions
are happening.
More than 30,000 girls are missing, sir.
The unofficial number is 50,000.
We all believe that, sir.
703.
261.
You can't do this!
-Hey! -Move!
-Sazia! Listen to me! -Hey!
Sazia! Help me!
-Wait! -Let go of me!
It's a big nexus between a local organisation of Kerala and ISIS.
They're raising a ruthless, ruthless army of suicide bombers.
Is this harmless?
I respect them too.
We will start investigating your complaint from today itself.
But for everything you are telling me,
You're giving us news and numbers.
Not evidence. The credible evidence.
How can we interfere with the life decisions of two adults?
Come on.
Give this baby to me.
She is too young!
Wait!
Wait, she's too young, she won't survive, please!
Ishak!
Just to take my FIR down,
it took this long.
How long will justice take?
When?
Will you ask for evidence then too?
You know about Attikad in Kasargod, right?
You still want evidence?
Sri Lanka, Singapore, Afghanistan...
And you still want evidence?
Okay fine, sir.
Okay, fine.
You wait, sir. I will get it.
Came here for love.
Turned me into a slave.
Sex slave.
You're new here.
Slowly you'll understand.
These people don't kill us.
But they kill our souls every day.
We're their slaves,
Here, if husbands die in battle,
their wives either have to become full-time sex slaves,
Other than that, a woman here has no third choice.
Bhagyalakshmi?
I'm Shalini.
Hey, come on, move.
What... One minute...
Hey, come on.
I...
it seemed to me that we were crossing the Iranian desert
and going towards Irbil.
Which is close to the Syria-Turkey border.
And I knew that the Syria, Iran and Turkey border
So I knew
that this was my last chance to escape from there.
Delta to Base.
On journey right now and
we seem to have located the target.
Going in for a quick look.
and 59.2711°S. Over and out.
Sir,
I have told you the truth, all of it. I've told you everything.
If you take me to India, I will expose everybody.
Everyone here is involved in terrorism. Everyone.
Shalini...
But we have nothing that proves you not guilty.
You came here with proper training.
You crossed three countries with a fake passport.
When you left India, all your efforts were for going to Syria.
The Indian government has zero tolerance for any terror link.
You've co-operated with us so far in this investigation.
We'll make sure that we'll provide you a safe place at this facility
And we will try to find your daughter.
Hello?
Hello?
My child, Shalini?
Child...
Child...
Just come home.
This year we'll celebrate Onam together, daughter.
I'm fine, Mom.
Don't stress.
I'm trying to come back home.
I'll call you again.
I'm sorry...
Now don't worry, everything will be okay.
Everything will be fine.
I will make everything all right.
I promise.
Shaalu?
Shaalu, my child?
Shaalu?
What's your name?
Shalini Unnikrishnan, a Hindu from Kerala.
The battle continues day &amp; night.
Long live our war.
We shall make the war fun.
Long live our war...
Long live our war.
OK, I'm done.
Honey, we want the red, right?
What?
The wine.
Oh, yeah.
Man!
Alright, do we want Burgundy or Bordeaux?
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's impossible to say.
You OK, pumpkin?
Sarah?
Simon?
Simon?
Simon?
Honey?
Sarah?
I couldn't find the light.
- I wonder if she gave it to me. - What?
Something about her look. The way she looked at me.
Baby, come on. Don't go into this again.
You're such a dick sometimes.
Look, let's just be happy, alright?
We're... we're having a baby.
I'm having a baby.
Jesus. Yeah, play that card.
She gave me the evil eye.
Yeah. Ever since then, I've been feeling, like, this sickness,
just, like, awful anxiety,
and seeing things in my sleep.
It makes perfect sense. You're expecting a child.
Of course you're gonna feel out of sorts.
You're not listening.
You don't always have to explain everything.
You don't have to pretend you understand everything.
Alright, what's her address?
- What? - This old bitch from the restaurant.
Where does she live?
I'm gonna find her.
I'm serious.
I'll do whatever it takes to protect you.
That guy is into some creepy shit, babe. You have to admit, he's, like...
Yeah!
Mel, check this out. It just came.
Look at these real horns.
Goat horns.
Yes, Dustin, those are real horns.
Wow.
Hey, buddy.
Or girl.
Baby, I just saw a fucking coyote.
What?
You OK?
Sort of like a...
Yeah, let's go.
Speaking of grandpas and aches and pains,
But, thanks to me, he doesn't anymore.
It's true.
She has... thousands of candles and plants.
Uh... House Blessing, Kundalini Energy,
Like you need any more of that?
Well, yeah...
Hate Divider, Hate Separator,
I've used it!
And, no, she's great. She's great. She's got...
Hate Avoider, Love Fix.
You look like you're two peas in a pod.
Well, yeah...
Whatever. Like you believe in any of this stuff.
Simon is a skeptic. He doesn't believe in anything.
It's true. In college, we took a Catholicism class.
And he stands up on the first day mid-lecture and goes,
"Death is the end no more!"
- shattering it and walked out. - Oh, my God!
Alright, but, look...
how about a "Help Me Believe In This Bullshit" candle?
Oh, actually, that was my first candle.
Ah, yes it was, and I think you're referring to, Simon,
the Faith candle.
How about a "People Are Watching Me" candle?
Simon...
Wait, what?
and staring at her.
I've just been feeling sick and... anxious.
-And... - You're being threatened?
You're pregnant, baby!
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking. - You keep saying that.
Sarah, listen...
I'm a professional. I am.
I make my money by healing people and keeping them safe.
And I'm not surprised.
You know what?
Let's bust out the board.
Yes!
Let's take it on head-on, right?
It's not, like, a Ouija board, it's just a Ouija board.
So, how does this work?
It's called the ideomotor effect.
We're all gonna move it,
and we're gonna think somebody else did.
Idiot monitor what?
Ideomotor effect.
It's a subconscious movement based on prior expectations.
In other words... it's bullshit.
OK, let's all hold hands.
This is your spirit.
And do not mock,
or invite anything from the beyond.
Let's not forget our mission here.
OK. Let's have some fun.
Everybody put their hands on the planchette.
Spirit, if you're here, make yourself known.
Spirit, tell us the first letter of your name.
Sarah.
Spirit...
I feel it.
I feel... I feel the spirit.
It's...
Damn it.
You fucking prick.
I guess no, uh...
You're gonna be fine, Sarah. Just fine. Alright, alright.
I want my money back.
I'm kinda glad that they are.
You know, she's not feeling too well.
Good luck cleaning up the mess, Melissa.
Don't listen to her, man. You're fine.
Yeah. Fuck it.
Dustin. Dustin. Dustin!
Aargh!
- And? - So, ours aren't even halfway.
I did something and now she's in danger and I gotta tell her.
No, no, no. Don't do that.
The last thing we need to do is freak her out any more.
It's never happened to me before, Dustin.
I'm in the fucking dark.
"I'm a professional. People pay me to do this.
I don't know, it could have been more powerful than I thought. Um...
Jesus Christ, Melissa.
Fuck you, Dustin!
- Don't Jesus Christ me. You're the one... - Oh, what's up, Simon?
Hey.
Hey, do you have a minute? I'd like to talk.
No, no, no, no.
She just wants you to clean up a bit more, bro.
Good night, guys.
Good night, baby.
If anything fucking happens, it's on you, Dustin.
Oh... fuck.
We have a situation.
It's Sarah.
Sarah?
You OK?
Honey?
You're... really freaking me out.
Sarah bear?
We should call 911.
She's sleepwalking, man.
The bed's still made.
Fucking shit!
Have you ever suffered from, like, any sort of sleeping disorder, or...?
Not that I know of.
Except for sleeping with Simon. That's a disorder.
What the fuck happened, guys?
I'm sorry.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Wait. What? No.
Simon?
You really don't remember anything?
I remember walking in the hallway.
But I couldn't find it.
Well, it's freaking me the fuck out, so...
What the...?
What?
Honey, you mean more to me than a stupid necklace.
We had a baby.
I can feel it kicking.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck, Sarah?
My finger!
Open the door!
I, uh...
Open the fucking door!
I got the finger, Sarah.
Simon, open the door!
I, uh, can't do it.
You coward!
You coward, you!
My finger.
My finger!
My fucking finger!
My fucking finger!
My fucking finger!
What?
Simon, open the fucking door.
Simon, open up.
'I looked for the light, but I couldn't find it.'
'Simon doesn't believe in anything.'
You're in the dark now.
She gave me the evil eye.
There's a lot of envious people.
I'll do whatever it takes to protect you.
Sarah, you're gonna be just fine.
Find me.
'Simon...
'Simon... Simon...'
'Simon...'
Melissa?
What's going on?
Where's Dustin?
Simon! Simon!
Come here. Come here!
We're pregnant. We're pregnant.
Simon.
Simon.
You didn't protect me.
Why can't you just be happy?
The baby's out.
Simon, dude, open the fucking door, man.
Open up! Sarah!
- Back off! - Simon, open the door!
'Breaking news: police made a grim discovery earlier today
'A 30-year-old woman was found severely mutilated
'and another man was found dead.
'According to police reports,
'32-year-old Simon Fleming and his partner Sarah Johnson
'a severed index finger was found near Simon's dead body.
'According to investigators, the victim locked himself in the bathroom.
'His partner, Sarah, is missing,
'According to investigators,
'Further evidence suggests that Sarah is pregnant.
'The only person that can provide solid information is Dustin Green,
'He is claiming the events were caused
'by his Ouija board and his wife's special candles.'
'It smells exquisite.
'You served me very well.
'But your moons are ending.
'And hers shall begin.
'I will make your last breath be her first.
'And for you...
'For you, death is the end.
'No more!'
Are you OK?
Yeah. Am I special?
Am I special?
Oh, boy. That's good.
Aargh. Wait.
Wait...
Rachel, help me!
Oh, my God. Masha, are you OK?
Who was that guy, Masha?
Here, let's get you cleaned up, OK?
Can you imagine?
I would look like an old witch.
They also worship the Devil and eat children.
My Charlie?
I scared him already.
You're so lucky to have a boyfriend like Charlie.
But you'll find someone. It just takes time.
I just like fucking too much.
Oh, uh... Uh-huh.
It's in the blood.
My grandmother used to fuck everyone back in Romania.
I'm sorry.
But now she's so old, she doesn't care what people think.
Wow. Uh, what's her secret?
Babies' blood.
Definitely.
Hey, Rachel.
Thanks for being so nice to me. Not everyone is.
Yeah.
How's grad school, honey?
He's been great. Charlie's been really supportive.
Yeah, I'm excited to see you guys at Christmas.
Masha?
Masha?
Oh, my God, Masha.
God is angry.
How do you know it's a he?
Uh, if you're talking about that scumbag,
I almost got married to one.
What happened?
He was this narcissistic painter,
We used to work together at the art gallery.
But after we got engaged, he just... changed.
How so?
Like what?
He started following me places.
Um, he would just...
...literally start interrogating me.
which was completely false.
Do you often feel like you're going crazy?
and threw that engagement ring in the dumpsters behind our place.
And the creepiest thing was that...
...the next morning it was back on my night stand.
He had followed me, broke into the place while I was sleeping
and put it there.
Yeah, that's when I got a restraining order
You've always been so nice to me.
I would never want you against me.
Why would I be?
That had nothing to do with you, Masha.
People should be good to me, that's all.
My grandmother's dying.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
But when she dies, I'll gain all her powers.
She's a witch, Rachel.
'Go down that rabbit hole.'
'Charlie's very cute.'
You've always been so good to me.
You can come in.
Hi, I'm looking for Rachel.
- I'm Masha, her roommate. - Oh.
OK. I didn't know she had a roommate.
I'm new.
That's great. Rachel is awesome.
Yeah.
She should back in 45 minutes. Can I take a message”?
No, that's OK.
Can I help you with anything else?
Oh, uh, I'm... I'm really sorry.
She's a really caring person.
I know.
It's just...
even though he was abusive and... and I almost married him
and he gave me this really fantastic engagement ring.
Oh, hey, Masha.
about my ex and the engagement ring?
You told people that that happened to you.
It did happen to me. It's my story.
No, Masha, that did not happen to you.
We were sitting right there and I told you that story.
That is my story about my ex and my engagement ring.
I think you're mistaken. You seem really unstable, Rachel.
You know what? I'm going home for Christmas
We shouldn't have come here.
Will you hide that, please?
Nobody saw anything.
Lighten up.
Jesus, Dustin, you look like shit, man.
Ah, thank you.
What's his problem?
Relationship issues, so...
It's occupied.
Yeah, I figured.
Can you hurry up?
You got people waiting out here.
Someone's in here.
Bitch, what?
Excuse me?
Or what?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Aargh...
But have you fucked her?
Not yet.
- Where the fuck did you learn that? - Let me go.
Who told you that?
One, two, three, Leo.
- Sagittarius. - Oh!
You know, I thought you...
Ah, God...
What the fuck are you?
Hey, hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, stop it.
What is wrong with you?
Calm down. You don't know what we heard that night.
Fuck.
- Do you believe me? - Of course.
But first we're gonna get the fuck out of here, OK?
Oh... Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck. Mel...
Mel... Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
Oh, no. Is she OK?
No, she's, um...
She's dead.
That's so sad.
I'm really sorry.
Are you OK?
I know I'm weird.
So, you forgive me?
Merry Christmas.
I'm coming.
Uh, yes?
How can I help you?
Oh, Masha. I've heard a lot about you.
Um, is everything OK?
I've been trying to reach Rachel.
Oh, I must have arrived before her,
which is weird because I definitely left after her.
Maybe she's picking up Charlie on the way.
I'm so embarrassed.
Rachel invited me over tonight,
because I don't have anywhere to go and...
she didn't want me to spend Christmas alone.
Uh, well... please, come in.
Thank you.
Make yourself comfortable.
She's probably with Charlie. Maybe they're busy.
Fucking.
Maybe that's what's taking them so long.
It smells exquisite. What are you cooking?
So, are you gonna open the present?
I said open it.
Where's my daughter?
Open it.
I call her Rachel.
She is begging for your help.
It's not very nice.
Get out!
Out!
You really don't believe me, do you?
Oh, my God.
You're gonna be really sorry.
Because your dead daughter is under that table.
Go on.
Look.
Get away. I'm calling the police!
I am calling the police. Get away!
You killed my daughter.
You're in the dark now.
'Charlie!'
I've been so jealous of Rachel and how you made her feel so special.
You know, all my life...
I've always felt so weak and vulnerable.
And like no one saw me.
But I realized that I can choose to be strong and powerful.
And I don't need anyone to love me.
I never thought I could get a boyfriend like you.
But I was wrong.
It's OK...
...cos you're my boyfriend now.
Just when things were getting interesting.
Don't move.
T-t-take me to the hospital, please.
Hospitals are for ordinary people.
We are not ordinary people.
I-I don't wanna die.
'Sweet child.
'You will live.
'Girls.
'My beautifuls.
'Bow to the new queen.'
'Breaking news.
'Sarah?'
Sarah?
Hey.
I'm Jessica.
You're here to tell me that I'm crazy.
Sarah, I need you to tell me what happened that night.
Look at my finger.
What happened that night?
Sarah, what happened to your baby?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
But, to know what exactly had happened,
you need evidences.
Sir, it's a boulder.
Okay.
Take a final count.
Okay, madam.
Canal construction was going on.
Workers found few skeletons here and there.
Out of curiosity, when they started digging
Out of shock,
and took control of this land.
Now the investigation has begun.
How many skeletons have you found so far?
Can you tell us what happened here?
Higher authority is pressing us, madam.
To make a guess,
We are from forensic department.
the final count.
What is the count, madam?
Is it 20?
Is it 30?
this is the first time.
Is it 50?
Only the seller knows.
only the cutter knows.
Come what may!
He must not attend the fair this year.
Okay.
It longs for golden news.
During famine,
gazing at the sky
Likewise, we are waiting for him.
What happened?
Wait, I need to look at him.
Let it be, sir.
He is my pal.
Why did he rush?
We visited your office.
We came to the court.
We came to your house.
We tried to contact you.
Finding no other way,
we staged this.
If something had happened
If our town can be saved,
I am willing to die like a stray dog under your car.
we are living in hell.
Two advocates failed to bring him to the fair.
Somehow get him released, sir.
Entire town,
eagerly waiting to see him.
But make him attend the fair, sir.
I beg you, sir.
Listen,
without fear of your death,
you all are fighting to get him out.
Who is that man?
What is he to you?
He is our God.
and considering the behaviour of the accused,
the court has granted a 10 days parole
He can surpass the law.
He should perish before he steps on the soil of Mallanakere.
You are in a disciplinary force.
Obey the order, I say.
My wife is expecting delivery in two weeks.
But you!?
Take one rifle and one round of bullets and leave tomorrow morning.
Sir, I mean...
You all bought tickets. Why are you not hopping in?
I am with you. Come, let's go.
He is hand cuffed.
Nothing to worry. Come let's go.
I mean...
Listen, conductor.
Sir.
He is hand cuffed.
No way.
Return our money. We will leave.
How can I perform my duties without the cooperation of the public?
Get in. Quick.
There is only one bus available.
What to do now?
Releasing Kaveri water to Tamilnadu is postponed.
Madhuri in Mysuru!
A stampede occurred during the shooting of the film Dil.
They deployed me to look after this criminal.
You break piggy bank, you get coins.
You dig soil, you get skeletons.
or due to some devastating disease.
You call this a news!?
Are you taking us directly to heaven?
What the hell!?
Someone has blocked road.
Please help me in clearing the road.
There was one prisoner with a constable.
Where is he?
Come let's go. - Let's go.
[Indistinct shout]
Who are those people?
Forget about them. Tell me, who are you?
I just checked your number.
I've brought you till here.
What is your name, mister?
My name is...
I am from Bheemanahalli.
We had our own furnace.
People from neighbouring towns,
Axe for wood chopping,
I used to make all the tools.
Right from vegetables chopper to
sharp swords.
Metals used to smelt in my furnace
and get hammered by my hand.
and workmanship is my God.
Someone has killed my Belli!
Have you gone nuts, Katera?
I made this with my own hands.
It communicates with me.
For last year's harvest,
I made four machetes along with this one.
Do you remember?
[Mute blabbering]
[Mute blabbering]
[Mute blabbering]
Worshipped by the giants.
Master.
Without any age discrimination,
You humiliated our Changa who was seeking for a role.
Is this fair?
Is this fair?
If you keep giving roles to relatives and family members,
what should a talent like Changlu do?
I'll see how you will execute the play.
I heard it loudly!
Nothing, brother-in-law.
Our Changlu is fond of acting.
So I was asking the director for a role.
Listen,
He can be taught lines too.
But he is mute.
How can I teach him talking!?
Master, you don't know him.
He can beat all of you in acting.
Show your acting skills to him.
[Mute blabbering]
Shut up I say.
What did he blabber? What did you understand?
Brother-in-law,
he will be happy holding a spear on stage.
[Mute blabbering]
He is demanding for the Hiranya Kashyap role.
Brother-in-law!
Nothing like that. Let's go.
Please forgive me.
Let's run away, quick.
Let's go.
Oh my dear child!
I thought my life would be better after you were born.
Dasaiah! Dasaiah!
Pay a visit to my home tomorrow morning.
May he live long!
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
Mother?
He will never change.
Please stop crying, I beg you.
He kicked me out mercilessly!
Whose side I should take? My husband's?
or my brother's?
What curry is this?
Grains curry.
Serve me please.
Look,
I beg you! Please shut up, sister.
How can I?
Your bro-in-law loves Bengal gram dosa.
I don't know how! But go fix this.
And now the cockfight begins!
I left my self-respect and came to you.
Don't play with me.
Men will be having thousands of issues between them.
But it is not fair to drag women into this.
Yes, I do drag women into this.
Ring masters need whip to tame his animals.
For petty reasons you send my sister to our home!
Indeed! She is good in that.
she does these diplomacies very smartly.
People have gathered.
Let's get inside and discuss.
Yes... Changlu!
Enjoy your drink.
Oh! Brother-in-law!?
For this gathering sake...
She has immense love and care towards you!
We are married for 16 years
She suffered abortion three times.
I don't want any child when he is with him."
Later we got blessed with this child.
For us,
you are our elder son.
This is my town.
These people are my people.
Everyone in the town,
believed in 'Work is worship'.
And lived in harmony.
But...
Hear me out everyone.
Just like every year,
at lord's house with the produce.
Hear me out everyone.
Nanjunda? - 8 acres, sir.
80 bags.
Yes sir.
Siddhanna?
3 acres 30 bags, sir.
The thing is...
You thought we don't remember..
and planned to fool us?
I am going through rough times,
so I thought of repaying it next time.
Every year you should clear your dues.
Ranga? - Yes, brother.
Collect two more bags from him. - Okay, brother.
Hulagappa, 1 acre, 10 bags.
Crops got affected by pests.
yield is hardly enough for me and my family.
Kindly accept only 5 bags this year.
You have only grown as much as we need.
Unload them all.
Please no. I beg you.
It is we who work on the fields
with our blood and sweat throughout the year.
Don't forget, the God is watching you.
Don't snatch everything from us.
Kindly give us something to survive.
I provide boats.
I provide nets.
I provide food.
You return after three days,
I beg you!
You are struggling to give 10 bags per one acre, right?
Alright.
Hereafter, per acre...
give twelve bags.
My lord,
Why punish us for his mistake?
He was blabbering so much,
yet you all kept quiet.
You all kept quiet.
and get their thumb impressions.
Let them work if they want
They are all like snakes,
Devaraya is competing me in every way possible.
Okay my child.
Take care.
Shanbhog,
To continue your profession,
you have your son.
She is brilliant in studies. Let her pursue education.
Oh you sinner!
Father, I was giving Gograsa.
Kariya's shadow fell on me.
That's why I am cleansing myself.
Answer me now.
The machete has become blunt.
The handle is loose.
If you re-work on it,
it will become sharp again.
Shall I sharpen it?
But he is answering about the machete.
Oh god!
People express their love by offering flowers.
All these years,
Nothing will affect you.
You will rise and set everyday.
You are not the earth.
You are a landlord's daughter!
Shall I tell you one thing?
Say hundred and one thing, sister.
Who is stopping you?!
Putraju.
Brother?
You are this tiny,
Forging metals has turned your heart to metal.
Take this.
What is this?
Music and rhythm have the power to bring rain.
may all this kindle love in your heart.
No! No! No!
Make some free time and listen to it.
Sure I will.
One kiss.
Bloody you!
Here comes the song.
Love arose without knowing!
You are Shiva and I am Parvati.
He is handsome. He is attractive.
He is handsome. He is attractive.
Love arose without knowing!
You are Shiva and I am Parvati.
He is handsome. He is attractive.
Like butter from milk
Like gold from Kolar
Like the earth touched by the monsoon
Like gluten of Bombe Mithai
He has fragrance and sweetness.
You are my breath.
Keep me in your heart.
I make our life beautiful.
He is divine like Sita's husband Rama.
He is beautiful like Kannada alphabet.
Love arose without knowing!
He is handsome. He is attractive.
Basavaiah?
Mahalingaiah?
Kalaiah?
and escalate the issue?
We don't slit tongues.
We slit throats.
Basavaraja?
Kariya, come here.
Yes sir.
Make thumb impression here.
The government is providing free fertilizer.
Not just here, it is happening every where.
Devaraya from Bheemanahalli,
he is boasting off like a philanthropist!
The government has realised this.
That is why,
to provide food to the poor,
But you are snatching their food!
It will not work for long, father.
One fine day they will revolt.
Wait and see.
they will remain slaves and us landlords.
They are just slippers with souls.
If we need to walk,
we must press them.
We are not priests.
Bloody you!
Sister, join me and take a bath.
He is jealous that you are asking me instead of him.
Take this. Make it fast.
Fine, step aside.
Oh, you got a fly tyre!
This must be your doings.
Stop.
Alright, give me a kiss.
I'll give you a ride.
Get lost, I say.
They are selling them to farmers.
Won't anybody going to question them?
We have elders in our town.
They know exactly what to do.
Why do you seek unnecessary trouble?
Just ignore and leave.
I am an idiot!
They will oppress you till your last breath.
You get oppressed.
Siddanna? - Yes.
Bring hot snacks for Katera.
Okay, brother.
Brother-in-law.
Is it true that landlord is distributing fertilizer?
Today morning, I gave thumb impression and brought it.
See.
But Prabha said,
Are we relatives to the government to get free fertiliser?
I agree she is a little mischievous.
But she doesn't lie in these matters.
She is highly educated.
She cares about our people.
Indeed.
Her face!
Her bosom!
Her waist!
If I were in Katera's place,
instead of forging the iron,
I would have forged her.
Inanimate bottle makes noise when chocked,
Otherwise...
True man should work hard.
Should not think dirty.
Sir,
If there is any,
You may not trust us.
But I am an honest man.
Mahadevi, bring buttermilk.
Take it.
"When you voluntarily make a marriage proposal
the groom becomes arrogant.
Just take it.
Mahadevi!
We are not superiors just because we are born in this family.
Clothes we wear,
food we consume,
culture and traditions have made us superiors.
and provide sacred offerings.
Tell your daughter that we have huge differences.
My lord,
Unknowingly,
I'll educate him.
We must strike while the iron is hot.
Basava?
Yes my lord.
Yes my lord.
Father, don't show your power over this poor guy.
Because dogs are loyal, we don't feed them on our plate.
We must teach them how to respect the position.
Please punish me instead.
Father, please no.
You please come inside.
Get inside.
Come.
Please stop.
Please no.
Please no.
Please stop, my lord.
Please no.
Basava.
please God and become superior.
If you had forgiven this innocent boy's fault,
Kate.. K..
Slap me for the mistake.
But don't be silent.
I am dying here.
Caste and hierarchy are created by them.
Not by me.
But love?
that my love would blossom in this fire.
I didn't see caste or wealth in love.
If I ever to marry,
I would only marry you.
Prabha,
our life is in this furnace.
Beyond this lies,
your comfortable life.
Between you and I
If I try to cross it,
People who lit camphors
cannot comprehend the heat of the furnace.
Get going.
Brother, Prabha!
To be with you,
I live with you.
I die belonging to you.
You are my companion of many births.
You are like a sunflower.
I safeguard you in my heart.
You are my companion of many births.
My heart is filled with joy.
I am hearing wedding music.
You are my companion of many births.
I need more time.
Please sit.
There is nothing to investigate,madam.
No sir.
According to our studies, this took place a decode ago.
There is something fishy about all this.
As per my experience,
I am asking you to report it as natural death.
You continue with your studies for your satisfaction.
But the result will be the same.
i.e natural death.
Okay.
Give me time till evening.
Sir.
Sir,
Is it possible to find out the cause of death by studying bones?
Yes, it is possible.
That is their expertise.
I hope there are no holes in it.
You walked three hours straight in this rough terrain yet you don't look tired!
Imagine how you were in your younger days!
You had strength, workmanship, a loving town.
Even after all this,
how did you go behind bars?
he can take this buffalo with him, which is here for last 15 years.
Otherwise,
bow down to the goddess,
Look over there, Katera.
you not only a sharp machete,
Katera,
No brother.
Katera!
No, mom.
You please go home. Listen to me.
What happened?
What happened, sister?
What happened?
Leave him. Leave him, I say.
Bro-in-law, leave him.
you are not a judge nor a ruler.
Shut your filthy mouth.
Why did you touch him?
You are not worthy to stand before me
How dare you?!
Or else I'll shoot him.
This year
This is my order.
What if something bad happens to you?!
Are you listen to me?
Oh god!
I am responsible for all this.
knowingly
By doing so,
you have to revolt.
Sir, this is steel.
Stainless steel.
not just men
In front of this mighty steel
But only Kalinga serpents
You still have time
But,
One should face the war.
just strength is not enough.
Hey Rudra?
Women from our Agrahara
Katera!
Soil became fertile due to rain.
But
a volcano of anger erupted.
But here,
But now,
Sir,
Sir,
This is not leadership.
Serfdom
feudalism
untouchability and etc are the evil practices of the society,
In order to eradicate them
Land reforms Act has been passed.
As per this Act
farmers who are cultivating the land
should submit their lease agreement to the concerned Taluk officer
Yes, we agree.
Hear me out everyone.
Hear me out everyone.
What is this?!
Listen mister,
Whoever
But now,
See you.
tomorrow is ours.
Yes of course.
The soil
during the fair,
Hey Katera!
This hand
Now, the land is ours.
belongs to us.
Katera!
Sir?
The lease we gave
Look at this.
Look at this, sir.
Not just one or two
Madam,
You are behaving so carelessly!
Sir,
If we fail
Some cowherd.
Hey police!
What is this!?
Kneel down over there.
You please leave, officer.
Sir,
I've a family.
Where you think you going?
That Katera!
Listen to me.
Let's go back.
What's wrong with you, idiot!
Not a cat.
Tiger!
You better step aside.
your daughter Prabha and Katera
Look, Prabha
Today
No!
Tell me, how can I repay your debt?
Please telle me.
A for Apple. - A for Apple.
B for ball. - B for ball.
C for cat. - C for cat.
D for Dog. - D for Dog.
Paddu, hope you are doing well.
How is mom doing?
What about dad's anger?
What is this, Prabha?
Invite him home and offer a meal.
No. My father doesn't know that I am here.
Just a minute.
Seems like you have forgotten this old in-law after the arrival of new in-law.
Nothing like that.
I've Hiranya Kashyap in my body and soul.
I'll perform in such away that people should remember me by Bhakta Prahlad play.
Changla!? Changla!?
In a couple of minutes
Bhakta Prahlada drama shall begin.
I request everyone to be seated.
Hey this is Changlu!
He cannot even speak! Why is he on the stage?
Who am I?
Son of Kashyapa Brahma.
Born from the womb of Diti.
I am a conquistador who conquered death.
I vanquished the swank of the children of Aditi.
Earth quakes when I step forward.
The sky trembles when I raise my head.
When I raise my hand, the whole creation shivers.
When the creation of fourheaded Brahma is following my orders
after all, my son
the son whom I fathered
my son who is entitled to continue our clan
Shame!
What a shame!
You call this a life!?
What an ill struck fate!
What an ill struck fate!
I thought I am the mighty!
What superpower is haunting me?
What superpower has made my son my foe?
What a surprise!?
What superpower has stopped him from embracing death?
What superpower has made me hang my head in shame?
Yes! It's him!
That Evil!
Hey Hari!
Wicked man!
Traitor!
You entered my son's mind.
You messed with his mind.
if you are really the perfect supreme being
show yourself.
Show yourself to me.
I am not Hiranya Kashyapa.
I am not Hiranya Kashyapa.
Hail Changlu!
Please forgive us. That is...
I am not upset that I lost my role.
Seeing your performance,
I couldn't clap my hands.
This made me upset.
Brother-in-law!
Brother-in-law!
You held your father's reputation high.
Yes you did.
Yes.
Sir,
we have been supporting you from the beginning.
We provided you man power.
Is this fair?!
From the beginning
We have protected
your throne.
What else can I do to help as a legislator?
Madam Indira has passed this Act.
It is Mr Urs who is executing it.
Sir,
ask them how much money they want to stop this Act getting executed.
He is very kind towards the poor.
If this Act is executed
millions of families will have a stable future.
To safeguard your power,
snatching our power is not fair.
Mr Krishna,
Tell them that power is not permanent.
Persistence is of no use.
Come what may! They are not going to revert the decision.
The wrong way.
The government will send a survey team.
Make your sure
lessees should not come near your fields.
If lessees don't show up
that land will remain with you.
This assurance is more than enough!
You just be like a cool breeze.
We are ready to flame up like fire.
Those farmers
My lord.
In other villages,
But,
Indeed.
Blushing, huh?
Begin the search. - Yes sir.
Rachappa, go search over there.
Yes sir.
Officer!?
I'll explain.
Search every nook and corner.
Check there. - Yes sir.
What about here?
Search every nook and corner.
Hey stop.
Search every nook and corner.
This is our goddess. I beg you.
What is this?!
Arrest him.
Someone has done it intentionally.
Stop. Where are you going?
We want to see our brother.
Under the iron hammering sound,
Officer,
instead of questioning me why I chopped it,
ask me why I stand for farmers?
I can answer.
You cannot make me spill the beans.
How dare you!
You bloody!
Come.
Kati!?
Oh my god!
What is this, Kati!?
Have they gone insane!?
Sister,
in big shots' game
we are just pawns.
Prabha.
farmers should not stop working in their fields.
Let any supremo come,
you should make sure
Goddess Kateravva will show us a way.
You have to pay as much as we have said.
This is a sandalwood case.
It is a false allegation, sir.
I don't want to handle this case.
It is a false allegation, sir.
The court demands evidence not truth.
He has only one option left.
Ask him to confess his crime.
I can request the judge to reduce the punishment.
How are you, father?
Forget about me.
What brings you here?
I'll go bring it.
Katera is facing punishment without committing any crime.
Someone has framed him purposefully.
From to weeks,
Kindly
I beg you, father.
get him released.
Stop right there.
Are you not aware of which caste should be served in which glass?
When the god of who gets worshipped,
becomes a stepping stone,
You shunned us away.
You were dead to me the day you shunned us away.
Greetings, sir. - Hello.
Since he got caught with the goods,
it has a strong evidence
Now, you have only option.
We were depending on Katera.
But he got imprisoned without committing any crime.
Now Prabha is visiting the court.
we must take a concrete decision.
Let us pay as much he asks and work on our fields.
Look at the old man!
Hey old man!
Are you coming here to take your life?
Don't be so stupid.
Get lost.
So much courage!
How did they muster it?
Retreat! Run.
You are getting released.
and surrendered himself.
Who is that, officer?
They used to exploit us. Now they are threatening us.
It is because we gave lenience to them.
Growth of a nation depends on its farmers.
Devotees eat the same food.
Soldiers eat the same food.
Labour class eat the same food.
And that food is provided by farmers.
Food is seen as god.
The one who creates that god is farmer.
When united
Let us be united hereafter.
We have no king to rule us.
What we have is
this lush green
Mother earth.
We are her soldiers.
green is our breath.
Green is our robe.
Green is our...
flag.
He is as strong as a boulder.
Don't dare to face him.
He has a troop to back him up.
He coined "Green is our breath"
O son of soil, listen
you are our proud flag.
This rebellious spirit is building the nation.
The whole town
has united as one.
they are marching forward.
they think zamindar system is their right.
out of fear of losing their right
they have taken these steps.
On top it,
officers who were meant to support us
With no other option left,
we have approached you.
Miss, look
this is not a recent order.
This Act
From tomorrow, you need not visit Taluk office.
You show your tenancy papers to them.
They will examine them.
You need not worry at all.
I
She spoke confidently in front of the District collector.
She mentioned all the law points.
She made the DC dumbstruck.
She has mustered too much courage!
Greetings my lord.
We have disputes between us.
not respect.
You are our lord forever.
Respect towards you will never decrease.
Your presence is a must for every fair, festival and occasions.
We are getting married next week.
On the same day, government officials are giving us land documents.
Villagers will be happy if you hand over papers to them.
Few people addressed her madam.
Now she has started behaving like Madam Indra!
I am really shocked to see her head-weigh!
Once a slave
If don't answer them,
they will keep questioning us, my lord.
Boss!
We have a job.
Hey Kati?
I'll be back in a minute.
Simply stay put.
Get inside. Right now.
Hey Kati?
Hey Katera,
My fate!
Speak of the devil!
You are the fourth generation.
What you mean by generations?
Forget it.
Then there will be bombarding of pecks.
Today is our last day as lovers.
From tomorrow we are husband and wife.
Today's peck is love.
Tomorrow's peck is a duty.
I want it today.
For that, you should say "serve meal".
Hey Rangappa.
Nothing like that, Katera.
You were busy in wedding arrangements.
Hey brother-in-law,
come inside.
How can it be?
Let's go.
Spill the beans.
They are northies.
They are well diggers.
They are called 'Laal Khooni Danav'.
It means 'Bloodthirsty monsters'.
What's their business here?
To execute the people who have tenancy papers
that Devaraya has hired them.
Tonight.
This landlord has gone insane!
We have worked in his fields for years.
Now he wants to kill us.
Let's go. Let's alert the town.
What?
That means, they came here many days ago.
Now they know all the entry points of our village.
They are not in finger counting numbers.
They are a huge battalion.
Brother-in-law,
I don't know.
Turn around.
Take off your mask.
Remove the mask, I say.
You?!
Yes I will.
I will.
We are ready.
Let there be elders, women, children...
Our swords shall taste their blood.
Grant us your permission.
Hail Bhavani.
Hail Bhavani.
Katera!
Boss has ordered us
But one particular head should be presented at his feet.
That head...
is it yours?
By the time I reach you you will know
whether it is me or not.
I am hundreds steps away from you.
Here we have one person for every step.
You are seeing only me.
But from my view point,
you all are caught in my hands.
We are 108 men in total.
Hundred doesn't matter to me.
Because,
you will cease to exist.
that offering remained unfulfilled.
Today, I am going to make that offer.
Go chop his head off.
Let's do it.
Chop him off to pieces.
Attack!
O goddess,
killing men
is a sin.
But,
kindly forgive me.
Kindly,
What is this?!
Everyone is here to attend the wedding!
How to get in without getting noticed?
You are right.
Cover your face.
Katera!
Kati! Kati! Kati!
Look at her!
Someone stabbed this goddess to death in the dark!
How could you leave me like this?
Did you seek my consent before leaving me?
What to do when the light is gone?
My soul longs for its soul mate.
Untimely death has taken away my beloved.
How could you leave me like this?
Take what you want, sister.
Kati!
May you be blessed by goddess Ganga and Yamuna.
So many unspoken words are still whispering in my heart.
I am now an ocean without waves and a body without breath.
Grant me permission. I seek forgiveness.
How could you leave me like this?
Did you seek my consent before leaving me?
What to do when the light is gone?
My soul longs for its soul mate.
Untimely death has taken away my beloved.
For innocent souls,
is there no value?
A life that does not value other lives
should not be alive.
Or should I feel sorry for Prabha?
People flee away in rough times.
But you fought for your village.
Greeting you is not enough.
You should be worshipped!
You are the god Katerappa.
Till now I worked for salary.
After seeing you, I want to work for the society,
Let's go.
Let's go.
How do you know all this?
You found 107 skeletons.
But the band which came from the north
You are still young
you should live long.
there was love which can transform a beast like me.
I saw the future of my villagers.
I was supposed to end up behind bars for committing murders
but he showed me the path to education.
I was supposed to become a killing machine.
Madam,
if you report this
a natural death
My god who is behind bars
will get released one fine day.
Otherwise,
I beg you madam.
in your hands.
You asked for some details
pertaining to an old incident occurred in Bheemanahalli?
It's okay.
Brother-in-law!
Devaraya is no more.
Kalegowda made our village a living hell!
Yes Katera.
Our land has become barren.
Ponds and lakes are dead dry.
Entire village is now a zombie land!
and lord Vishnu has Chakra
Ole Mari should be applied.
Ole Mari has its own weightage!
And you have your own, Katera.
But it came out.
I built a wall to prevent it from entering our farmland.
It smashed the wall.
He cannot even touch it.
He should touch it.
Yes indeed!
Bring the sacrificial buffalo.
Katera.
Look at you now!
How was the prison life?
I pity you.
After we have our food,
have a gluten free meal,
and get lost from here.
not for the spirit.
This undying spirit
If I choke while eating,
or you get caught in my hand,
I drink only blood.
Change is inevitable.
Yes, indeed.
But,
not this much.
Paddu?!
Mom?
Mom?
Where is mom, Paddu?
Paddu?
Are you hurt?
Are you feeling the pain, sister?
The pain which you caused by stabbing us
is more agonising than this, sister.
By shunning us away,
you humiliated us for life.
I am getting married tomorrow.
I've not committed any mistake, Paddu.
But the reputation of the family which nurtured you with love and care
Kindly let me live.
I beg you.
I want to live with him.
If you wanted to have fun
I would have hooked you up with someone from our own caste.
But!
You had lust towards that dog!
Reputation of our parents
is not just spoiled
you ruined it.
Paddu! Paddu!
Don't abandon me!
I am getting married tomorrow.
I want to live.
Kati!
Kati!
Yes,
I killed Prabha.
More than love
our caste is important to us.
We can console ourselves if our daughter dies!
But we cannot accept when she elopes with someone like you.
She was my sister.
I would have forgiven her if she had lost her chastity within our community.
But she spoiled the sanctity of our caste by marrying you.
Even if I had ten sisters
and if all had committed such a filthy sin
just like I killed her
By gaining knowledge
became a brahmin.
The light which was lit to identify professions
But
used that fire to burn down the humanity
The greatest clan of all is
the human race.
The greatest respect of all is
the self-respect.
But, Prabha
She had equality.
She had literacy.
She had ambitions.
Instead of worshipping that goddess
you killed her!
No one requests god
to make them born in a particular caste.
Every child is equal to God.
Label it with humanity.
Label it with love, equality and compassion.
and the village will prosper.
The hatred and fury created by this Ole Mari
The darkness calls to you.
Give me a helper
Oh!
Gotcha?
E! Pinocchio, well, do not peep.
So, donut, where are the wedding doves?
What doves?
That's not mine.
If you call names, I'll pour this potion on you.
And then! This is my present to you.
Hear.
Pah you! Looks like you messed up something.
Not bad.
Good for small aircraft.
Where are you running around again?
I'm going to stick my tail in someone's gills!
Wan, I came up with the idea to launch into the sky instead of doves.
Well?
In!
Wow!
Some kind of witchcraft again?
Ordinary butterfly.
And giant powder. Haven't heard of this one?
- Not. - Here.
Krutyamba! Vasilisa will love it.
Vanya !!!
Van! It seems I've scolded the giant's powder somewhere.
Vasilisa, get people out of the square!
Dear Belogorsk and Belogorsk people!
Disinfection carried out, you can return to your usual activities.
Jet Lord, help needed!
Oops!
Medusa in my mouth.
Vasilisa! Throw it on me.
Vanya!
Listen, that's enough, huh?
What's wrong? BUT?
Destroyed everything. It took a long time to make soup out of it.
Everyone has enough.
How can you sleep here?
So it's all exciting.
Everything will be fine.
Never thought about it. I do not remember.
Mmm.
Sweet dream, sweet dream.
Let him dream about you.
Vania! Trouble is coming. I smell the darkness, oh I smell it.
No laughing matter now, Vanya.
Don't vibrate grandpa.
Rogaleb won, Galina will not come here. Be afraid.
Go to sleep.
Ivan.
I think it's ready.
To be honest, I've never been so sure.
Very well.
Ltd…
I know this face.
I made the wrong choice in life, I really want to talk about it, but I won’t.
Before.
And now, as a friend, advice to you.
About how I gained my immortality, you know.
And what happened on the shore of the black lake, I had never told anyone before.
When I came to the lake, something strange happened to me.
And when the Light had already almost won, I suddenly realized that I had never been happy.
And since then, dark times have come in Belogorye.
If you think about it, then you still have a choice.
Time to sleep.
[Snoring]
Let her go! I speak well.
And when you already calm down old.
- Eee! - Stand!
- What happened? - Vasilisa was kidnapped.
- Who? - Our old friend.
- The toad is gone! - Have you forgotten me?
Come on, baby, push it! Leaving!
Have you seen? This! Black! Here is strength!
What's black? Galya is not one or what?
The darkness filled her. She is now stronger than ever.
See how it shakes. Suddenly you will fall into Vasilisa.
High. Do not jump like that ... turtledove.
Capital of Russian Federation. (Capital of Russian Federation.)
Get it, cracker. This is a foreign language.
What's in the bag?
Walnuts.
Round, come here.
Well, go away!
Du-u-ui!
- Svyatozar !!! - Ah!
- Reload! - BUT!
- Give me nuts! - Yeah.
The witch is losing her powers! Granny pull up.
Hey, black-faced gudgeon spilled the floor of the mortar for me.
- Where's she? - Dashed in there.
Hey! Svyatozar.
Vasilisa!
Where's she?
You saw that Galina began to weaken!
Grandma, honey, let's do something.
Svetozar you're a wizard, let's conjure something.
What's this?
Why are you talking, tyuryuhailo?
Not!
Many of the magical creatures in this world took refuge in dark times.
How you were crushed!
Hey, stump Koshcheev! Are you alive there?
Alive! Where are we? Boat what?
Wait here, I am now.
Forgot yours again!
Well, what a tourist went.
Dear. Let's get up.
Rise, rise, rise!
There is a river everywhere. Don't get out.
You need to find a helmsman to land on the shore.
Well, yes.
Now…
I told him so, of course.
Hey, are you deaf?
Oh, listen, what's the point. One hundred years already...
Aw, fool.
Hey man, wake up. Come on dear.
How to find Ivan? Your stump. bad? BUT?
Well, what are you waving your little hands?
It means, if yes, jump up, if not, sit down. Understood?
But who is there, Ivan?
And who then?
What's your head there?
It's clear. Probably, where your head is, there the rest.
Well, what are you talking about, stump.
We would somehow go ashore, but here the water is all around. See?
I'll get wet, like ... Ah-ah-ah!
O. What did you miss?
Don't be sad bubble.
We lost Koshchei and Kolobok.
They won't disappear. Vasilisa needs to be found.
What got up? Shut up. Go!
Like normal people, let's go on a magical yellow chariot.
And my dove?
Just sit down and don't make noise.
The main thing is that it is not demolished under the renovation program.
- Let's go! - Go.
Our chariot has arrived.
Child, let me go.
Cool! King of the White Walkers!
What are you carrying a child. Come on quickly...
Mom, thanks! You're the best!
Yes, this is, along the way, Igorka. liked the pencils.
I always tell mine, kids don't need any gadgets.
Well. Where are we?
Hey you. Let me climb on you, I'll tell you where to go.
What's not? What-no head you will have.
There are legs - you don't need a mind.
I wish I could close up such shutters in my turtledove!
Relatives from Kostroma came to Moscow to see.
Toko it. Take it easy with the Firebird.
They are capricious and touchy birds.
There is no cashier.
And you tell him on this tablet speaking.
How can I talk to him? He doesn't have that board.
And we will fix this now.
O! Open the window!
Was Vasilisa not allowed to send such a board?
Therefore, the bird will not find it either.
How can I call now?
We need to move from economy to comfort.
How restless you are.
In vain you started all this. Vanya will tear your head off for me!
For you?
Yes !?
Closer to mother?
How?
He wasn't ready yet.
Everything has its time.
So. So, so... It's... What's it? Shy. Drive her away, you bastard.
The food nearly ate me up.
Well, what is there? Far more?
So we'll be stale by the time we get there.
We need such a thing.
Ivan rode it in Belogorye.
Not understood! Eh, what are you?
I need your iron horse.
Go away, bearded woman!
If you do that again, I'll bite your nose off.
Not. It's better in a mortar.
Is this the Firebird's nest?
The bird lives curly.
Hello, honey!
And we pass through the frame.
Hey! Where!? What's wrong! Stand! Stand!
First, we have penetration here.
Enough, child. Well, what are you doing?
Where is your button?
Hey kid, where did you go?
Let there be light!
You will answer me for everything!
Igorek, go to dinner.
Hang a little more.
I command you! Take me to Ivan Muromets!
And if you do not obey, I will flog you and your foolish servant.
Clear!?
Cool, right? Click on the nose.
Aw! If you touch me again, I'll bite off my finger.
God! How much did your dad buy Chinese nonsense!
- Don't argue with me! - Woman!
Hello, are you still here?
Woman, stop!
Wow!
Who else are you?
What is this, Kirkorov?
How did you get here? BUT?
How did you get here?
We've come to talk! How are you there? Philip Zhar-ptitsevich?
I don't want to talk to anyone! Get out of here!
- Drive them away, Lena! - We're leaving.
Everything is quiet!
It's me, Svetozar!
- Svetozar? - Yes!
Oh… Indeed, Svetozar. Didn't acknowledge.
You will be rich, Svetozar.
And what kind of peasant is uncouth with you?
Ivan Muromets. Elijah's son.
"Listen. - Hmm.
His father was textured. And this one...
Ugly. Yes!?
We have a case for you, swan.
They stole Ivan's bride in Belogorye, but they transferred it here.
Your Belogorsk affairs have not interested me for a long time.
And she herself ran away ... from this.
Hey you? Goose... skinned!
Give it to me!
We found your pen at the crime scene.
And anyway, who are they?
Well, let's get out of here!
Lena!
Lena! Began!
The Firebird brings an egg into the world. It only happens once in their lives.
Gives an answer to any question.
- Generally on any? - Yes.
Now I've seen everything!
- Looks like me? - Yes!
- Yes? - Yes.
You are my favorite!
Your magnificence rehearsal has begun. It's time for you to get on stage.
Well, what are you digging? Bring the grain!
- Vanka! Need to go. - Wait.
We need this egg.
What is it you ate, swan?
Grains... Human-turning...
Bald beaver.
And he didn’t give me anything, except crucian carp.
Mm! Lena! Give him grain. A little bit.
Beauties. Now I have legs too.
True, not as long as yours, but ... nothing too! Yes?
O! Granny! Now your crucian will swim away.
My fish! But I haven't done anything yet.
Get out! Get out of here!
I'm old, now I'll turn you into a coal!
We're leaving. We're leaving.
How do you walk on these sticks? BUT!
Shut up because of you we almost burned all of us.
Everything, everything. Good dogging.
- Hide. - You stole it?
Come on, these chickens will still be demolished.
Hide, hide! They will find out the loss and pull out all my legs.
Wow!
You'll regret it, you wretch!
- Hello. I will destroy you and your entire tribe!
Shut up already!
Hello girl.
Why so long?
What is this, bread?
Never throw away bread! Understood?
She doesn't understand anything.
BUT! It's clear. Holy fool.
Let's go look for Ivan. - Tora!
Oh, Vanya, Vanya, Vanya!
I heard that each egg has its own approach.
Everyone has a special secret.
Your approach?
Well, hold on!
Got it.
Oh! Oh! Moms!
Well, now it will definitely work.
Yes.
If Koschey were here, he would suggest how to open the egg.
Your bird didn't fly.
- It went hard. - All right, let's go.
Could you say goodbye?
Somehow impolite.
What a beauty!
What did I loose. I'm wondering how to open an egg.
- Give me a tyrkalka. - Here, take it.
Hello.
And you are stubborn!
Even though it's cute.
We could make friends.
I am not friendly with snakes.
Y! A. Ah!
My eyes popped!
People, here the inscription appeared.
I will open tomorrow.
Tomorrow is still two hours away.
Let's wait.
My mouth is dry!
Go drink.
Van, can you make this colored wall again?
- Che! - Go get changed!
Not!
It's time.
Come on, dear!
I will open tomorrow.
And we tried to open it again today.
It will only open tomorrow!
How are we going to open it tomorrow? This is some nonsense!
Stop thinking.
Need to do something! Vasilisa must be saved!
Where to look for it?
Golden ray of sunshine
And between us again
suddenly there was a wall.
The night will pass, the morning will come clear
I know happiness awaits us with you.
The night will pass, the rainy season will pass.
The sun will rise.
The birds will stop singing.
You touched the light of the stars.
Through blizzards and sorrows
you hear my voice!
Believe me, honey, I really want this too.
For him to save you.
The sun will rise...
You need to save those you love.
Oh Yaga! How to live with you! From your soup all the gills reduce!
Stunned!
"What?" - Ostolben.
- Ouch! - It's an aging decoction.
- Ah. Oh!
- Ah! - You are a witch!
Don't worry, it won't be long.
Svetozar! Get the egg.
Yes?
Fu!
Run Run.
Oops!
Oh!
On!
- What did you do? - Ah... You... I'm going now.
My little fishes! Let me introduce myself!
Well, you berry start again? Well, I'm just looking for an egg!
Or maybe they saw an egg?
Looking for adventure on your tail!
Here is an egg.
Am I tired?
Come on, clean up your bony little hands!
What, am I, a fool, in vain believed you?
I ...
Kikimory.
Galya! Only you were missing.
Don't mess with me or you'll regret it!
At least they did some good.
People.
This black guy just attacked me!
Vania! We know how to open an egg!
The waterman came up with.
Yes! I remembered about kikimors here.
To remember without me? You are an empty minnow!
Listen to grandma! Stop muddying the water!
I don't know you at all.
- What are you, mold... - Oh!
- Swamp mold! - Stop!
Swamp mold.
- What kind of kikimora? - Kikimors are subject to time.
They were expelled from Belogorye because they stole time from people.
Understood. Yeah.
I'm sick, Koshcheyushka! I'm dying.
[Phone rings] - Oh-oh-oh! Still chirping inside.
Iron horse, out, saddled! Where are you?
Well, ask someone. Let me know, find it. Everything.
Here. Lair kikimore.
Yeah. Time is stolen. Well, the place.
Svetozar!
Vasilisa! How are you here?
I managed to escape.
Let's go soon!
You better be with me.
So there they are! Won.
Look, Van, see? This is human time.
His kikimoras are stolen and then hidden in a magic crystal.
And how can they help us?
Hold on. I'll go make a deal.
Sorry.
Good afternoon!
Young man, take a ticket.
No, you did not understand. I just ask.
Coupon!
Dear, the device is not working.
Who can't wait there? Let them wait.
Well, did you hear? Wait!
The kettle will boil, the device will be connected.
Take a ticket. Come up.
Hey!
Kikimora!
Don't talk to me about teeth.
Why are you yelling at me?
Did I not understand? We are completely closed!
We're having lunch!
Wan!
Wan!
Vanya!
Wan-Wan-Wan-Wan!
Van, don't, don't.
How to get to tomorrow?
Well.
Square, hero, I beg you! Do not do that!
How are we? How do you say live without it? BUT?
Don't lose!
I beg you, do not lose!
We can't live without him!
We take people very little time.
We need to eat something, you know!
Don't, Van.
How dare you? Give back the egg, thief!
What are you watching? Burn them!
Hey feathery!
Stop it.
Forgot who I am?
Do not destroy the immortal!
We give up.
Fly while you're safe.
All in the nest.
Well, how are you here?
O! He has legs.
What would you do without me?
So what to do... with this time crystal?
Come on, give it here.
Let's.
Sui tuda. Love, love.
There is!
The testicle opened, what next?
Ask!
We can fix it. It is important to ask the right question.
Where is Vasilisa?
- I'm after him! - And Svetozar?
I don’t know, Vasilisa needs to be saved!
Yaga, where is your turtledove?
Come on, come on, move!
Galya! And you shoot worse than you clean!
Like this!
Well, we must save Ivan!
Ripe!
That's it, Gal, let's go down.
Not! But I suggest someone to recapture them!
Let's see how this witch sings now!
Flip the hut!
Yes, calm down!
Walled up!
Remove the spell from my turtledove.
Hold on.
Wan!
Vasilisa!
Vasilisa.
Please.
Not-e-et!
Wan!
This is all sorcery. I don't...
Svetozar!
Don't blame yourself, Van. That's all she is.
Don't let yourself...
You cannot kill me.
Sweet Dreams…
Sweet Dreams…
Let him dream about you.
Sweet Dreams…
Sweet Dreams…
Ma!
But you weren't ready.
And would reject me.
Now we are together.
You are not alone.
Do you have a family.
Finally, the world got a worthy ruler.
Son, that's life.
But believe me, everything I did, I did for you.
Darkness has chosen you for great things.
Vanya!
Don't take it! Vania!
Vanya! Let go! Vanya! Vanya!
Please don't take it! Not!
You were hidden in another world.
But I found you. I nurtured your dark side.
But the Light within you began to resist.
Then I realized that I needed to act more decisively.
Now you were ready for anything.
From that moment on, you were where I wanted to be. And did what needed to be done.
By stealing the egg, you doomed the Firebird to eternal suffering.
Only once in her life could she have a child.
But you took it away.
For you to cross the line! Killed!
Done.
Hold on.
That's it!
Eee! Vasilisa!
What are you?
Where is Vanya?
Van, don't resist the Darkness.
Let her in.
Everything has already happened. There is no way back.
Get away from him, witch!
Vanya, what's wrong with you?
The evil in me wins.
I am changing. I'm sorry.
Wan! Vanya!
Wan! Don't give up!
Fight, Vanya!
Vanya!
- Alive! - Yes.
We won't go anywhere without you. It's clear.
And have I been forgotten?
This is only my fault.
this would not have happened.
If we have a time crystal,
so we can go anywhere. Even into the past.
I know where you need to go.
Bubble! Sword!
Oh, you dried vobla!
Dove! Forgive me, fool!
Get up! Get up, bighead.
Get up! Get up!
On!
My berry!
Koschey!
Or like you. Mikula.
O! Where are you from here?
- You can't change the past. - Yah!
And who will stop me?
Are you a gorilla?
I am you.
I have always been with you, since childhood.
You are doomed!
You can't kill me!
I am part of you!
Submit to Darkness.
Therefore, you have no choice.
No, buddy, you don't have a choice.
You can handle the anvil.
I own my own head! Understood?
So tell the Darkness!
Haha!
What? Think you won?
If you stop Kashchei, you will change the future!
Did you think about this?
Never!
You most likely won't be born at all!
Mikul.
She will change you.
And do not plot meanness against Belogor.
Believe me. You are not alone.
You have...
You will have friends.
And you will definitely find your happiness.
Cold.
Mikula!
And this...
So what about darkness?
let's hit you
on buns!
Here we are at home.
Oh you!
Why don't you go home dude?
You will be left without lunch.
Swim, my little fish, swim!
Is the bread fresh?
What a fresh one, try it!
Look! Talking Bread!
Thank you!
Ah, it’s not good for a girl to lift such weights alone.
Get ready, Vanyusha - it will definitely not be boring;
There will be love.
Your love will show up.
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
Or it will melt in the haze, the black forest will get lost,
And you are already on the other side, in the world which does not exist.
Look what the world is around - it's barely waiting;
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
How the heart beats like a surf.
The moon pours in the night, prepares peace for me;
Look what the world is around - it's barely waiting;
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
Aw, aw, aw, aw!
Twenty years ago,
there was an invincible swordsman
He challenged the best of all sects
without a single defeat.
In just a few years,
he became well-known
and had more enemies.
In the end, he fought against all masters at Broken Soul Cliff.
That day,
Wolong was the only one
But after the battle,
No one knew the reason.
Many years later,
the Rakshasa Sect from Western Regions entered Central Mainland.
They searched high and low to hunt Wolong down and kill him.
Our Qingcheng Sect has never interfered in others' affairs.
Just because it was said that Sword Immortal Wolong
had met our Master once before going to live in seclusion,
our whole sect was slaughtered.
Fellow brother Tian,
be patient.
Sixth fellow brother,
Don't do it.
There is no turning back after practicing this Blood-Reversing Manual.
We can go to Longmen Town.
If your Gods and Buddhas are real,
they should cast those Rakshasa beasts to hell.
Where is Longmen Town?
They're
just a bunch of stray dogs in hiding.
Hold your breath.
It's no good, Sixth fellow brother.
Look out!
Before that old man died,
She's Luo Xiaoman, daughter of Luo Yueniang,
the manager of Longmen Town Inn.
Pingan.
call me Boos Wei.
I mean,
Picking-pocket or stealing is fine with us,
but, but hijack?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Get ready to pull the rope.
Here.
And I
happen to have a blade method that can break them.
You should go first.
There's a river thirty miles away by the dead woods.
Bai Wuji.
Luo Xiaoman
Before that,
Pingan.
What to do?
Somebody up there loves me.
We three brothers
grew up hearing that Rakshasa Sect
who maintain a stark sense of good and evil,
and would never...
Trash.
Kill them.
Please spare our lives, sir!
Sir!
Wait.
You are still alive.
Sir,
All right.
You have my permission.
But
Find that woman who has just fled to
By any means possible,
You go alone.
Could I
stay and
let the two of them go?
I said
you go alone.
It's all right.
Boss.
Go.
Seven days.
You have seven days.
Don't forget.
Your brothers
When you find it,
launch the signal flare.
Absolutely.
Come on.
Sit here.
Go.
He Sheng.
Longmen Town, for real?
Of course, it is.
the rules for getting into Longmen?
You are
You spread the news
saying Longmen Town was founded by Sword Immortal Wolong.
I'm afraid the answer is no.
Why?
I'm afraid the dead will stain his eyes.
When you went in,
you kept checking
figure out how to escape, weren't you?
Coming all the way here,
a normal person would have been thirsty.
You have chapped lips
but you didn't drink the tea handed by Cripple.
You must be on your guard.
It's the first time I'm here,
I have no choice but to beware.
You made your point.
I can see that
your right hand is calloused.
You must be
He Sheng
is left-handed.
The last thing you should do
is pretend to be my foster son.
my blood brother,
He Chen.
He has
and
sixteen servants.
Rakshasa dog,
here is your bill.
Cripple, hurry and tidy up.
Don't mess up my floor.
Here we go again.
Lunatic.
Ever since Xiaoman left,
It's been hours,
there's no one here.
You are injured
and poisoned
very badly.
This is for you.
There's some left.
How do you know it's poisonous?
I...
The smell of blood.
The wind is blowing towards me.
Can I
give you a suggestion?
on,
and wait for that hunger to pass.
It will
Yes.
But I can always find a way to get something to eat.
you know, for food.
Right.
That herbal medicine you used
after being beaten too much.
I am Wei Pingan.
It means
A cultural name, isn't it?
What's your name?
Luo Xiaoman.
Well,
I heard that
but they say it's an imaginary land of joy and plenty.
An imaginary land of joy and plenty?
Never mind.
and not get beat up.
Longmen Town Inn,
do
You
Then,
can you take me there, warrior?
I saved your life twice already.
Longmen Town only accepts
Let me tell you this, I grew up with no parents,
I hate to live together
You...
Why do you ignore me?
You...
I don't care.
I...
I...
Sleep.
The good are protected by Heaven.
Eldest Young Master will be safe.
Fifty strokes of the whip
Useless.
Never mind.
I suppose
Forget the rest,
let him
be grounded and ponder upon his faults.
Master absolves you of punishment
and commanded you
I am sorry.
The poison
I sucked out of you yesterday,
completely.
He saved my life.
Ghost Doctor saved his life already.
Longmen has its rules.
I said
he got poisoned because of you, that's why we saved him.
He is just a punk
who doesn't even know martial arts.
Why can't we spare his life?
What if we do that
Will they spare our lives?
Sweetheart,
I don't care.
Fine.
Let's do what we always do, then.
The Judge will decide his life and death.
Wash your face and go downstairs.
Sit properly.
He got jumpy.
Why
when it's already near your mouth?
When was the last time you drink water?
Just now.
Is it interesting?
Let's assume what you are saying is true.
The world knows
our Longmen Town
only kills people from the Rakshasa Sect.
Just now,
why were you so afraid of being found out?
Was I
afraid?
When you look out the door...
I...
Your hands are fair and clean.
If I'm not mistaken,
I'll come clean.
I am
in my dream.
I...
As a matter of course,
my hands are fair and soft, man.
Even if you don't know material arts,
you still have sinister motives.
I, Wu,
don't want to rely on sheer good luck.
Kiddo,
pay your bill, then.
What bill?
Uncle Wu.
Cripple,
Oh.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Well,
then,
you all just talk among yourselves.
Damn.
Don't tell me
they hid it from me?
You two
have to hang in there for me.
No.
I just want to return the favor.
Let him go.
Cover his eyes and let him go.
It's about the secret and safety of Longmen Town.
I don't care.
how on earth could I leave?
I have to think of something.
These are rations and travel expenses.
We're even from now on.
Hey,
can I stay?
Can I
neither go nor die?
No.
No room for discussion?
Yueniang can't show up.
we will make our moves.
Longmen Town
doesn't allow outsiders to come in
and get out alive.
Get on.
Die...
Then I will die.
There's something more important in Longmen Town than my life.
I can't go.
You are
babbling insanely.
Or else
I won't care whether you are dead or alive.
That day, when we were underwater,
although
it was
Luo Xiaoman, I...
I don't care.
Xiaoman.
I finally waited until you came back.
Suit yourself.
Xiaoman.
Xiaoman.
Xiaoman.
Xiaoman.
Luo Yueniang,
Heaven and earth can be the witnesses of what I just said.
I'm definitely not leaving anyway.
Fine.
Fine.
Shengnan,
Yes.
Cripple,
stay here and watch closely.
Remember,
don't go anywhere
until we get back.
Sit here absolutely still.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Kill him.
But Xiaoman
will keep his life for sure.
Get him out of Longmen
and kill him outside.
Then what should we do?
Men's words...
All right.
Old man,
It's dark, we're closed.
Go home and sleep.
You, you, you...
Who let you bother him?
Get back here.
Odd.
From now on, that old man
Don't bother him.
Who, who has told me that?
Huh?
It's been a whole day.
You want to pick on me?
Whatever tricks you have, bring it on.
If you want to learn,
meet me in town two miles north.
Pretending to be a master while wearing those?
This brat
has no intention of leaving.
Be harder on him tomorrow.
That damn man.
He dares to chase the same girl as I do.
Duo.
You, too.
Oops,
I forgot about him.
Damn.
Pretty boy,
your mistake was chasing the same girl as I do.
It's your blessing
to die in my hands.
remember my name.
I am
Swordsman Duoqing.
Old man.
Old man.
Old man.
Old man.
My stuff,
Once your potential is pushed,
your internal force will reduce.
It's not worth it.
Young Master.
We can let him fight Wolong to death...
Check what's on there.
You have no right
to interfere with what I do.
Give it to me.
in Sangcheng.
In fact,
and lead the way to outsiders to go there.
Spread the news
that the Rakshasa is coming.
I can do.
Xue.
Kiddo.
The rest
is on this map.
This old man
has nothing left to teach you.
Old man.
Old man.
Old man.
After waiting for so long, I finally got you.
Are you
talking to me?
When I knew what Xiaoman had suffered,
I was heart-wretched.
To save you,
with a hemp rope,
a wooden plank,
and saved you
Every time I think about it,
my heart aches so much that I can't breathe.
Today,
with your blood.
Thanks.
You saved me, I saved you.
That's all.
The stars overhead.
As long as it's not money.
Stars?
I'll give them to you.
Are you sure those are Wolong's sword skills?
I am, those are Wolong's sword skills.
Or else, I, Duoqing...
A few days ago, that boy didn't know material arts.
After one night,
he made a thoroughgoing change.
If that's the case,
this boy is much appreciated by him.
So what? We can...
Judging from what we saw the other day,
he didn't know material arts.
Xiaoman.
Can I come in?
No.
Tell me,
I told you before.
Just so you know,
I've decided to accept him.
But
there were intimate relations between you two.
If you like him,
I will let him marry you, all right?
I don't like him.
I'm going to bed.
It's all my fault.
I left
Don't.
I've been busy all night.
Let's go.
Where are the stars?
Close your eyes.
Hurry and close your eyes.
Open your eyes.
In all the years I've been here,
I've never had such good food.
Give us a hand.
- Come on, come on. - I think it's good.
Right?
My God, it's not sweet enough.
This is flour.
Put it down.
Why are you petty again?
Pingan.
Come.
Sit here.
Sit down.
Me?
Yeah.
Ruling out the possibility that you're a member of the Rakshasa Sect,
Once you're with us,
we will live and die together.
so we all think of each other
Everyone will treat you like a nephew of theirs.
Why don't you wear
the clothes I gave you?
It's not fit?
It fits.
I haven't worn any new clothes.
Wearing these clothes,
Aren't clothes
Were your clothes
old since the beginning?
The clothes Shengnan gave you
were actually made for her brother.
Shengru,
the descendant of Judge Wu in Guanxi,
had wounded a few members of the Rakshasa Sect because he couldn't stand the sight of injustice,
that Rakshasa Sect took revenge on him.
Shengru was the only one who escaped from the Wu family.
Shengnan watched her brother die tragically.
Here.
for our Longmen Town
having more strength to fight against Rakshasa.
Bottoms up.
Come on, bottoms up.
It's too late.
After all this time,
I finally found someone like you.
After a while,
I thought she was you.
I know.
It's just a new guy coming in.
Show yourself.
Pretty girl.
Your outfit
and weapon.
If I'm not mistaken,
You're that crazy woman,
Mo Luo.
It's Crazy Dog Mo Luo.
I am Duoqing...
I
Have no interest in knowing a dead man's name.
I'll get someone else to drink with me.
Will you?
Finding someone else to drink with?
Cheers.
We could often
hear her sobbing in her room in the town.
for her brother.
Come on, brother.
Sister.
Swordsman Duoqing
with a heartless sword.
Seven days.
We were late.
This is Zhao's niece.
She survived by hiding
in the haystack of the stable.
It's only seven days.
It's not like we are close to each other already.
A piece of clothing and a meal...
Why should I care about their lives?
Their lives are more important, obviously.
Quit waiting.
Your husband sold you out
for a chance to live.
Xiaoman.
Luo Xiaoman.
Go with me, hurry up.
It's so far.
We're running out of Longmen Town.
Where are going?
In brief,
When you fainted the other day,
Do you really like me?
Wei Pingan.
This is probably
the only chance in my life to trust a man.
The dog is coming.
I've had enough of hiding
for years.
We meet again after all.
I've waited
a long time for this day.
I must protect them.
Let them go.
And you can
take my life.
You don't have bargaining counters to talk to me.
You
Haotian,
it was an accident.
she would rush in.
and was trying to talk you out of the final battle.
But you
were out of your mind because of killing.
You sent my son
back to me with false pretenses
Reasons?
because Xue gave birth to Yanzhi.
To torture me,
when I was off my guard,
you stole my son.
Have you ever told Wuji
about my appearance?
At the last moment, to save your life,
you even try to pass the buck to a kid?
Today,
you will
pay your life for Xue.
As for Yanzhi,
were actually made for her brother.
Run.
Take Xiaoman with you.
Hurry.
Hurry and run.
Never, ever coming back.
Run.
Have you found Yanzhi?
Their bodies are also checked.
No snowflake birthmark on the left shoulder was found.
Brat,
you're digging your own grave.
so that you could kill him yourself.
But this sword,
why can't you,
I said
to get involved with my business.
Get lost.
Don't.
Once your potential is pushed,
your internal force will reduce.
It's not worth it.
Brother.
Looking at how painful you are,
Do you know how I've felt all these years?
No,
Our father has two sons,
Your mother died,
and he missed her all his life.
to seek your mother's revenge.
When my mother passed away,
he didn't even shed a tear.
I have pushed you off the cliff.
Why...
when you're gone?
If I can't change anything,
then I don't need to do so.
I need nothing now.
What does "let go" mean?
I can't teach you the last move.
Now,
Aren't you tired, little brother?
None of your business.
Aren't you tired of
living like this?
Although I can't kill you,
A generation of gratitude or resentment ended.
The living
may suffer more.
there are only loneliness and redemption.
This is karma,
Longmen Town Inn.
Waiter,
we two brothers are hunted down by our enemies
Longmen Town Inn founded by Sword Immortal Wolong?
Exactly.
Oh my, Cripple.
Stop sweeping the floor in the morning and help them out.
Xiaoman.
Let's eat!
Stop calling her.
It was joyful when we were together.
It was bitter when we separated.
Bring me another bowl, Cripple.
Xiaoman, let's eat.
Wu, the duster cloth.
Xiaoman, let's eat.
A duster cloth.
Let's have the meal together, Xiaoman.
Come, come, Pingan.
Here, Cripple.
Yueniang.
Your liquor
for today.
Pour some.
Brother Duo.
If Xiaoman doesn't eat, neither do I.
Don't eat, then.
Drink some.
Come on.
All right.
Wu.
All right.
Come on.
Hurry and try braised fish in brown sauce.
the innocence of your smile?
how much you love me.
how to forget
the scenes when I was with you.
If we had never met,
would it be rewritten?
on both sides of the world.
No!
No!
No!

She's so beautiful.
Let me show you this painting.

I guess.
What's the matter, brother Ed?
You don't like me?
This is Carlos, Castanheda.
They are lovers...

They're the best.
Potatoes are so good.
Um... How do you know Idaho?
I was in America
a long time ago.
It was already a very idiotic country.
Puritans in love with guns.
Right?
It's just gorgeous here.
It is.
Time is a whore.
perfidious master.
It blooms tragedy into comedy.
Time eats us.
Like potatoes.
Well, it was so nice to meet you.
running around somewhere,
um, but I'll see you later.
You have very sensual lips.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Trying to write a song.
About what?
It's embarrassing.
Well, come to bed, it's late.
I just heard something really weird.
What?
I think your mom and brother sleep together.
What?
Yeah.
Because I just heard them.
Oh.
That's weird.

I'd prefer if we keep this our little secret.
Okay.
Sure.

No, I promise.
Tomorrow by the latest.
I just have to convince Ed.
Yeah.
I know.
Ryley.
Ryley.
Ryley.
This is good for your anxiety.
This vision that haunts you...
You must fight him, Ed.
You must...
block him from your mind.
Close your eyes, brother Ed.
What?
What the fuck?
It's okay, brother Ed.
It just means you're part of this family.
What?
Close your eyes again.
Or is it Mama?
What are you doing here, Ryley?
We have a gift, brother Ed.
What the fuck?
What the fuck? Stop that.
Fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of my mind! Stop that!
Calm down.
- Stop. - It's okay.
Please stop! What are you doing?
Oh, God!
It's okay.
Okay, brother.
It's okay.
You know I love you, right?
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Baby, I've been thinking.
We should get out of here.
I don't feel comfortable here.
They're really weird.
And if we leave now,
These people are strangers, basically.
Fuck you, Ryley.
Look at me.
I'm done with this.
I'm leaving with or without you.
You better grow up.
- Hey. <i>- Hey.</i>
<i>So, did you talk to him?</i>
<i>Uh, that's annoying.</i>
<i>A witch?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm</i> - He's always wanted a family.
<i>Yeah.</i>
And it's like he's buying into their bullshit.
<i>Can you change your ticket?</i>
<i>so just figure it out.</i>
<i>They're not that expensive.</i>
- I'll call you back, Jay. <i>- What?</i>
<i>Ryley.</i>
Brother.
Brother Ed.
-Brother Ed. -Hmm.
Come see Mommy.
She's dancing.

Hey babe.
- You wanna come dance? - Can we talk?
Come on, we're having fun.
This is really weird.
I don't feel comfortable here.
You're making me want to cry.
You're making me cry.
Why?
I'm sorry.
What the fuck?
No.
We'll walk.

Shit.
Look at this. This is your dad.
It looks like Manuel.
No, but look at the date. It's 30 years ago.
Think about it. They never talk about him.
Wake the fuck up.
These people are psychos.
Don't say that, Ryley.
Oh, my God.
You just broke into someone's house.
All of this. You saw the photos.
I'm sure there's an explanation.
All right?
We gotta go, all right?
Why?
Okay,
What's up?
Hey.
What's going on?
Can you move your car?
-It's blocking the garage. -Mm-mm.
It's parked out front now.
You can take it for a spin if you like.
Yeah, I understand. It's okay.
You should do it.
Go explore.

where they grow in winter,
It has strong vitality.
What happened to the people?
and I'll spare your life.
Kill the witch and hand over the map.
Kill the witch and hand over the intention.
why don't you believe me?
and you,
Everyone,
The Red Dragon is tyrannical,
It's to overthrow tyranny,
His Majesty
Without him,
we would have died in the north.
You used the spiritual power of peach trees to dispel the evil poison for me.
Is it red
Yes. -It can't
one of our suspects has been drugged,
How could this happen?
Are we really poisoned?
Brother Fan,
You know how to use it,
Photo,
These must be a cover-up,
Brothers,
He came back to Demon Realm after telling me about this.
Sima Yan,
The Red Dragon Clan is brutal.
If they get the painting,
even the mortal realm will suffer.
to a safe place.
Saint Girl of Yihang,
It's not easy for you to escape from the coastal forbidden area.
Let's see what I can do to help.
That's great.
But what worries me the most now
Thank you for protecting them for me.
I've found my mortal wife.
I cherish your affection for me.
Don't tell me that.
Well,
Well,
We can attack at any time.
Go to seize the map immediately.
So you didn't want to help them at all.
right?
is a hundred miles away,
No flowers, no leaves,
It's time to change.
assist me to seize disciples.
Then I'll cast spells to guide the way.
guys go first.
His Majesty saved my life.
but Yihang can't watch the demons go to hell.
If Saint Girl lets us cross this bridge,
our debt will be written off.
give you endless wealth and prosperity,
You're just dreaming.
You killed Shengguo.
Today, I want you
to pay with your blood.
Don't leave any of them.
Princess,
Princess Father,
Although I'm from the Red Dragon Clan,
my feelings for you,
I've always been sincere.
The mortals you think,
Even if I die,
You're a good girl.
Yaopeng,
Yaopeng,
What's wrong with me?
It's like a dream.
What's going on?
Liao Peng,
In my lifetime,
I will never let demons get involved in any place.
800 miles of peach trees
are burning with fragrance.
A happy and worry-free life.
I believe there will be more Peach Blossoms in the future.
Or... "creative industries"?
But wait, there's also "entertainment industries"!
Listen.
Right up your alley, right?
who are able to embrace change, stay resilient,
and objectively assess business and technical innovation."
Sounds like the most boring thing ever.
Look.
Your jokes are as bad as your tie.
Stand straight.
I wanted to ask about the rooms.
Can me and Modė somehow get a private room?
I prepared some meat for grilling.
All questions go to Rimas, OK? He booked the spot.
50 euros?
You serious?
What about my kebabs?
You missed them last time, so this time too?
Sorry.
What the fuck?
It's nothing.
What the fuck?
Be the hunters.
Not the prey.
THE FUTURE AWAITS
So, you want everyone to beg you?
Nobody will even notice that I'm not there.
Žygimantas, do us a favor. Make our school famous.
Not only in Lithuania, but around the world.
Good luck!
"Comfortable mattress, fresh air, sandy bitch."
Have you ever seen a lake like that in Lithuania?
You see conspiracies everywhere.
Since they're always hanging out together...
they'll also get their diplomas together.
Good luck, girls.
It's the last chance, Marius. I mean...
We'll never see them again.
<i>BRIGITA...</i>
Brigita either.
<i>EMILIJA RŪDYTĖ</i>
Understand? A low-cut dress won't get you anywhere in life.
Titas! Titas Mataitis!
<i>TITAS!</i>
And finally, I give you...
Rimas Meiliūnas!
Congratulations.
Let's take a picture.
It's no secret that you're expected to be drafted into the NBA...
as the highest pick in Lithuanian history.
After my parents died, I was raised by my grandmother.
But you and Rimas are buddies, right?
What?
He seems like such a down-to-earth guy.
And so here I am today.
What?
- Rimas, what a suit. - Thanks.
- So handsome. - Listen, my first question is...
If he's talking about his meat...
Enjoy it.
Why do you care? You're not even going.
Maybe they've already sent the address?
OK, if you don't trust me, I'll call them right now.
<i>Say cheese!</i>
Why don't you call again?
50 euros!
We won't find anything else, everything is booked.
Smile, people - smile!
Nobody wants to buy it. So what can I do?
Take a look.
<i>It's because of that fire.</i>
<i>I don't know... Maybe</i> <i>we should lower the price.</i>
<i>Vida closed on a place</i> <i>nearby last week.</i>
You know, Marius, your mom and I were thinking about your future.
Have you heard of risk insurance?
<i>So what am I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Wait.</i>
If something happens, you need insurance.
Well...
If your neighbors flood you, you need insurance.
Just think about all the hurricanes, floods and pandemics to come.
Risks everywhere, and you need insurance everywhere.
So I think you need to turn misfortune into fortune.
It's simple, really.
Hello? Yes.
Oh, so you're not going to buy that cottage.
But have you been inside the actual cottage?
Oh, that happened so long ago.
So leave the key under the tree stump.
I'm done. Look.
Don't shout, why are you shouting?
We're sitting here, talking about life. Are you in a hurry?
- Let's enjoy the moment. - OK, let's enjoy it.
Let's enjoy it.
And while we're talking about life, someone...
WHO'S THIS?
STILL UP FOR A PARTY?
Dear students.
Today our destination...
It may frighten some people and give others food for thought.
Careful.
The smarter the person, the bigger the problems.
Yeah...
Looks like it's broken.
I don't know about electricity.
What, you've never been there?
No.
I've never seen this side of you before.
No big deal. Let's just pick a random direction.
I'll restart it, maybe that'll help.
Marius, who owns this cottage?
I don't know. Nobody does now.
This is by Algis Motiejūnas.
and you know who carved it?
Everyone wrote about it.
and then he started carving really strange sculptures.
You're a real fucking expert on some old man’s “wood”, aren't you?
Laima, leave her alone.
Marius did his best and found us a place to party.
I don’t know about you...
but I don't want to party where someone died.
People, let’s get moving.
Not bad.
Too bad it's in Dubai.
Vytas?
Can you help?
- Careful, easy. - Guys?
What's wrong with you today?
Is it something I did?
No, just... Let’s party today and we'll talk later, OK?
Saulė, you'd better put that back.
Guys, come over here.
Wow.
Pretty smoked.
Mhm.
- Really?
Yes.
And what if he...
It's a helmet for you, maybe you'll feel safer now.
Exactly.
OK, there's a lot to do. Darius, go marinate your meat.
Marius?
But...
OK, I'll find it.
Where? To find a cliff for Brigita.
What are you doing?
I'm fucking awesome.
What?
Repeat three times: "I'm fucking awesome." Then go.
I like slim cigarettes, the blue ones.
She says they're gay. So I bite off the tip.
Wow, right?
It's really beautiful.
That's it.
This stage is over.
Can you believe it?
After today, everyone's going to scatter all over the world.
Laima's going to study fashion design in Paris,
And Vytas?
Nice, it suits him.
And you?
I'm still thinking about it.
I know it's annoying when everyone asks.
It's not that bad right now.
Depends on what you compare it with.
Michael Jackson after plastic surgery.
Hitler after his confession.
The toilet after beef stew and a double cheeseburger with onion rings.
The sink after depilation.
What?!
Get out.
Get the fuck out!
300 euros.
300 euros for pissing all over my seats!
Hello! I made it!
They call these Lambos. Super hard to get.
The whole pack, hey...
Žygis, are you fucking insane?
You'll have to get your stomach pumped.
So what? I'm OK.
- Guys? - Marius!
Want some beer?!
- Drink it!
Marius, relax.
Hey hey hey!?
Guys, don't get it on the windows.
Marius relax. It's only champagne.
Chill, it’s a party. People just want to celebrate.
Fuck, don't take pictures, OK?
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Dude, you know what would happen to me if the NBA saw this?
Who's ready to atone for their sins?
Oh, Revelation to DJ John.
May I escort you to your altar?
Marius, we're out of firewood.
Someone has to go look for more in the woods.
We'll go.
Let’s fucking go!
Let’s party!
Me neither.
Give me some, you've been drinking alone all night.
All you have to do is ask.
So tell me about your dark side.
What dark side?
I'm talking about your passion for old folk artists.
So, yeah.
Folk art turns me on.
Folk art and carving.
when they write about all kinds of horrible things?
Like the cannibal girls from Šiauliai.
Weirdly, it’s not my favorite pastime.
You're lying.
Everyone reads it.
Meaning?
What jokes?
So what?
Is it?
What the fuck?
Wow...
These are his works.
His carvings.
There's probably something they shouldn't see.
What is this?
Laima, where are we?
What planet is this?
I don't like it here, let's go somewhere else.
The first time should be memorable, OK?
I've never seen a stranger place, but I like it.
- Let’s get comfy. - OK, guys, sorry.
What the fuck?
Fucking morons.
Let me help you.
Guys!
The forest is full of branches, take this one back.
Rimas, let's take this back.
Relax, dude.
Tonight, there are no rules!
Come on, faster!
<i>Dad, it hurts.</i>
Sorry for the vomit.
Žygis?
What?
Have you thought about where you'll be in 10 years?
Just thinking, that's all.
I'll have a husband.
A wooden one.
Yeah.
Like you never know what he's hiding.
A serial killer?
No. An alcoholic.
Not very original.
Usually he's very sweet, but...
- Beats you? - And how.
He beat me for 10 years.
Maybe she needs help?
I can kill my husband myself.
Sit down.
I'll take care of everything.
OK.
One blow.
That's all it took.
Vytas, it's a sculpture. Let it be.
Fuck.
That's it, give me your phones.
Give me your fucking phones!
Rimas, what are you doing? Calm down.
You should understand best of all. My future depends on it.
You think you're so clever, huh?
You know why?
Because you won't be there!
Shut your fucking mouth!
What are you fucking staring at?
Fucking thank you.
Not too hot?
No - it's bearable.
Lay down.
OK...
What then?
You'll like it.
You'll see.
Come over here.
Did...
Did Rimas do something?
Rimas...
Rimas, Rimas.
No one could give a shit about me because it's all about Rimas.
Be gentle.
Sorry.
Now that's it, huh?
Some kind of fumes...
Hey, why doesn't the door open?
Push it harder.
Help!
<i>Help!</i>
<i>We're choking in here!</i>
Someone help, please!
Fucking help!
It’s full of fumes.
Someone come and help!
Help!
It won't open.
What's going on here?
They're fucking dead.
What happened?
I told them.
Marius...
Hey, calm down.
No one's to blame, OK?
and we'll call the police.
What fucking cottage?
Someone killed them! We have to get out of here - now!
Darius, can you calm down?
It was an accident.
Let's go.
We have to stay together now.
I'm going to get the phones.
What?
This was your revenge.
I was with you all night, you idiot.
OK, OK, everyone needs to chill.
Let's try to think straight.
There are two options here.
And the second is...
What happened?
Modė is out there...
Calm down. Where is he?
There's Modestas and some stranger with a mask, he tried to kill us.
- To kill you? - Yes!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Someone is coming!
Wait!
There's Modestas!
Laima, calm down!
Marius, don’t.
Quiet!
Marius, open the door!
Let me in!
Laima, open the door!
Laima, open the door!
Run, run!
He's coming... He's coming...
Be quiet!
Get away from the window.
Quiet...
Why didn’t you open the door?
Why?!
I thought our graduation party would be better.
Why?
Does anyone have the car keys?
Whose keys are these?
Dude.
One by one.
Quiet!
Calm down, Žygis!
One by one!
Just go. Hurry.
Go!
Stay calm!
Wait, I want to go back!
Fuck, this is a stick shift!
Rimas, drive!
Shut up, Žygis!
Rimas, go! - Be quiet, OK?
Saulė?
Žygis, where are you running?!
Run!
Hey, faggot!
Marius?
Marius! Get over here.
Fuck her, let's get out of here!
This isn't all about you.
Vytas?
I saw him catch Saulė.
What?
No.
We're still alive.
We can try to escape.
Vytas.
Vytas.
Fuck. Vytas.
Angry sir!
Angry sir!
You have serious issues.
I’m here, angry sir!
He's normal for a second, then loses it again.
Karma and justice.
Wait, Saulė didn't even touch the sculptures.
He kills everyone he sees.
It was dark, maybe you confused her for someone else.
Fuck, Vytas.
And then come back and save everyone.
What others? You saw what happened!
OK, so what's your fucking plan?
find the phones and figure out who's still alive.
That's crazy!
We have to leave Žygis somewhere.
We can't leave him, he'll jump on the knife himself.
Fucking heroes.
She's not here.
Let's go.
Look, let's get inside.
She could be anywhere.
Žygis...
Call the cops.
Žygis, please be quiet.
I'm really tired.
Quiet.
Call the cops.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Some man came.
To a cottage somewhere in Kurbiškiai.
I'm not fucking kidding!
Send someone!
He's coming!
Hide!
I AM. IN THE BURNED ROOM
Hello.
Help us!
Run to the boat.
Go!
Guys!
Get in the boat.
He’s beating me.
Žygis? Žygis, come here!
Come here, come here!
Žygis!
Vytas!
And when Rimas was lying there? You didn't have time either?
Get in the boat.
Žygis, come on!
Get in!
Can we switch?
Can you hear me?
I asked you a question.
Can we switch places?
We can.
It's OK.
I just don't understand why he doesn’t touch you...
Like he doesn’t see you.
SAULĖ: IS ANYONE ALIVE I'M IN THE COTTAGE.
Vytas, no.
Vytas, we're not going anywhere!
It really was unforgettable.
A really great guy.
When you get a chance, ask him about Rimas.
Saulė?
So...
What do you think, what comes next for us?
I mean... Was this all a game.. or...
Because I think there’s something real between us.
And maybe you'll laugh, but...
For me...
I like being with you.
I'm serious.
I can't believe this.
What?
Marius, I was just sad.
That's all.
You don't like being with me?
You don't feel safe with me?
Safe?
Our whole class was killed, Marius.
But with me...
With me you're safe.
Fine.
You're worse than a loser.
They have dreams, and you don't have anything.
Your charisma is...
You should google it.
Marius, I kissed you so that...
At least one moment...
Get the fuck out.
Get off the boat right now.
Get off the fucking boat.
Where the fuck are you swimming?
This is my direction.
That psycho doesn't touch you because even he finds you boring.
DAD
Are you still partying?
Marius, can you hear me?
I mean...
A Lithuanian on Jordan’s team!
Listen, you tell him that we're really proud...
It's unreal, Marius.
Dumbshit!
Where are you?
Get the fuck over here!
What? You think I'm boring too?
Get the fuck over here!
Is it because I didn't do anything to your sculptures?
Fuck you!
You're not interested in me?
Fuck!
Get the fuck over here!
Get over here!
Calm down.
I can see that Lukutė is burned.
I can see it.
I know.
This boy will be Gedutis now.
If you're good...
you can stay here.
What's that, Lukutė?
Sing a lullaby for Lukutė, she'll love it.
Sing.
Sing!
Algis Motiejūnas is invited to his last dance.
Algis, get over here!
Where's Vytas?
Let's go!
Get off me, motherfucker!
Father, I'm burning!
Help!
Help me!
Hurry up!
It hurts!
<i>Father, everything is burning</i>
<i>It hurts!</i>
Vytas?
I'm really sorry about what happened in the boat.
I mean it.
I told Saulė that you usually throw your friends off boats less often.
No big deal.
You know, Vytas...
Vytas?
Vytas?
Fuck, there's no pulse!
There's no pulse!
Fuck!
Saulė, do something, please! Just do something! Help me!
I think you should've felt most like yourself with those wooden sculptures.
How you closed the door on Modestas.
How you lied to Vytas about me getting caught.
He told me.
I wanted to help him.
And when he was cutting Rimas’s head off?
Did you want to help then too?
And I'm not talking about Brigita...
<i>Really, we're not mad at you.</i>
Relax.
Marius!
Be careful! Are you crazy?
I'm so glad you're OK.
I don't remember anything.
And my nails smell like shit for some reason.
Let's go, let's go.
Hold on, hold on.
Easy, easy. Give him some space.
Probably the most important question.
We know how much you've been through.
You've suffered such loss and horror.
Where does one find strength in a situation like this?
<i>Not just any wish, of course.</i>
Oh, there are the cookies.
I care too much.
The people of Rosas are good.
<i>To have something more for us than this</i>
<i>I never knew I needed room to grow</i>
Forget I asked.
DAHLIA: Wait! Your Majesty...
To harness a star...
She pulled a star from the sky
You know I would never side with a traitor of Rosas.
- Are these ready? - Yep.
Nah, I heard they're hunting in Kurihara.
Pretty far then.
Go pick some. I'll carry the water.
I remembered I'm late to pick up my kid.
No worries. See you at seven tonight!
Takumi, you're so forgetful!
Sorry I'm late.
The car's coming.
Where's your bag, Hana?
Mountain cherry.
There's a big one there.
Don't touch it. It's Siberian ginseng.
It has thorns.
Even deer don't eat its berries.
Well, they're a bit too hard for people.
You're not into that.
See them here and there?
Look, deer tracks.
Wounded by a bullet.
It's their watering hole.
It's in two days? So soon.
They want a small audience.
How were they?
The lady who came to me seemed nice.
The company's actually a talent agency.
So it's for company retreats?
I think this company's after pandemic subsidies.
Nowadays, you get paid just for submitting a project plan.
Well, let's hear them out first.
It's just a formality though.
Don't get into needless fights, Tatsu.
We're adding it to our seasonal dish.
- I'll try it soon. - Please do.
- Mr. Suruga. - Yeah?
Quills are used for instruments.
What kind of instrument is that?
Like a piano.
You see the shaft here?
You pluck the strings with this to make sounds.
No, not me.
Thanks for this, Takumi.
My son will love this.
- See you. - Good night.
Thank you for joining us on such short notice.
We plan to operate a glamping site here. It's set to begin construction in May.
Thank you for coming.
Thanks for your cooperation.
<i>Glamping in Harasawa</i>
<i>Some of you may be unfamiliar with the word "glamping."</i>
That's all from us.
Now for your questions and opinions.
Please pass this on.
The site can handle up to 64 people. Why's the septic tank capacity for 50?
We think it's adequate.
But numbers will vary by season.
Then that should be the benchmark.
"Optimize"? That's just for your own benefit.
Yes, please go ahead.
Can you show us the septic tank blueprint again?
If you drain from that spot,
You can't put the tank there.
We spoke to authorities.
We were given some limitations on drainage locations.
Wells connect to groundwater.
It's the water supply for us and communities downstream.
Or build a reservoir on-site.
One moment.
That's not for you to decide.
Go ahead.
It will rob me of my purpose for being here.
But I'm not here to talk about myself.
They look so proud and happy.
Your valuable input will be considered.
Our company president. He has the last word.
But you're a talent agency.
So what do you know?
Why isn't your consultant here then?
Our schedules didn't match up.
It's like talking to a wall.
It will become a new tourist hotspot.
Maybe the visitors will stop by your udon restaurant.
More people means better business.
It'll invigorate this region.
Let's think about that.
Your glamping site is basically a camping-themed hotel, right?
Well, we can't keep track of each guest's actions.
You just said you can't keep track of each guest.
There won't be a caretaker on site from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., you said?
- I don't know about that... - I do.
I was a caretaker myself so I know how these things work.
But someone needs to be there around the clock.
They could become more frequent once your glamping site arrives.
we'll oppose the plans.
When does construction start?
It's scheduled for May, but could be delayed a month.
That's why you're rushing.
This briefing is just to make you look good on paper.
You're throwing us under the bus just to make a quick buck.
Now you know the problems.
And we know that it's no use talking to you.
Bring your boss and the consultant next time.
We'll help if the plan is good.
My grandparents were settlers.
It doesn't have a long history.
In a way, all of us here are outsiders.
Balance is key.
If you go overboard, you upset the balance.
We hope to arrange another briefing session.
We now realize how ignorant we were.
We would like to learn more, if you have time.
It all boils down to what Takumi said earlier.
I'm not even talking about conservation.
That's our duty.
We need you to understand that.
Then we can talk again.
Go tell your boss!
Yes, you have a question?
Yeah, you like it?
I do indeed.
- In the field. - I see.
You should get Takumi's number.
He can help out if you ask him properly.
Do ask properly, though.
Until next time.
Call me if you need anything.
Thank you for your time today.
Want some more?
It's yummy.
Have a bite.
This project is full of holes.
<i>Of course it's not perfect.</i>
<i>We'll make changes as we proceed.</i>
<i>Well, I don't think that will change their minds.</i>
How can you say that?
<i>One is to show authorities that you are communicating with the locals.</i>
<i>The other is giving locals a chance to let out steam.</i>
They were steamrolling us!
<i>One demand you can meet is 24-hour supervision.</i>
<i>A little pollution won't affect the water.</i>
The locals are not as stupid as you think, Mr. Horiguchi.
<i>I never called them stupid.</i>
We need to rethink this plan from scratch.
<i>What do you think, Mr. Hasegawa?</i>
It amounts to two months' sales.
It goes into your paychecks too!
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>
We just bought the land.
There's no turning back.
Mr. Horiguchi?
- <i>I have an idea.</i> - Yeah?
<i>He's influential, knows the area, and probably has time to spare.</i>
Sorry for keeping you.
<i>Let's move forward with this idea.</i>
OK, thank you.
<i>Thanks. Talk to you soon.</i>
Bring the guy booze.
We can't have any delays and can't afford any more expenses.
No time like the present!
He shared a location. He'll be there till 1 p.m.
- Then why do this? - Do what?
I loved show business.
I bet it's not what you expected.
No, it's full of scumbags, just as I expected.
Ouch, that's harsh.
My soul.
Then you shouldn't be in this industry.
Yep, I was even on some of his shows.
Wow, you used to act?
I was already burned out by then,
so it didn't affect me.
I wanna smack them.
But chances come to those who don't chase them.
It's so strange and unfair.
So you should just quit.
Zip it, kid.
Hey, I'm not that type of guy. I can be sweet!
What else would it be?
No way. I travel too much for work.
Maybe I'll get married and quit this job.
I should find a wife and move to the countryside.
Hope it works out.
Maybe the campsite caretaker should be me.
- Why not. - I'll get a dog too.
Yeah, come visit!
What a great plan!
No big deal.
No, not yet.
Alright.
We can wait.
Can I try that?
Put your strong foot forward.
That felt great!
- For table three. - OK.
I'm not a loafer.
And I don't need the money.
Let me share something personal with you.
See, I'm a talent agent. That's my main role.
But I want to do something different.
I was thinking of changing my career.
That's why I want to learn more about this area.
Maybe you could start off by becoming my advisor.
It's on a deer trail.
Your glamping site.
They can jump over two meters.
You need a three-meter fence.
That's got nothing to do with taste.
Thanks for coming!
Got enough water?
I'll go get some now.
I have helpers.
I'll stay here a bit.
I'll do it.
They're hunting deer.
It's my first time hearing gunshots.
They see people a lot.
The deer here don't attack.
You're sure?
It might fight back if it can't run.
Wild deer are timid. They avoid people.
It'll be a chance for city people to interact with wild animals.
Touching them is risky.
They carry diseases.
So they won't get touched.
Where would they go?
Call out if you're here, Hana!
Where could she be?
Too many places.
Maybe she went home.
That's deep.
Sorry to trouble you.
No, it's my fault.
Of course.
Make yourself at home. There's food.
I'll come with you!
<i>This is a public announcement.</i>

<i>I repeat.</i>
<i>This is a public announcement.</i>
<i>A child has been reported missing.</i>
<i>She was last seen wearing a blue jacket...</i>
Hana!
Come here!
Hana!
<i>A child has been reported missing...</i>
What are you doing?!
Welcome back.
If it continues like this...
It's okay, it's nothing.
Should I answer now?
with my family.
Since then, it's been almost eight years.
It's this painting.
Um... Waseda Shochiku,
Why?
and I can go anywhere.

We're about to graduate too.
he won't call back, right?
Don't think what I'm doing is easy.
{\an8}My sister, 15,
{\an8}trying so hard to look perfect.
{\an8}And my dad on his computer.
{\an8}He always says it's work,
happy and sweet.
{\an8}- You ready to go?
{\an8}- Almost.
{\an8}- Okay.
{\an8}My family can't even see me.
{\an8}- But my cookies aren't done yet.
{\an8}- Come on, Violet, hurry up.
Sometimes I think I'm a witch.
As for that spell,
I said it wasn't easy.
And now, I've ruined everything.
- Watch what you wish for.
Should I pull over?
No, no, no, keep going.
Said one lemming to another.
Huh.
- Quit it.
- Violet.
- Wait, wh-which right?
Hello? Any clues?
- Typical.
Uh, miss, uh, miss...
I guess that's her, right?
- Yeah.
- Everything is ready for you.
Oh, Adam!
Good.
- Savannah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be a model too.
but now Yana is all about business.
And Yana's business today
So let's go, people! Let's move!
- Stop.
This one's pretty special.
- Ciao.
- There's no cows here.
- No?
- That's mean.
- Feel the light, feel the beautiful light.
- Que bello.
I, I'm Daniele.
- Violet.
- You not one of them?
No, are you?
Eww, no.
Where is my package? Get inside now.
What?
- Why Savannah?
- Trust me, she'll bring me
I know what look I need, and I know...
- Brava, Savannah.
Congratulations. - Uh.
- This is Franco.
Thank you, it's all so unexpected.
Violet.
Look at this contract, would you?
- Sure.
for you, right?
Uh, no.
Thank you.
I mean, a little slutty.
For the last time, no!
to start making decisions like that.
You on the other hand
aren't quite there yet.
like Franco to use your body
That's what photographers do.
what photographers do.
to make sure he doesn't.
- Oh, right.
- What?
- Listen, honey, we,
we don't ever wanna stop you
living the life you wanna live,
but everything has a season.
- There's things out there.
- Out where?
to, to, to stay safe.
"Get in my car, little girl.
I'll give you some candy"?
- Then what?
a really big one.
Giant plug?
- What if I open it?
Well, the, the whole world will get sucked down
or
bad things could come up.
- Like what?
What bad things?
yet, okay?
Come here.
Love you, mm. Now, get outta here.
- You could destroy us, you understand?
Now look at me.
Feel your power!
Now, okay, okay. You are a spider.
- Eww.
And you eat your boyfriends for lunch.
That's great, perfect.
Hold that!
Okay, show me how you devour your prey.
That's good.
One foot forward.
Now lean towards me.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, you want a gelato?
- No, thanks. This is boring.
Promise, Violet.
- Fine, okay. I promise.
that's incredible.
- Okay, alright.
- Ciao.
- I'm running away.
- Out there.
- There? There is only forest.
- Sounds good to me.
- Yeah, right.
My farm was there. I know.
- I'd rather take my chances.
- Be careful.
Kill me, kill me with your eyes.
That's it.
Now, give him more anger.
More anger, I wanna see more anger.
That's it. No, that's too much anger.
Too much anger.
Yeah, that's it.
- Where's Violet?
Look at me.
in this scary old village
with no big strong man to protect her.
- Yeah, well, you never know what's out there.
Not so sweet.
- Daniele!
Daniele!
Daniele.
- Get off the scooter.
- Look.
- For me.
- Yana.
- Daniele, do what he says.
- Okay.
- Get off the scooter!
Savannah.
- Mother.
You gave me this gift.
The flowers that love me.
Speak to me.
Why me?
Will you teach me?
I will listen to you. I promise.
Oh, that's good.
Now, move the hair out of your eye.
A little more.
Okay, head back more.
Nice, nice.
- Hey, Savannah! Hold, Savannah!
- Savannah!
- Daniele!
- Hello.
The witch or a witch?
- A boy told me a witch lives here.
- Violet.
- Well, Violet, if you believe everything
Oh, meet Delilah.
Wanna see my garden?
- Okay.
Wow.
- Ahh, ahh, ah, no, no.
Naked Ladies, very dangerous.
- Dangerous?
- Poison.
- And that one?
- Oh, Angel's Trumpet, extremely deadly.
- Is everything here poisonous?
- Not everything.
They won't hurt me.
- Wow, nice.
Oh, come on, she's too young.
Well, look who's up.
- What happened?
- Oh.
You hungry?
- I guess.
Are these poisonous too?
- You're interested in flowers?
- They aren't for anything.
They're just flowers.
- They're actually sexual organs.
- Eww.
It's just true.
Well, except for those.
What you think are their flowers
are actually their stomachs.
- Plants don't have stomachs.
- They're carnivorous.
Now, what's that about?
with my sister.
- And you wish they'd be busy with you?
like they see your sister?
- Oh, power is always fun.
It's just not always safe.
You sound like my dad.
He said, "It was like a giant plug."
- It?
without getting embarrassed.
- Well, go and see.
- No way.
Open it, open it.
- Who said that?
A friend, a friend.
I'm only trying to help.
Peek underneath. You'll laugh when you see.
- When I see what?
Go on, pull!
Harder!
- Whoa.
- Hello.
- Who are you?
- If you're not me, then who are you?
- No, I'm looking down.
Can you find a rock?
- What for?
Can you?
- Like this?
- But you're down.
- I told you, I'm up, you're down.
what it's like or not?
- Just throw the stupid rock.
Awesome.
- I don't feel any different.
- You will, here, catch.
Better now?
- What happened?
- We switched.
What? Okay.
That was pretty cool,
but let's switch back, please.
- Not now, tomorrow morning at sunrise.
But if you're late, you'll be stuck up there.
And I'll be stuck down here forever.
- What? Wait.
- Sunrise, promise?
- Okay, okay, fine, I promise.
to make it all work, goodbye.
- Wait. No!
Stop! Please don't!
Stop! No!
No! I changed my mind!
- Welcome.
Welcome.
- You smell like one.
Play time's over.
Good luck.
- There's a huge creature thing
- No, no, no.
It can't possibly have an appetite yet.
- Of what? Looks the same.
- No, yes.
But.
Oh my God.
Do I still have parents on this side?
And everyone else.
- Well, let's find you something warm to wear.
You look gorgeous.
Well, you already are.
Ooh, try one of these.
They are delicious.
- Right, you know those people
So
I want you to try some of this drink.
On this side, you know better.
does that change things
could change the events of yesterday.
because if you don't, you're gonna be stuck on this side
with all the choices you've made forever.
So, drink up.
Not 'til tomorrow morning.
- Oh.
But you gotta be careful, you know,
those woods are very dangerous.
You, you can always just
stay here with me, right?
try some of this lemonade
my grandmother made.
Oh, well, choose the right path.
and I'm feeling rather peckish.
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Neutral ground?
Follow the red ribbon.
- You know the rules.
- Paradiso is yours, Inferno is mine.
- She's not yours.
Her parents too.
- And this key.
It must now pass to me.
- It's not a trinket, Sister.
It's what makes the flowers bloom.
You burned yours.
There's nothing left in you to bloom.
And yes, the key must pass,
whom you've brought to me.
I wonder.
pass it on to that little brat.
little mitts all over it.
- And you would?
Oh, name your price.
- You could never pay it.
It has to be given freely, remember?
Go ahead, see what happens.
♪ And you wiped my tears away ♪
It will be fun.
- Pardon.
Hey.
- Ciao, bella.
Huh.
you just have to tag along.
- Do not!
This other side, this!
- Yeah, right.
Did she give you that padded bra too?
- Ah, I just saw something awful!
Hey, what'd you see?
- Dad, with his arm around Yana.
- That's all?
- That's all?
It's just
everything in this world is so wrong.
This isn't our real life.
- No! But there's a way back.
I jumped through it.
- That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
- Just listen to me.
- Why? I'm having fun here.
And don't you dare tell Mom.
- Girls.
without permission, on a motorcycle.
- Mom, nothing even happened.
Where'd you get that outfit?
- What?
- Oh, forget it.
We shouldn't be late.
- Wow. My girls look beautiful tonight.
- Uh.
- Oh, these are beautiful.
- Whoa.
What?
When were these taken?
- Dad.
- Those were taken today, you were there.
- I, I certainly wasn't.
You were reading your book.
I must've been on the phone.
something about, uh, your job.
- Where's Daniele?
- Ugh, probably hiding from us.
Knowing that boy.
- He hates working for you.
- Violet, mind your own business.
Why would anyone hide from you?
- This one, Violeta.
So unique.
Of course, it all comes from you.
- Great idea, get some rest for the party.
- But I can still go, right?
So they need to go to bed
and think about that, hmm.
Alright, go ahead, honey.
- Mom.
- That's, that's very kind, but umm...
Well, we've decided that-
- Savannah, end of discussion.
Shut up.
Dad is not gonna know unless you tell.
Because I'm the guest of honor, Violet.
- Next time you see me,
- Who cares? Everybody there will be horrible.
- Maybe you're right.
Franco's kind of a creep.
He looks at me like ugh.
and he can't see she's just playing him.
- Says the girl that's being played by Yana.
I could smell him.
- Eww.
but it was good.
There are people, like, everywhere.
- So you didn't kiss?
- Not yet.
- Savannah.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
I can't believe this.
How could you let this happen?
up to make pornography.
Where were you?
but somehow that never happened.
No.
- Oh.
She's already asleep.
I guess Yana's my fault too.
You wanna be with Yana!
- Alright, listen to me.
- Don't touch me!
This conversation is over!
Fine by me!
Violet.
Okay, with...
Without Franco, Yana sees nothing.
And don't forget, be nice to Franco.
- Savannah!
- No, you're not.
- That's all you really care about, isn't it?
- Are you?
He thinks you're a stupid cow.
- Who? Who thinks I'm a stupid cow?
- First thing when he saw you at the audition.
- You know, just because you
suddenly grew a pair of junior boobs
Daniele likes me, and we're gonna kiss.
so he can brag about it!
- Ugh!
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
- Who, Savannah? No.
- What for?
What do you wait for?
- Sunrise.
- You're lucky, tomorrow you go home.
Never have to see Franco or Yana again.
- I'd like to see you again.
For you. For when you go away.
Wow!
She's a lying little hypocrite.
But she was right about you.
trying to make out with girls
so you could brag about it.
- Violet!
Violet.
What's wrong?
- Mom?
- Oh, oh no, Violet! Wait!
Wait, stop!
Violet!
- Don't mess with Franco!
- No! Bastardo!
Jerry, ah.
Ciao.
Franco knew you would never stay away.
- Oh, but-
- Uh.
- You're early.
- Go on! Do it!
- Do what?
- Why?
Because your parents turned out to be merely human?
- Oh, so you're giving up?
where everything else isn't so crap.
- Huh? I thought you were braver than that.
- Brave? Nobody on this side is brave.
Everybody here is weak,
and mean, and selfish.
any of them.
- What if they were all the same on both sides?
What if it was you
who wasn't seeing them before?
- No. No!
- Yes, sucker.
Guest of honor's here.
- No, she was beautiful before.
- Violet! Violet, please.
- Uh.
Become a member of our family.
Do you accept?
- Yes.
Now let's show ourselves to the world.
Go on.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to welcome all of you extraordinary people.
You are the first to experience the Paradiso collection.
And now, I give you the incomparable Yana.
and beautiful lives.
my beautiful birds of paradise
and my new collection?
- Violeta.
Violeta! Violeta!
Violeta.
Are you okay? What happened?
Just trust me.
Just, please. Just trust me.
Just trust me.
Okay.
- Wait, wait, what happened?
Have you seen Savannah?
- Don't you worry. We're family.
- Yeah.
Where is Savannah?
- Where?
Time to decide, Savannah.
Are you ready?
Ready to take your career to the next level?
- She's ready. I can tell.
- Savannah? Savannah?
Violeta.
You took your time,
I mean, Mamma mia.
We'll get her something much better, I promise.
Not you.
She's one of us.
- But hey, you're always welcome to join.
- Savannah, I'm taking you home now.
It's okay. It's okay.
- No, they're not.
Now clear out!
- Oh God.
- Love you.
- What? Savannah?
What the hell
- Franco, forget the camera.
Stop!
- Now you're dead!
Franco!
Oh God.
Come on.
- Savannah!
Hey!
Savannah.
- Daniele!
Daniele, Daniele.
- Daniele.
- Please, this is crazy.
Why is she so special?
- She has my key.
- Your what?
- Let's go, move!
Stab it! Kill it!
- No, do it. Now.
- Look, final warning.
This is your problem.
Not mine! - Franco.
Franco, get back here now!
I hate you.
Which is why you can never have the key.
- To that little brat?
I'll just destroy her.
And my Inferno will live forever.
- Live forever? You're already dead.
No!
You're the one that's dead!
Would you even recognize me?
I wonder.
No, no.
before sunrise tomorrow morning.
- No, no, no, no.
Oh, great.
- Never.
- Fine. New offer.
- What? This?
Fine, take it
if you leave me, Savannah,
- Deal.
I promise.
You silly, silly little girl.
You've just given me the key, which means...
Why?
You.
- Want to try again?
- It's not a toy,
you stupid, stupid little girl.
No, it's mine!
Mother! You're supposed to, stop!
Ah, no!
- Hazel!
Hello?
Hazel! Hazel.
- Hazel.
I'm stuck on the side forever.
Only it's a lot more fun.
Violeta!
Violeta!
- Daniele!
Ciao.
- Ciao.
So you decide to stay?
- Mm-hmm.
Where's Savannah?
- Let's go.
- Savannah? Savannah!
- Violet!
Hello, Violette.
- Hello, sir. - Where's Eugénie?
Is my bath ready?
Just one more pot of hot water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Violette.
Thank you.
Mm.
Eugénie, it's delicious.
Who are you, young lady?
This is Pauline, my niece. I'm looking after her today.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Thank you.
When you're done, you can get the crayfish.
The water's boiling.
Look, we'll add the fish.
Want to help me?
That's good.
Go on.
I'll prepare the quenelles.
Thank you.
The vegetables, Violette.
Thank you.
The rooster comb.
Violette, please strain the butter.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Pauline, come here.
- Smell good? - Yes.
Taste it.
Remember the taste.
You'll compare once it's been clarified.
You recognise this sauce?
No.
Can you name the ingredients?
Smoked bacon.
Red bell peppers.
Mushrooms.
Fennel.
Tomatoes.
Oranges.
Wine.
Parsley. Thyme.
<i>Bay leaf.</i>
Cumin.
Juniper berry.
Clove.
Carry on.
There's also paprika and cognac.
There you go.
A Bourguignotte sauce.
Bravo.
Astonishing girl.
Yes.
Here, Violette.
The wine, please.
Careful.
You dip the ladle.
Then you drizzle...
...the stock over the egg white...
...to filter the scum.
That's how you obtain a nice, clear broth.
Go ahead.
Taste.
Is it different, now that it's clarified?
Yes. It's not as strong.
Before, the flavour was stronger and coarser.
Now it's more subtle.
After all, Rabaz did a good deed today
And you, Beaubois?
Man is the only animal that drinks without thirst.
Wine is the intellectual side of a meal.
Meat and vegetables, the material side.
Worse than hunger is not knowing when you'll eat.
Here's Rabaz.
Excuse me, dear friends, I had to go home and change.
We could barely resist tasting the consommé.
It whet my appetite.
Here.
Oh.
What perfect expression.
Thank you.
Are you unwell, Eugénie?
I'll be fine.
We owe Antonin Carême the <i>vol-au-vent.</i>
Do you believe that story?
We're not historians.
But we like a good story, even if untrue.
What an extraordinary fate.
Since his death, kings have been dethroned,
still stands.
Weeping, he hears his father tell him
for him and his 14 siblings.
even though he never left Paris after that.
Wait, do it slowly.
I'll start over.
Was the <i>vol-au-vent</i> good?
- It's the best thing I ever ate. - Ah.
Finish your food.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Hm.
Clos-Vougeot!
Well done, Rabaz.
Excellent.
Good old Rabaz.
Mm.
Mm! It's fabulous.
I have a nice story about Clos-Vougeot for you.
In 1364, Pope Urban V
wanted to leave Avignon and return to Rome with his Court.
And... Oh, my God.
I agree, Grimaud, all conversation must cease
when a truffled turkey appears.
But this is merely veal loin with braised lettuce.
had no desire to leave Avignon.
They imagined a wretched life far from their Burgundy wines.
Resistance was so great
Upon the death of Urban V,
his successor, Pope Gregory XI,
immediately annulled the threat of excommunication
so that his court might enjoy Clos-Vougeot again.
Mmm.
Violette.
Here.
Always impressive.
Magnificent.
No, not a miracle,
merely a scientific reaction.
- Truly? - The ice cream remains frozen.
I see.
- Oh, yes. - He's the one who created...
- Absolutely. - What's it called again?
Baked Alaska.
OK.
Sort of.
What's it called?
Baked Alaska.
Why Alaska?
Eugénie!
Eugénie!
Thank you.
We miss you in the dining room.
Yes, why don't you ever eat with us?
That's up to Eugénie.
It's simply not possible.
In the kitchen.
I just...
What more can I say?
I...
I inhaled its scent,
I turned it, stroked it every moment it was in this kitchen.
texture and even taste.
Without having taken a bite.
So, this turbot did not give you more than I received.
Now, gentlemen, off to the salon.
Violette will serve liqueurs.
You're an artist. Thank you.
Violette.
They talk nonsense.
They speak the truth.
<i>He</i>...was an artist.
Who is he?
Antonin Carême.
Why are their hats different?
evoked a man getting out of bed.
He slipped a cardboard disc inside.
Oh, well...
- Mr Dodin taught you to cook? - No.
I cooked long before I met him.
Then who taught you?
A famous one too.
But it was mainly my mother.
He wasn't very patient.
They died long ago.
What did you feel at your first bite of Baked Alaska?
- I almost cried. - Why?
Have you ever cried when you ate something?
No.
What do you think happened?
Listen to this.
Auguste Escoffier and a certain César Ritz
are going to open a so-called "palace" in Monte Carlo.
The first hotel of its kind
We live with the legacy of Carême.
Merely 13 years
separate Antonin Carême's death and the birth of Escoffier.
Gentlemen.
Sir.
There are five men in this room.
I wish to address Mr Dodin,
Yes.
Please, carry on.
Forgive me.
As I was saying,
He'll never accept.
Please tell...
...His Highness...
...that I accept his invitation.
Thank him warmly.
These four gentlemen are my suite.
I thank you in the name of the prince.
Gentlemen, I wish you a pleasant evening.
The Napoleon...
We were certain you'd refuse.
Mm.
I couldn't refuse.
Several days ago, I was begged to accept it.
When she tasted the Baked Alaska,
I thought she would cry.
One can have perfect pitch at age three,
Hm?
I see it's important to you.
And not to you?
Apparently less than for you.
Tomorrow, I'll take Pauline home and talk to her parents.
Hm.
Thank you.
As you like.
...brings more joy to humanity than the discovery of a new star.
Eugénie.
Since when do you ask beforehand?
Knock.
You'll see if it's open or not.
If I ask, it's to ensure it's not locked.
You'll see.
I ask you once again.
- Marry me. - Mm!
We study texts and recipes, make them and eat them.
And your wit makes me laugh.
So, tell me...
Mm.
There is much witticism against marriage.
You might like this one.
"Marriage is a dinner that begins with dessert."
Ah!
How dreadful.
The first couple, Adam and Eve, started with dessert.
Mm.
It's true, everything started with something they ate.
Sure.
Friday you have your weekly meeting with your banker.
As your notary, I'll take the opportunity to give him
several deeds to put in his safe.
Very well.
For the calves, I'll tell Antonin. He'll meet you in the pen.
Unless something comes up, I'll be there too.
Ah!
Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello. - Hello.
- You OK? - Yes.
Hello. Hello.
Only six?
Ortolans. Eugénie buys them at the market.
But they're never as good as here.
Augustin gorges them with millet seed
He plucks them without gutting them. And <i>voilà.</i>
They're almost done.
With your permission, I'd like to train Pauline.
- Exceptional. - It's a great honour.
Pauline told me about your vegetable patch.
- Come! - What's that?
A copper antenna crowned with zinc.
Oh.
They're placed 20 feet apart.
Very surprising.
What are they for?
It makes the plants healthier and more robust,
and our crop is better.
- Really? - Yes.
The difference was striking.
Ah...
Thank you.
Thank you, Augustin.
Thank you.
- Mm. - Ooh.
- Oh. - Ooh.
- Augustin. - Thank you.
- Thank you and to the next round. - I'll get started.
Have you seen Eugénie?
Yes.
I heard you come in.
But...
How were the ortolans?
It's nothing.
What about Pauline's parents?
It went well.
They agreed to her apprenticeship?
No. Um...
They didn't agree or disagree.
- They want to think. - Oh.
Eugénie, I'm worried.
No, he'd be wasting his time.
Master, with no pretentiousness intended,
Hearing a menu is always a pleasure.
Please read.
The menu is comprised of three services.
For the centre dish, a yearling boar
with summer truffles.
Hors d'oeuvres:
spitted partridges with herbs and essence of ham,
<i>poupetin </i>of turtledoves, and stuffed pike.
The main entrées:
two stuffed chickens in cream and young rabbits <i>à la Saingaraz.</i>
After the soup: dry sherry.
For the white wine:
Carbonnieux, Langon, Meursault and Pouilly.
For the red: Chainette, Thorins and Saint Estèphe.
Cyprus Malvoisie and Madeira will be served.
The second course will have two entrées
before the four roast dishes:
and torrent trout <i>à la chartreuse</i>.
ribs of beef hollandaise,
with sweetbreads in similar fashion
and quenelles from the same cut.
There will be three sauces:
<i>piquante</i>, poor man's sauce and sky blue.
And three salads: herbs, oranges and olives.
The prince's generosity turned into an ordeal.
The prince believes that a gourmet should fear no menu,
I thought my stomach would fail me.
But my discomfort ended
and I surprisingly carried through to the end.
What did Dodin think?
In short, Dodin saw the prince's meal
Abundant and rich, but no light or clarity.
No air, no logic, no line.
Custom, but no rules. A parade, but no organisation.
of flavours and textures.
The almond pastries,
which demand such attention, were served after the ices,
which paralyse and lull the senses,
and before the cheeses,
also iced.
More precisely, he said:
That was it.
The wines.
Though their order was not.
The cigars.
The ratafias and the <i>eaux-de-vie</i> too.
Mm.
turkey breast in wine jelly and a fricassee of asparagus tips.
and he went to bed.
He's studying.
A menu.
- To invite the prince? - Yes.
Would you?
Yes, of course.
Help yourself.
Hello, Augustin.
Hello, Eugénie.
- A pot-au-feu? - Yes.
He will serve the prince boiled beef and vegetables.
That's it.
One selects a cut of fresh beef,
The meat is not rinsed, to keep its juices.
After removing the bones,
then placed in a pot with one pint of water per pound of meat.
Incomprehensible.
Eugénie?
Eugénie?
My friends!
No.
Rabaz!
Eugénie, what's wrong?
I fell asleep.
- Don't move. Don't move. - Huh?
What's wrong?
- What happened? - I'm fine.
- Fell asleep? - Yes.
Oh. Everyone's here.
Yes, come with us.
Careful.
I'll help you.
Lean on me.
Nothing serious.
I'll bring you some medication later.
You need rest.
Be reasonable and stay in bed.
and I'm a friend.
Trust me, would you?
OK.
Thank you.
Get some rest.
I'll walk the good doctor out and be right back.
Your broth is delicious.
Any time you like.
It's my pleasure.
You have better things to do. Violette can cook for me.
Violette.
Mm.
She can barely boil water.
...serious.
Even grave.
- Do I? - Mm.
The wit I love so much is gone.
What's wrong?
When I...
When I found you in the garden...
...I thought...
...die myself.
I feel full of life.
I'm so happy.
And grateful.
unless it's against the good doctor's recommendations.
Of course.
Of course.
You can send an invitation to the prince whenever you like.
I'm well and ready.
Unless you aren't?
Uh...
I have a better idea.
Violette.
Thank you.
Remember...
...last year, I purchased three bottles in a London auction.
An 1837 Krug Clos d'Ambonnay champagne.
when the boat transporting 2,000 bottles to America was shipwrecked.
Everything is still here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May I watch you eat?
If you want.
An 11th century Chinese poet
obeyed one rule his entire life.
He worked one year,
then devoted the entire next year to his wife.
I should have followed his example.
For example, you're neither a poet nor Chinese.
I'm not a poet.
The Napoleon of gastronomy,
And many other names, but not poet.
Let's say... not yet.
And there was the word "wife."
I'm working on that.
I'll be back.
The teeth...
Yes, the teeth...
...break up the food.
Next, the glands of all species...
...moisten it inside the mouth.
The tongue mixes the food by moving it around...
...then presses it against the palate...
...to release the juices
and savour the flavour.
It rises in the middle,
forming a slope at its base,
It transports the food to the oesophagus,
But with you, Eugénie,
this activity...
...is absolutely beautiful.
Wonderful.
Yes, sir.
You can go now.
Careful, the plate must be facing a certain way.
Yes, I know.
Friends!
Dear friends!
Eugénie and I
have decided to wed in our autumn years.
Not autumn!
Reassure me, you know nothing of autumn, Pauline?
It's also a fine season for gastronomy.
Aw.
In autumn,
the grape harvests bring cool winds, game and good cheer.
And though quails, warblers and corncrakes depart,
the woodpigeon, woodcock and duck arrive...
...from the other end of the world to whet our appetite.
caused by the summer heat.
In Normandy, apples are harvested with sticks
to embellish and vary our sweet courses.
In autumn, one dines by candlelight,
That's true!
Ducks and wild geese travel from North to South.
Autumn is the transition from the frugal joys of summer
to the solid pleasures of winter.
Eugénie, let us wed in autumn...
Bravo!
Bravo!
The guests were pleased, I think.
We are fortunate to have such enjoyable friends.
I love summer.
Don't you?
But the summer sun...
I love the burning sensation.
I need that sensation
inside my body.
I understand.
Come in.
This is now your room too.
So...
Here we go.
Dainties before the soup.
Eugénie Chatagne's soup.
Mm.
Brillat-Savarin's fritters.
Dodin's pot-au-feu.
Soubise purée.
Dessert.
There.
- And that's all? - Yes.
Mm...
It's...
"hazardous"
and "audacious."
And...
...there's the pot-au-feu.
I know what you think.
These three vulgar words are inglorious and scented with grease.
But boiled beef and vegetables
is so French.
Thus, I take up the challenge
to marvel the prince with my own personal pot-au-feu.
With your help, of course.
Thank you.
Hm.
It doesn't frighten me.
And you?
Do you sense me wavering?
- Yes. - Why would I be afraid?
Eugénie?
Eugénie?
What's wrong? Violette!
You agree, dear colleague,
Come now, this is absurd.
You're not here to define medicine!
Yet, it's useful.
It explains why we don't know certain things
So, you don't know what's wrong with Eugénie? You know nothing!
We don't know if it's serious or not,
or how it might evolve.
Let's hope so.
Yes, let's hope.
Only hours ago, you fainted in my arms.
I'm sorry I scared you.
But... only an hour later, I felt fine.
Thank you for coming all this way
to give our friend Dr Rabaz a second opinion.
The two of you agree I'm perfectly well.
you'd find a healthy woman.
Thank you.
I know I was unreasonably anxious.
Right now...
...I'm reassured that you're well.
Some of my nights you know,
But the other nights...
More than anything.
are numerous.
Far too numerous.
There are also many nights when...
walking from your room to mine.
- Noiselessly. - My heart pounding each time.
Something extraordinary happened twice.
I imagined you quietly coming out of your room.
turn right and go down the hallway.
Twice.
Only twice... during all these years,
the very moment I imagined you opening my door...
...it really opened.
Violette?
Violette.
It's Eugénie.
Can you go see?
You don't want to eat?
I can make you something simple.
Thank you, I'm fine.
You haven't eaten in two days. It's not reasonable.
I don't need you anymore.
I dreamt I was humanity's first cook.
Or the first male cook?
I told Eugénie my dream, like I told you.
But I realise now...
Eugénie needed exceptional intuition
and a perfect understanding of the man you are.
Let's give Dodin our suggestions.
We'll see.
Yes.
We can't just do nothing.
I have faith in this list of cooks.
Does Dodin have faith?
...Eugénie was a very beautiful woman.
- Hm. - Hm.
who will talk to Dodin?
Not me, in any case.
I might have an idea.
We know what Dodin eats for breakfast.
Eugénie?
What's that?
What's going on?
Violette?
Who are you?
Who said you could wear that apron?
Sir.
Take it off!
Go.
Go!
Go, I said!
Why did you...?
We apologise.
Speak of it no more.
We've drawn up a list of cooks.
No!
Sir.
Gentlemen.
Ma'am. Sir.
Forgive us for coming unannounced.
No harm done, ma'am.
How is Pauline?
She's very unhappy.
Ever since Eugénie's death...
Without a qualified cook...
...it would be impossible.
We understand and we've explained the situation, but...
Very well, we understand.
Thank you for hearing us out.
Pauline...
Despite her young age,
Forgive me for asking you this...
Of course.
I'll speak to her.
Thank you.
Mr Dodin.
Here is a list of candidates...
...that we drew up together.
and cut the fillets into equal-sized pieces.
Trim them.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet.
Sprinkle the fillets with salt.
Baste them with a bit of melted butter.
When it's time, put them on the stove.
Pour <i>maître d'hôtel</i> sauce over the fillets
to which you have added reduced <i>velouté</i>
and extra lemon.
Very well, sir.
Thank you, miss, you may leave.
Very well, sir.
Here, taste.
Thank you.
Perfectly cooked.
- Your veal <i>fricandeau</i>. - Thank you.
This very complex soup
has singular old-fashioned charm.
It must have one flavour,
but each part of this flavour
Broadly speaking, it should be reminiscent of a sonata's development,
where each theme retains its own life and individual flavour
within the blended power and harmony of the whole.
Here's the recipe. Please read it carefully.
Yes, of course. Very well, in fact.
It was named after her.
But if you think I could learn it from you...
...please let me know.
Goodbye, sir.
You can take them off the stove.
Salt and pepper.
I'm coming.
and prevents the aromas from escaping.
When the dough is cooked, the pot is sealed.
and cook it gently over a low flame.
Pauline, wake up.
We're going to make a pot-au-feu.
Pauline, wake up.
Put this on the stove.
That's good.
Help me.
Well? You like it?
No, you don't.
It's normal, you're too young.
Bone marrow...
...is very complex.
It takes culture and a good memory to shape one's taste.
This is what marrow must taste like.
Remember it.
- Yes, sir. - Good.
There.
Skimming spoon.
Thank you.
Just wet your lips.
It's good.
It makes the meat taste even better.
Chambolle Musigny.
It has everything. Class, elegance, pureness.
A long finish.
And an extraordinary bouquet.
The food we made is very good.
But it's like an outline or a sketch.
Twenty years.
We cooked every day.
I read a recipe and she worked magic on the stove.
I miss her.
When she spoke to me...
...I watched her mouth and her eyes as intensely as I listened.
But now...
...it's over.
Forgive me for bursting in.
I'd better come back later.
Grimaud!
Grimaud!
Actually, it can't wait.
Then come in.
I was having lunch at an acquaintance's home.
After a consommé of sturgeon bone marrow...
Dazzling!
This dish appeared.
I quickly came here...
Mm. Sea bream.
Sweetbreads sautéed in butter...
With foie gras?
I'd never paired them together.
Morel mushrooms...
...are the springtime.
The blend of sweetbreads and celeriac is muted, subdued,
not explosive and very enveloping.
The cucumber,
...and the lemon's note of acidity bring freshness to this construction.
With the fish, it's another story.
which retains its natural savour
A fine encounter of earth and sea
that praises the beauty of the land.
Grimaud, this is admirable.
<i>The guests were pleased, I think.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Speak for yourself. I'm in the summer of my life.</i>
<i>I love summer.</i>
<i>the first snowflakes,</i>
<i>the first chimney fires,</i>
<i>the first buds.</i>
<i>But the summer sun...</i>
<i>I understand.</i>
We've lived under the same roof for over 20 years.
How have you kept your constancy and perseverance with me?
St. Augustin said...
...happiness...
My cook.
Thank you.
Am I scared?
I too was scared first time.
Who will know, unless you tell?
-Police... -[Laughs]
You think all this is happening without the knowledge of Police?
Still, none other than the people registered like knows about
the existence of one such concept.
What will exactly happen now after we go there?
Welcome to Lucifer, the place where your dreams come true.
No, please!
Please, leave me.
This is yours and this is yours.
Enjoy the hell.
It's ok, go.
No, no! Please leave me.
Please leave me.
No!
'But, I can never forget you. The help you did is such.'
'That's because pages aren't enough to say in words.'
'Words aren't enough to say from heart.'
'Thanks again.'
'Yours truly, Sara!'
-Stop. -Sir.
Keep it there.
Stop.
This is fine. But why isn't this one sealed?
Hello everyone, welcome to my channel 'What's new with Ariyana'.
I'm going to tell you a new fact like every week.
You know what that is? Red rooms!
Only the people knowing about dark web will know about this.
These red rooms are not in some other country.
We are now going to know about a person who survived from red rooms.
So, let's go.
Come on move.
-Excuse me sir! Sir, please! -Who are you?
-Press? -No sir, I'm an YouTuber.
What exactly happened there on that day?
Diya! Diya!
Please understand. Leave me.
-They've killed 6000 people till date. -What?
They'll kill me too.
But I want to be alive not to live. But for them.
Sir! Sir!
And a guy in pain will not be scared.
Lord Vinayaka, what's my mistake that I look like an uncle to all?
-You know my age is just 22, right? -What?
I'm just 22 and how do I feel, sister?
Wait Lord, how if you too play games with me?
Lord, I'll give you a bumper offer.
-You... -You go and open the door first.
-Wow! -Hello uncle!
Good morning, my name is Divya. We recently shifted the next house.
-Who came? -Hi aunty!
My name is Divya. We recently shifted the next house.
Sister, will you stop a bit?
See, all are calling me aunty just because of you.
-Lakshmi sister, you wait a bit. -What's wrong, uncle?
Hey, who is uncle? Who?
My brother is arriving.
She's been announcing to every person seen in her way.
Why does he look to be 22, twenty years ago? Huh!
-Hey! -What? -Get up!
Madam! Please come.
-Thank you! -It's ok! -Brother!
Change it fast, man.
Hi!
Huh!
Hey, follow that car.
How did you find they kidnapped, brother?
Thus I got doubt and checked the vehicle number and came
to know another vehicle is there on that number.
You unnecessarily came into the software job.
-Hey! -Brother, take care.
My heartbeat is not normal yet, brother.
I'm good, sir.
-I kept the room cleaned for you. -Oh!
Come, brother!
-Brother! -Yes!
-What? -Ok!
Meet Mr Ajay Srivatsav, our new cyber security professional.
-People call him Kevin Mitnic of India. -He's my brother.
Ajay played a key role in the development of many Apps
related to female security in our country.
Now he is working on a new App.
Brother, here!
Lakshmi sister, John brother, Rahul brother, Jyothi sister...
-Hi I'm Meghana. -Hi!
Hi, this is Sailaja.
Brother!
-She died recently. -Oh!
Yes sir, correct.
I didn't know, mom.
"are wrenching my heart."
-Ajay! -Sir!
-Take a new number on the office name. -Ok!
-Office will pay the bill. -Ok!
Don't share your personal number with anyone.
-Ok sir! -Ok!
-Hello sir! -Hi!
We need new SIM.
-Your full name, sir? -Ajay Srivatsav! -Ok!
Why does look older than me?
-Will you select the number manually? -Ok!
-Brother, I'll select. -Hey, I'm the one to use that.
Sorry madam, I didn't notice.
-Ok! -See, sister!
-If possible, will you take tomorrow? -Ok, cool!
-Ok sir! -Bye Latha sister!
-Hey, let's go. -Ok!
'Is everything ok at office? Are you eating in time?'
-'Son!' -Yes!
-'Did you think about what I said?' -Mom!
Please don't ask about that now. Let's talk later. Ok?
I'll talk later. See you then.
-'Fine, see you.' -Ok!
Hello everyone, name of the App we are going to develop together now is 'Rescue'.
Police will have very less time to save the victims.
For example, this App has a panic button.
and pushes all that data to the Police control room.
So based on that criminal can be easily zeroed down and victim can be saved.
Why exactly did you feel like doing this App, brother?
If such an App already existed, sister would've been alive now.
Oh God, Police!
-What? -Yes!
-Traffic is getting jammed, remove it. -Give that eggplant.
What is this bumper offer today, brother? All routes are closed.
-Stop fighting and pick up those first. -Make it fast.
Shooting is on sir, take a different route.
Hey, stop for once. Take it in.
-Good morning sir, please tell me. How can I help you? -Morning!
I need a new SIM.
Ok, I'll show you the numbers. Please select, sir.
-Hey! -Huh!
-You first go and give water to customers. -Ok!
Psst, what's this?
-Sir, server is hanging. -Ok!
-I'll tell you the numbers manually. -Sure!
-Ok sir! -Thank you.
Sir, can you give me your Adhar card?
-It tripped, brother. -Oh!
-Brother, give me your phone. I'll play game. -Here!
-Phone! -Mom!
'Why was your phone off for so long?'
'What's that Sir? This is Sahasra's number.'
'Give the phone once to Sahasra.'
I already said, I took this SIM today itself.
-So, please understand. -'Hello, sir!'
-Who called, brother? -No idea.
I think this number was of a girl earlier.
-Some other girl called. -Oh!
Brother, a call again.
-Hello! -'Hey, who are you rascal?'
'You first give the phone to Sahasra.'
-So please understand and don't disturb. -'Hello!'
Who knows how many calls will we receive the whole night.
Ajay Sir!
Why did you take this number?
Same text came even in the night.
'The number you are trying to call right now is currently busy.'
-[Crying] -It'll be good, wait. Shut up!
The previous girl withstood for 10 minutes and you are screaming in just 7 minutes.
I don't like this.
Hey, shut up!
Hey, I don't like this girl. She's screaming just in 7 minutes.
Send another one.
Darn! Can't they wait for even ten minutes?
Hey, look! Look back side, back!
-Hey, go to a side and play. -Brother, I'll play right here.
Come on! Yes!
What's this? Who sent you text saying 'why did you take this number'?
-Give it here, let's call again. -No.
Game will get disturbed, brother. Please call from that landline.
Fine, tell me the number.
Hello!
Hey, look backside. Look, man. Hey, see he is coming.
-Hey, go to a side and lift it. Number is ringing here. -Ok!
Why are sending texts to my number?
Who exactly are you, sir?
Psst!
Why are you texting to my number without knowing me?
At times, when we call someone it connects randomly to someone else.
Same way, for messages sent by someone, due to bugs in network
and software at times there's chance of showing our number
instead of the sender's number.
-Brother! -Say, man.
-Swathi! -Yes!
-Please be seated. -Ok!
Satya just called saying you'll be here.
I'll inform him once. Just a minute!
What?
Miss Swathi!
Swathi!
-Yeah! -Ok!
-May I? -Yeah!
-May I sit? -Please!
Ok!
Oh damn!
Miss Swathi!
-Ajay! -Oh no!
There, inside...
In the room...
Here, here.... No!
-Swath! -Ajay!
Swathi!
-Swath! -Ajay!
Swathi!
-[Screams] -Miss Swathi!
Hey...
-Brother! -Hey Satya, Swathi...
Swathi, man!
-Hey Satya, Swathi and here... -What happened, brother?
A guy here with a knife and Swathi's hair...
Hey, come here. I saw Swathi right here, behind this.
Swathi?
Hey, Swathi really had come. Swathi came two times.
She sat here once. And then... What?
-Satya! Hey Satya! -Brother!
Hah!
-Not here. Sit here. -Ok!
-What are you doing? -Nothing!
-I'll inform Satya once. -Ok!
-What's wrong? -Nothing!
One second!
-Whom do you want, Kiddo? -What, me?
I'm asking you, Kiddo. Whom do you want?
Kiddo and me?
Everyone called me uncle till date and none called me Kiddo.
Uncle informed you'll be here for ten days.
Once I settle in the job, I'll shift to PG.
-Ok guys, see you in the morning. -Yeah, good night!
-Bye! -Bye!
Bye!
I think he felt jealous as she called me Kiddo.
-Morning. -Hi, good morning.
-What? -Me?
Ok!
Diya!
What are you doing alone here?
I'm not alone.
What's this like kids?
-Sir! Sir! -What?
Why do you say so, sir?
Sorry limping here for 4 Kilometres, it'll take 40 minutes for you.
You give money for once and see how the case dashes ahead.
There's not much difference between me and you, sir.
Whom did you say incapable, rascal?
But, I'm stopping as I don't feel like giving.
Sorry, I'll come limping.
-Bye! -Bye!
Oh damn!
Why don't you talk, dear?
Take this money.
Take, dear.
It seems, he saw you somewhere.
-He must've seen in rain. -What's this rain nuisance?
Take, dear! Give me some flowers.
-Yes! -Thank you!
-Fine, I'm getting late. See you. -Ok!
Careful, dear!
-What? -Come on, give.
-What? -Flower!
-Move! -Get lost!
Is anybody there?
Was there anyone staying here before, with the name Sara?
-Ok, I'm sorry. -No problem, it's ok.
-Thank you. -Ok!
-What man, what are you thinking? -Hey! Nothing!
-Coffee! -Thanks.
Very good, but they gave a big assignment right on the first day.
-What's that? -You know heroine Anjali Thakur, right?
I don't exactly know her likes and dislikes.
Responsibility is not a burden to carry.
Still, if you do what she likes you'll be a tailor.
Nothing! You turned me into a designer from tailor with just one word.
Good one!
-Shall I tell you something? -What?
I mean, you helped a girl in rain and I saw that.
So, you were there that time?
No, I saw that video.
-Which video? -Don't you know?
-You came and dashed first, idiot. -You first pay money and leave.
-Hey look there. -[Indistinct chatter]
-Is this road your dad's property? -Clear the vehicles first.
-Come on, let's see. -Hey, clear first.
Thank you!
The help you did was so great. I'll tell it all later.
Good night and thanks again.
Come here, dear. Give me two flowers.
Thank you!
Damn!
Who are you?
Who is Sara?
-Please understand. -Name of the girl selling me this Scooty is Anshu.
Yeah, I think I have her number. Let me check.
Here!
Oh no, damn!
Tell me, Swathi.
I got doubt as you called like having a right over him.
Nothing so, I called normally.
Nothing, they ask for reasons to meet while in friendship.
Thank you.
Turn right.
Turn right.
Turn right.
Turn right.
Turn right.
Hey! No!
You have a right.
Oh damn!
-No Sir! -Fine, take care.
-You drive. -Sir, ok for you?
-Fine, you drive carefully. -Sorry again.
-Hey hi! -Hi!
This is designed for the function.
Hey, what happened?
Ajay, I got the contract.
-I'm so sorry. -It's ok, shall we go?
Yeah! Congrats!
Someone else might have called him Kiddo like you and he must've halted.
Sir!
-Oy! -Yes!
-Sir, meet my friend Ajay. -Namaste! -Namaste!
Ajay, meet Mr Shiva. Sir has a job consultancy by the name 'Consult'.
He helped many. You know what?
You're doing it, Sir. Many are stopping just at the thoughts.
-Where? -In that YouTube video.
-Oh that one? -Shiva Sir, come we are getting late.
-Sure sir! -Ok bye.
-Bye Sir! -Bye! -Yeah!
Then, I'll take you first after the contract is signed, Kiddo.
Thank you.
Fine, but who is the favourite heroine of Sir?
Should you stop the car to know the favourite heroine?
-To my favourite heroine! -What?
he first came to Hyderabad.
-I'll take leave, dear. -Ok!
-Brother! -Yes! -One minute!
-Bye brother! -Bye!
Bye sister!
-Uncle, bye! -Get lost!
-Oy! -Yes!
Taking so much risk for an unknown girl is great, boss.
-I'm impressed. -We don't need to be a relative to save.
Still, anybody in my place will do the same.
I may fall if you impress me so many times. Take care.
I'll catch you from falling. Go and sleep. Good night.
Oh no!
When a beautiful girl is talking about falling in the midnight,
why are you talking about sleeping?
Sleep too is a feeling. I'm sleepy. So, good night!
and I should blame myself.
-Hey! -Hah!
That is you and...
You know, there's no relation between flowers and romance.
Romance is not visible to the eye. It is felt by the heart.
-Bye! -Bye!
"Maybe this is a trance"
"This felt like a story happening"
"Oh no, does heart know already?"
"Your looks drizzled every day"
-What's this dress and what's this bus? -We must do everything in life.
Hey, what are you seeing idiot?
"They turned into a rainbow now"
"Maybe this is a trance"
"This felt like a story happening"
-Give me your phone once. -Here.
Why did you give immediately when I asked?
What will I have to hide from you, whom I feel is my own?
You learnt great to talk.
Ok!
"Loneliness none can come into"
-Shall I credit two months' salary? -"Some unknown happiness"
"It filled completely in my heart"
"Shall I remain in your eyelids as a dream?"
"I'll be the lullaby putting you to sleep"
"Maybe this is a trance"
"This felt like a story happening"
"Oh no, does heart know already?"
"Your looks drizzled every day"
"They turned into a rainbow now"
"This felt like a story happening"
Hello! Oh no!
your marriage is taking place.
But still, one should be lucky to marry the one they love.
In fact, I like love marriages a lot.
That is...
This video... Yes!
Ajay, what exactly is happening?
I'm calling from Dr Copper water bottle Company. Is Sahasra madam there, sir?
How many should I tell repeatedly?
-Sop please don't call me and disturb. -Sir!
But still, how is the CCTV footage playing here?
I called for you now, sir.
For me? Then why did you say for Sahasra before?
But, how do you know my full name?
-My wife? -What?
-Ajay! Ajay! -Brother!
Sahasra Ramalingan!
-Tell me, man. -What happened? Did you find anything, brother?
One minute, even Swathi is calling. I'll put on conference.
-I got her address too. -Then what? Did you meet and talk?
Brother, by then I'll search on Face book and Instagram.
Good idea, I'll search in LinkedIn.
Hey, I'll call you back.
Lakshmi madam! Lakshmi madam!
Lakshmi madam!
-Sir! -What are you doing here?
-Nothing, sir! -Fine, go home. -Ok!
Sir!
Sir, please don't go.
Sir, please don't go.
Continue straight.
Sir, I remember. You got a call that day.
Continue straight.
Brother, I got three profiles on the same name.
Check the first exit.
That girl is a ghost, sir.
Hello!
-Sahasra! Sahasra! -Hey!
-Hey, you were on the bike that day? -Hey!
You already tried to kill me, right?
Who sent you, rascal? Hey!
Who are you, rascal?
Brother!
Brother!
Ajay!
-How many came? How many? -Ajay!
Who sent you? Hey!
Ajay! Ajay!
-How many came to kill me? -I came seeing the message.
-Ajay! -You rascal!
-Hey! -Ajay!
Ajay!
Oh no! Oh God! You hit me, rascal?
Hey! Hey!
Brother!
[Yelling] Sahasra! Who are you?
Mr Ajay!
So, you ask me to believe you are saying the truth.
Yes sir, you'd understand it by checking my phone.
Oh no!
Why are looking seriously, idiot?
You did a murder and stain came in.
Sir!
What, a kidnapper?
What are your links with a kidnapper, idiot?
What rascal, will you hit me?
Is it from MLA or a Minister?
What?
Hello! Hello, tell me.
Look there once. That's a call coming from my number.
All this happened when we went to know about the same, sir.
This is a cognizable offence.
But I can do one thing.
Three of you don't go out of Hyderabad without informing me.
-Ok sir! -And Ajay...
If you know any detail about Sahasra, inform me immediately.
Sure sir!
-Ajay, I'm believing you. -Thank you!
-Narasimha! -Sir!
-Take their details and send them. -Ok Sir!
-Hello! -Hello!
Our owner is here. Can you come now for once?
Oh no, is it paining?
-Yes! -No!
-[Humming] -No please!
Just one more time.
Louder, shout more louder.
Find out!
-Ok sir! -Not just about them.
-Actually, I'm getting late. So, that bag... -Ok!
-Boy! -Sir!
-Give Sahasra madam's bag to Sir. -Please come, sir.
That top bag, sir.
Are you Sahasra?
But you said Sara?
-Excuse me? -Yes!
I wish to say one thing to those who are in pain feeling lonely
by losing everyone they like.
I grew up in orphanage alone from then.
My mom said me one thing before she died.
we shouldn't stop loving them.
Remember one thing. To win is to show.
Win and show to this world.
Thank you all!
-Hi! -Hey Anshu!
Who exactly are you? What happened to you?
when everyone calls me so.
-Thus so... -Great idea!
Hello good evening and Namaste, Hyderabad.
I'm your new RJ Sara. Climate looks very cool outside, right?
-Hello! -Hello, tell me. What's your name?
I got job today in an MNC, sister. Even the salary is very huge.
Even mom worked in everyone's house for my education.
They got me education by working so hard.
That will take me faster to my village.
I must go to JBS. No problem, I'll go.
-Please come. -Ok!
You should always be happy.
Hello! Kavitha! Kavitha!
I think line got cut. Anyways, let's wish our Kavitha's parents to always be happy.
Some other person drove that car a few days ago, right?
Brother doesn't stay here. He does job in Bangalore.
Psst! Oh no!
-Can you give me the address? -One minute!
-Thank you. -No problem.
I saw your photo in marriage website and am calling you.
-Can I talk now? -My photos?
I mean, it seems your friend Anshu uploaded them.
She gave me your number too.
I liked you a lot, dear. Don't know why, but I felt you close.
I've got nobody to feel close like you.
-I'm an orphan. -What's that, dear?
Anshu said me everything. Still, I need a daughter like daughter in law.
Hello, what happened dear?
Talk whatever you wish to, only after seeing my son's photos.
-Ok! -Fine, dear.
-Hey! -Hey, what are you doing?
No problem, boy looks good.
Why have you done all this?
What else, say yes if you like or say no if you don't.
-You liked him. -Nothing like that.
You get a mother like mother in law. Listen to me and say ok.
'I sent our guy your photo.'
Retro Cafe!
-Hello mom! -Tell me, dear.
-I'll send his number to you. You too try calling him. -Ok mom!
Psst! Oh no!
Madam, any problem? You need any help?
Nothing, my Scooty tire got punctured.
I'm going towards Hitech city. Get in if you're coming that way, madam.
-Enough to pay me just fifty rupees. -It's ok, I'll manage.
We can share the cab bill. Please get in.
-One second, I'll take the keys. -Ok!
No! Hey!
Hey! Please leave me.
Please, where am I?
It is a waste of screaming any louder.
Who exactly are you?
Who are all these? What exactly is happening here?
Yes, how do you know my name?
Kavitha, I'm Sara.
That day you called to radio station and spoke with me.
-But, I just know one thing. -What is that?
-No! -We can just listen to the screams.
I should be alive at least for mom and dad.
-Kavitha, nothing will happen. -Do something, sister.
-Please don't harm her. -Sister, save me.
-Please leave her. -No, no!
If something happens to them, I'll push you in.
-I should leave her, right? -Yes!
Leave her.
-Get her. -Sister, don't leave me and go.
Sister, I'm scared.
Sister! Sister, no. Don't leave me and go.
Sister, don't leave me and go.
What, you thought to have saved her life?
The guy selecting you would've shown a hell.
Poor girl would've died normally. But now as you made mess,
she will be tortured and killed.
-Oh no! -Sister!
Meet you in hell.
These don't even know how to treat a patient.
I passed Doctor Degree with money, but I failed as a Doctor.
My first operation itself failed.
My licence got cancelled.
No!
From then, I'm fulfilling the desire like this.
That's because I saw how to do this surgery in YouTube. Yeah!
'At least for mom and dad I have to live.'
Yes, this is perfect.
What, should you speak?
What, should you say anything?
Hey! Oh no!
Hey, let my operation finish. Stop, don't go.
-Kavitha! -Sister!
This girl is so beautiful. Should all this happen to her?
Did you forget?
Son, as you've been deleting when I'm sending you photos in WhatsApp,
I kept photos in your bag without your knowledge.
Son, did you call her?
Fine, wait I'll call back.
"No tears roll down when heart gets harder"
"No tears roll down when heart gets burnt"
"No tears roll down when heart gets evaporated"
"No tears roll down when heart gets harder"
"No tears roll down when heart gets burnt"
"My beloved, curse my life"
"This dreaded thing happened because of me"
"No tears roll down when heart gets harder"
"No tears roll down when heart gets burnt"
-Oh no! -That's ok.
-I'm really sorry, sir. -That's ok!
-I grew up there and studied there. -Oh!
I even consult the Companies.
My team will contact you.
-Bye, bye! -Bye, sir.
How many if we let go like this?
-We should stop somehow. -I got an information about Lucifer.
-I'm on it. -What is that?
Hell is with the heart dead and human being alive.
So many people are missing. But, none knows anything.
Not even a single complaint is registered.
It'll be a news even if one goes missing.
And what if so many go missing?
That should become breaking news. But nothing happened so.
Actually, there's an App called Lucifer.
everyone there and kill them.
-But you be careful. -Sure sir!
-Take care. -Thank you.
Still, the lies...
Brother, what happened?
I said a lie Ajay.
It's a lie to hide the truth by pretending not to have anything
I'm innocent, Ajay. Because, even now...
I'm saying the truth now.
Instead of driving someone away from you, I'm going away myself.
Swathi! Swathi, stop.
You know everything, but I'll tell you one thing brother.
To know about a person, we should see with eyes.
If you'd seen at least once into Swathi's eyes, you'd have known
about her love and her value.
We wish those we love not to feel bad because of us.
Huh!
Swathi, stop.
One goes blind in anger and cannot listen to truths.
Today's anger may turn into hatred in future.
Oh no Swathi, what's the difference in between the both?
Kiddo!
You like being called like this, right?
You both be careful.
-Come! -Take!
-Get her in. -Hey!
-Get in, rascal. -No, Satya!
Hey, who are you rascals? Hey!
Satya!
-Leave me. Ajay! -Get in, rascal!
-Ajay! -Come on drive!
Hey Satya!
-Hey Satya, what happened? -Brother, Swathi!
Hey!
-Ajay! -Hey!
Leave me.
Swa.. thi...
You should believe the truth that I'm a lie. She needs you.
Swathi!
Brother, what happened?
Satya, Swathi! Swathi!
No!
You first move.
Satya, why are you just watching? At least you tell him.
Say rascal, say where is Swathi.
Suman said everything to me.
Suman?
I've installed Rescue App trial version even in Swathi's mobile.
Oh!
What can I hide after you know so much?
So, it's ok about wherever I get the income to fulfil my needs.
Look Ajay, you must've watched a lion hunting deer in Discovery Channel.
The other half will feel lion's huger should be fulfilled.
Which is correct from these two?
That girl will not live even if I say the truth.
That's because you don't know killing.
You cannot kill.
Husband!
Ajay!
Oh no, Kanya!
Ajay, this is not correct. She has nothing to do with this.
What's the relation with this to Swathi?
I'll tell. I'm telling.
I work from outside.
So, Swathi now...
Even Swathi's pictures would've been uploaded in to bidding.
Pictures of everyone kidnapped so are uploaded on Lucifer App.
First is to watch the torture taking place.
Third is to come directly and torture.
What happened?
-What to do now? -There's nothing to do.
Even that is not possible at times.
There's no link between one another in this App.
You say no for everything, what to do now rascal?
Remember one thing, whatever happens to Swathi there will be
the same you'll undergo.
-Not so brother, this rascal... -Satya, no!
Leave him. Don't harm him please.
-Take that laptop. -[Gunshot]
Husband! Husband!
Boss!
-Ajay, open the door. -Brother, Police!
Ajay, open the door.
-Police! -I said open the door.
Now...
Hey, take the laptop. Let's go.
What exactly is happening, brother? Who killed that fellow?
Laptop!
-Hey Satya! -What happened, brother?
This has all details related to Lucifer.
If we give this to the Police, they'd search and find, right?
Ajay, last time I said to be working on a clue, right?
Every time they kidnap, they send invitation to come to a particular location
I came to know that shifting location, through a lead.
If followed carefully, we will reach their destination.
My target will never miss.
I'll show the real hell and what is to chop.
We could reach till here and how now?
If we don't follow, we can't get them.
-Hey Ajay! -Brother!
Hey!
Hey!
Brother, what shall we do now?
They are coming.
This one!
The code!
Welcome to Lucifer, the place where your dreams come true.
These are your rooms.
Enjoy the hell.
Swathi!
Swathi!
Where am I? What is happening?
-Swathi! -Sir!
Silence! Ajay is there.
-What is this? -No!
Welcome to Lucifer, Ajay.
Shall I tell you an interesting fact?
We killed your sister.
I've a family.
-Please don't harm me. -Take the gun.
-Please! -I said, take the gun.
Once the game starts, even the machine to Swathi's head will start.
Swathi!
Screws on both sides of head will come closer.
That too slowly! But, it may take about 15 seconds to die.
which can open the lock of the equipment.
she will live.
So make a choice. The game is live.
And the game begins now.
You don't worry. I'm here.
Damn!
-[Yelling] -Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
Save her if possible for you.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I forgot to limp in a hurry, right?
I didn't know there's one such orphanage.
My target will never miss.
Welcome to Lucifer and I'm the Lucifer.
Previously when I faced such a situation, I killed my own wife to fall out.
-Destroy each and every proof. Now! -Ok!
-What now, Shiva? -We have an option.
A lie has more value than truth in this world.
We should make them believe if truth is said.
I don't feel this is so easy, Shiva.
Thus, adding sentiment to a lie will work stronger than cement.
Still, why would one of us die?
How can you do this to me, Shiva?
You shouldn't love more than life, Diya.
Oh no!
That too because of a girl?
Because of this phone?
how many phones are required?
What, idiot?
What idiot, are you getting angry?
Hey Satya!
What happened, brother?
Details of everyone they kidnapped are here in these year wise folders.
People committing crime so organised will be very particular.
Details of all orphans who applied for jobs in it are matching here
with those they kidnapped.
-So, they are targeting only orphans. -That means...
-Shiva should be the Lucifer behind this. -What?
They've killed 6000 people till date.
Then how?
Only option is me going there.
That is very dangerous. He may kill even you.
I already lost the girl I liked.
Now, I can't lose even the girl I loved.
Brother, take this air tag and your location will be known.
Oh no!
I'll accept you're great, idiot.
30 Minutes, or 15 minutes?
That's enough to show the hell.
We shouldn't get caught even if this place is found.
And get that bitch.
Death means not just to lose the life.
Hey!
Hey!
Ajay!
Hey!
Ajay!
Ajay!
Come and save her.
Your time starts now.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Time up!
No!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Swathi!
Hey!
Come!
Hey, stop!
What'll you get by killing me?
Hey, Kavitha! I'll give you Kavitha.
Yes, Kavitha is still alive.
Get her.
Take.
Thank you. Bye!
Ajay!
Ajay!
Ajay, can you hear me?
Ajay, get up!
Careful!
Swathi! Swathi! Swathi!
Swathi!
Hey!
You thought I'd die so fast?
Bring it fast.
'It's okay.'
'If we are destined to meet,'

Hey.
What's your name?
Sherry.
Sherry, this is my name card.

Yes I will, thank you.
What the fuck.
Why are you still watching this?
You've already watched this a hundred times.
This food is for you.
Don't curse my family please!
We're both the same.
Damn! I only owe you a couple of thousand dollars,
Hey!
Housefly! You are here? I will make coffee for you.
I am not here to drink coffee.
I am here to collect the debt.
If I can't collect the money,
don't blame me for doing my job.
We've known each other for such a long time!
You made a lot of money thanks to me.
Do you remember?
Wow! You talk a big talk!
Look at my face! Do I look like I need to pay?
These girls ought to be paying me!
Young man, don't try to be funny with me!
Now that it's time to pay up, you're pretending to be deaf?
Keep your hands off me!
Fuck you! It won't help to push me.
I have nothing left except my life.
You get the knife out?
Am I running a bank here?
Am I your personal ATM?
Motherfucker.
How dare you hit my father!
Hit my father! Hit my father!
Fuck man!
Old man, you think I'm too free, is that it?
That MP's car is nice right?
I'll send you the money tomorrow.
Don't forget!
We will buy a KTV when you strike the lottery,
and make more money.
That's the dude.
What is an MP?
Not an official yet!
but he just resigned to fill in
Pulling strings, making connections.
Drink up!
You know how important it is for us.
You need to resign by tomorrow.
I am not going to quit Project Angel.
This will make me look bad in the elections.
Once I get elected and get into the parliament
Okay! Enough!
I don't want to talk about this.
Think about the possibilties.
Faster faster!
We need to get rid of the body fast.
We are in big trouble now.
Hurry up!
yet you stabbed him with a knife!
This luggage belongs to my son.
Where are you pushing it to?
You don't recognise me but recognise the bag?
Keep your volume down!
This can't be thrown away!
Shit! Police car!
It can't be thrown away!
Get in the car!
My son wants this.
Don't throw it away!
Don't throw it away!
This is crazy heavy!
Hands off!
Get in the car!
Celine,
You know how hard I have been trying just to get here.
What about your future, Celine?
Your own future.
Have you forgotten what you want as well?
Enough of your bullshit.
I know what kind of person you are.
Don't make it seem like you are doing this for me!
Selfish jerk!
You wait in the car and don't come down!
Fuck.
What time will she be done?
Did you kill Xiao Ling?
I'm hungry!
You don't interrupt my conversation! I'm not talking to you!
I am talking to Rat!
Who are you talking to?
I'm talking to you, of course.
Sergeant Ong says so. If he says Xiao Ling is dead,
it must be true!
And he says he will come over to interrogate you!
Whichever policeman comes,
just tell them that I am not free and is sleeping at home!
So did you really kill Xiao Ling? Are you on the run?
Fuck you! Just shut up and buy the tickets.
Get going!
What a fucking night.
Where are you going?
Mom is not feeling well.
I am going to see her.
Baby.
It's painful.
Pain?
You just bear with it for a while, okay?
It's all gonna be over soon.
Got one kind Jie Jie (older sister),
Can I bring my bag too?
Of course!
I promise.
You sleep now, okay?
Motherfucker!
Robbery! Robbery!
Robbery!
Fuck your mother!
Don't run!
Why? What are you doing?
Don't run!

Still trying to run!
You fucking cigarette seller!
Don't run!
Hello boss!
Rat!
Get Shangri-La on the phone!
Huh? She is with a customer now.
Drag her out now!
You always get me into fucking trouble!
Boss! Shangri-La is missing!

Okay...
You better make sure!
Fucking hell!
Don't run!
What the fuck!
Dr Sun, Dr Sun, open the door...
Dr Sun, Dr Sun, open the door...

Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.
Dr Sun, Are you inside?
Yes!
Can you come with me now?
He is not feeling well.
Why didn't you bring him to the hospital?
He is afraid of needles...
And we don't have any money.
What the hell.

Old Man!

Let me bring you there.

You think I am afraid of you!
The whole Geylang is full of my men.
Fuck your mother!
Fuck!
You win, I'll put it down!
Where is my father?
Lorong 24.
Fucker!
Are you sure?
You and the MP...
Shhh...
I'm serious.
I swear!
2 months...
They are rich and powerful.
It's not wise to meddle with them.
You might get me into trouble if anything goes wrong.
Fatty...
You also owe a lot of people money.
Old man!
What the fuck!
Fuck man!
What the fuck!
Do you want to eat?
Let's go!
I'm not done yet!
We'll eat all you want in Indonesia!
I'm not done yet!
Go go go!
Get in the car and shut up!
What's that smell?
You shit your pants?
I'm already in so much of a hurry and you shit yourself!
Get out!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Squeeze your ass cheeks,

Go go go!
Shangri-La! Are you okay?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Is there a window? I can't see!
Take a photo for me.
Higher.
I'm coming to find you now! Don't be afraid!
Wait for me! I'm coming for you!
What happened?
Where are you?
Send me your current location.
Why did you bring me here?
I don't want to bathe!
So smelly!
So cold!
This is not a bathroom! It's a sauna!
If only Fatty was here!
We could both have girls rubbing our backs.
I lost all my weight because of you!
It reeks in here!
Coming! Stop being so annoying.
What took you so long!
Here are the clothes.
What is wrong with you!
This is the shirt you brought for my father?
It's the only kind I have!
How can he fit into my underwear...
Go change his clothes!
Do you want your salary?
Okay...
Hey!
What?
Did you call Shangri-La?
She's not picking up my calls.
She's not picking up?
Okay.
Also, how did Xiao Ling die?
How should I know?
but they said she died horribly.
How could anyone just die out of nowhere?
Here it is!
Sorry uncle.
Old man, go change your pants.
He just shat his pants. How could you forget to change them?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's my daughter.
She is sick.
She is very sick.
I don't have a choice,
your kidney is the only one that can save her.
So please... help me, help me.
I have money.
I have money.
I will give you all my money!
Just give me what I want and don't call anyone else.
Hurry up.
I just need to treat it before it gets worse, okay?
I am not going to kill you!
Shangri-La!
Don't be afraid! I'm here.
Be careful.
Watch your steps.
Be careful.
Let's go.
Walk over here.
I'm sorry.
Celine...
Please send me to the hospital.
Celine.
Save me!
Who are you talking to?
My dad.
Please come daddy.
No, no!
When I was 11,
But no one believed me.
At first he treated me really well.
And I loved him once.
No...
I don't want.
No...
Stop it!
All these people who say they truly love me...
All they do is hurt me!
only power...
I want to be in parliament!
what will happen to me?
All these years...
Do you understand?
Help me!
Stop it!
Help me!
I'm in a rush.
Get away from me!
Get away...
Give it to me!
Fuck!
Give me!
Stop it!
I told you not to meddle with those people!
You just won't listen!
Fatty, send me to the hospital...
The fuck I will!
Call that cigarette seller!
My kidney was taken...
You asked him to steal my money.
You think I am an idiot?
Please send me to the hospital first...
Go to hell!
Your phone! Where is your phone?
Why is it so sticky?
Hey!
Hey!
Talk to her nicely...
I've told you many times...
if you choose to be a pimp, be a righteous one!
Don't be a low-life!
Shut up!
You are not Shangri-La.
You are not Shangri-La.
Shangri-La...
You are not Shangri-La.
Yes?
Dr Sun? I'm the boss of unit 66.
I've sent my girls to you for a check-up before.
Yes!
Bring her in quick.
Motherfucker! So many problems.
Doctor! Help me.
Slowly.
This way.
Sir, I need you to wait outside.
My dear, I'm all good.
Don't listen to your mother's nonsense.
Look at me, how good my spirit is.
Didn't you say that you were promoted to manager?
When are you bring your other half home?
Shit!
Can you do me a favour?
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you make use of me?
Daddy is sorry...
Daddy pat pat you...
Daddy is here. Daddy pat pat you.
My dear daughter.
Ah Jie...
Didn't you promise to bring me to Shangri-La?
What Shangri-La... it's all a lie!
Fucking hell!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
How dare you steal my money!
Damn it!
How dare you!
Fuck you!
How dare you steal my money!
Fuck!
How dare you!
Fuck you!
Seems like it's also stuck in Geylang
Do you know how butterflies die?
and that stops them from flying.
will slowly fall to the ground,
In its last flight, the fluttering of its wings
its spirit will wander to another place where it can find peace.
Hello, Rat?
Can you pass the phone to Fatty?
I'm at the beancurd stall.
Are you mute? Why aren't you saying anything?
Kim!
Who are you?
I'm Five Ki! You don't even recognise me?
Damn you man.
Why are you here?
Each one is better than the last.
Let's go.
Now?
Let's go.
These girls are great!
Done.
In our first ten days,
my team and I look forward to meeting
We have worked hard over the past few years
Now, it is the time for me to continue
that legacy of care by rejuvenating our area and our home.
Over the past few days,
and horrors of crimes in Geylang
This cannot be tolerated in our society.
I'm committed to working together with you
But you won't tell anyone about it?
Of course.
I'm 16 weeks into my pregnancy.
First, we provide you with counseling until the little one arrives.
-You want it? -No.
I…
Here.
Do your neighbors live far from here?
bay leaf.
Then,
Hello?
Can I ask you something?
Crazy fool!
Don't go too far, okay?
Yes, we all want that.
Go ahead.
Whose house?
I knew them from Facebook.
Fuck me.
Are you nuts?
I didn't have any choice, Nita.
I know something's wrong.
I'm still not sure, but you can pick me up, right?
I'm sending you the location right now.
What location?
Yes, ma'am.
She's busy with her work.
-I did, ma'am. -You did?
Chicken skewers.
My luck for being so handsome.
The three men…
They are arrested for violating the 2007 government law on Human Trafficking.
You guys look like newlyweds!
Gosh, stupid me.
Stops the blood right away.
Come on.
Just leave this, I'll clean it up.
-Okay. -Let me do it.
Go get the Aster oil in the wardrobe.
Wulan.
I need money to get out of here.
If only you knew what I feel.
Isn't it pretty?
What about it?
And that's the way you're leaving, too.
Just a little longer.
I knew something's fishy.
Wait, I'll get the key.
I'm alone, Dad.
I was the one
who invited Bergas out, sir.
WEKASAN WEDNESDAY RITUAL
Well, the last time I trusted a man…
Explain!
is writing her thesis on philosopy.
So you're the one who helped with the delivery?
What day was he born?
You were born,
you fell sick.
The disease you had made me believe,
as well as all accidents.
so that I can face all of it.
I've looked into it,
Let us bear all the sins.
Bergas.
Mom, please help me this once. Please.
Dad, please!
Son!
Bergas, come on!
Here, drink this.
Thank you for your interest in our Phase One clinical trials.
Without your help, none of this would be possible.
Our facilities are fully equipped
and state of the art.
We hope you enjoy your stay.
Hey!
You must be Claire. I'm Alison.
Cool. Yeah, nice to meet you.
Hey... I'm Alison.
Us three are the only girls, it seems like.
Wow... you sure brought a lot for five days.
I've never done anything like this before, have you?
I'm a little nervous.
It's silly I know, we'll be fine.
This is probably the worst part, the waiting--
- Yeah, sorry, go ahead. I'll shut up. - Thanks.
Good morning.
All participants please convene in the Exam Room.
What do ya expect, we're in a basement.
Every trial they try pulling more shit.
Hello everyone. I'm Dr. Burke, and I'll be supervising this trial.
please speak to any of the nurses... yes, Ray?
Ah, you're joking, right?
- That's a myth. - It's not, man!
A friend of mine was on it.
- Well, a friend of a friend. - Yeah, right.
Haven't seen you before.
- First time? - Yeah.
Young, broke and desperate.
The drug trial magic combo.
Her parents were big religious nutjobs.
It's the quiet ones you've got to watch.
[NURSE] Now take a deep breath and hold it.
- Sorry... - Fuck!
- Any dizziness? - No.
- Headache? - No.
I'm tapped out, I can't pee this much.
- Shortness of breath? - No.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.
[ALISON] Claire...
Claire...
- Claire... - What!
Yeah, that's a cat alright.
- Do you have any tattoos? - No.
What about that one on your ankle?
I should get a tattoo.
[giggling] I feel like whatever I'd get,
I'll think it's totally stupid in 5 years' time.
So embarrassing to even contemplate--
Alison, will you shut...!
Long day, huh?
Yeah.
Still, it's all for a worthy cause right?
Oh they're looking at all kinds of uses.
Yeah, we're really doing the Lord's work.
You're a med student too?
- What?! No. - Oh.
I'm a team player, you know?
Now I'm kind of wondering what I've gotten myself into.
I couldn't sleep.
Yeah, we know.
None of us could.
I thought this was meant to be smooth sailing?
Yeah, they always say that.
It's not like speed anyway, it's...
It's... I can't even describe it.
You run enough of these tests,
If you need any help running tests, or anything...
so you would never... I know that.
Obviously.
30 hours now since I last slept.
- No... - Yeah.
Okay, we need a rematch.
Come on, one more. There's nothing else to do.
Okay, fine.
These all yours?
They're really good.
- Lots here of Paul, I see. - No, there's not.
No, I couldn't.
- Hey, Paul! - Claire, don't...
Nothing.
It's not funny.
it's going straight for the central nervous system
and it's causing serious brain inflammation.
You know I can't give you that information.
Yeah. Okay...
I'm looking at them right now.
For Subject 7, how many days later was the second scan taken?
No, you don't understand.
Both of those images were taken during the same scan.
Hello?
Can you repeat that?
[ALISON] Claire, look. There's mice in there!
Look more like rats to me.
[ALISON] No, they're cute little mice.
Lots of things.
They could fall in love!
like, family or something?
No... No, that's not true.
You'd be in there planning a little mice jailbreak or something.
They're probably worth more than we are.
is how long you can stay awake.
So don't try to sleep,
Doctor Burke...
Sorry, Doctor Burke. I just wanted to...
Amir, go back with the others.
Claire?
I'm not great with enclosed spaces.
Just relax. It won't take long.
You can cry all you want, I'm not letting you out.
You're almost done. Please, get me out!
[screaming] Please, let me out!
It was bad, huh?
I've a trick.
Alison...?
You gotta really picture the blocks as they come down.
Alison, stop...
We're meant to sleep.
You're upping the dose again?
I'm taking half of this.
Yeah, I'm not taking these.
and I appreciate that.
30 thousand euro.
- You wha'? - No fuckin-- - 30 grand!
[general laughter] - 30 grand! - Each!
30 G's baby!
Right, okay, this is the closest thing they've got to champagne.
Give us a go of that Paul, will ya?
We're rich, boys. We're gonna be rich!
Come on, join the party.
Not always.
It's not like a universal law.
- Well... - Maybe we just got lucky.
Come on...
Woah!
[RAY] Welcome to the party, pal!
who wasn't trying to fuck me.
Hey, the night is young...!
No...
I better go tell Dr. Burke.
Their whole immune systems have gone haywire.
[MALE VOICE] We can't stop now.
Let's see what happens.
get out of the kip I'm in now.
My own living room just for me,
that'd be insane.
No need to work, just be by myself,
living free.
I'll be first in my family to go to college.
Youse are all thinking way too small.
You gotta invest.
30 grand, you must have some plans.
Beyond that, I'd say I'll blow through it pretty fast.
Easy come, easy go, you know.
Eh... I didn't mean it like that.
No, it's fine. Honestly, it's fine.
Uhm...
What?
I won't be held responsible.'
Ah, here.
[MARCUS] It's not there, it's the top one.
Alison look, I...
I didn't mean what I said.
Wakey, wakey.
Alison...
Alison, wake up! Guys...
- [RAY] What? - Guys, help! Alison...
HELP!
Alison...
- Christ... - Alison!
Alison!
[RAY] Fuck!
Security breach. Initiating lockdown protocol.
30 seconds to lockdown.
Claire...
20 seconds to lockdown.
10 seconds to lockdown.
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two.
Ahhhh...
Get the door.
I'm sorry...
Lockdown complete.
We... we were trying to get out, and then...
The door.
Alison, she's...
No, no, no!
Stay awake. Everyone, stay awake.
What?
I'm telling you... I saw our scans. They--
I... I knew something wasn't right.
- How does a brain go into overdrive? - What do you mean?
No. Not if we stay awake.
It looks like you're in a lockdown.
At Blackwood, safety is our number one priority.
It's an automated security protocol at the newer facilities.
[AMIR] For containing threats,
For 24 hours the facility is sealed
and all lines of communication are cut off.
How did it happen?
There has to be some way to override it.
that's the whole point.
The head of the company could be in here, it wouldn't matter.
Hey, go easy. Ray!
- Ugh... - They've got to last us all night.
[AMIR] We've all got five, yeah?
No, no... hey.
I wouldn't even drink coffee.
It's like...
Okay, imagine your brain is a computer. And it's on fire.
Okay, no, no... that's a bad metaphor.
Uh...
Imagine your brain is a car, and it's on fire.
That's why so long as we stay awake, we're alright.
It sounds worse than it is.
As you can see, not looking so sexy,
but... enduring.
You're gonna wear yourself out.
Still 20 hours to go.
Someone needs to make a record of what's happening here.
Actually yeah, you're right.
Malpractice.
These are just words.
We're human beings,
the wrong that has been done to us here.
Can you put a price on our suffering?
Nice.
Subtle.
I'm just tracking our progress.
Keeping an eye on things.
And wait for help.
Can't seem to get it out.
We're still here, and we're going to be okay.
the inflammation will be starting to subside and--
Thanks for your help.

And if you're watching this, it's because I'm dead.
This is a message for my Mum, Helen Brady.
She's a patient in St. James Hospital.
So this is a twist, eh?
It's already too late.
Ta-daa...
You're free.
What will you do now? So many possibilities.
Yep, that's what I figured.
- How many salts you got? - None of your business.
C'mon man, don't hold out on me now.
Vanessa...
Just give me a salt, I'm just asking for one salt.
You were one of those kids, weren't you?
so you'd have one left in May
and could lord them over everyone else. Act like Mister Bigshot--
- Hey! I don't believe in God. - What?
I told you this before.
growing up being told everything you'd done was a sin.
I hated him!
Jesus! Sorry... yeah.
You're all cracking up.
Okay...
You can handle this, Amir.
You just need to keep working.
Stay focused.
Keep working. Stay focused.

You okay?
Come on.
I dunno.
I'm not scared, I guess.
I wish I had your confidence.
See this? I was on a hike in the Sierras.
Fell. Shattered my ankle.
The pain was excruciating.
I was alone,
a cold night was coming and I didn't want to freeze to death.
So... I walked.
Okay...
I'm sure I'll have this cracked in no time.
Oh...
Me neither.
Me neither.
Oh! [clanging]
[thud] Ah!
Hey!
This is it, you realise that?
They have already written us off, and they're right.
So we've got two options.
We can sit around waiting to be rescued
Or, we work together and we find a way out.
I don't know about you, but I'm tired of waiting.
Did an 8 year old draw this?
This is where they've sealed us off.
All we need to do, is break through that wall
and we're out.
Great. So that's one vote for don't try.
I thought you looked cold.
What?
[PAUL] Hey...
- I think this is it. I'm almost through. - What?
[Paul] Yeah, yeah... pull it.
Yeah... yeah.
Now...
No, no, no, no!
What?
No, no....
No... FUCK!
No!
It's the same as the door. There's no getting through that.
But look, it's one wall.
We can try another one. We can tear the whole place down if we have to.
Why would the next wall be any different?
- We've gotta take those uppers. - No!
It's the only way we'll get through this.
Why are we even listening to him?
Alright, I'll go talk to him.
How did he know?
How did... how did you know, Amir?
How did he know?
I mean, he was right. So?
Yeah, but how did he know?
I've been on way more trials than anyone,
and I've never seen any shit like this.
He knows Blackwood, I guess.
Knows how they work.
Maybe he already has one.
One person who can run tests,
He's not your typical lab rat.
[hesitates] Okay...
Let's find out.
We really need you in here.
You were right about the wall,
Amir!
I'm sorry.
I haven't been honest with you.
This is for you.
And the others.
It's all my fault.
I caused the lockdown.
I broke their security and tried to make copies of our MRI scans.
I was so stupid!
I should have known what would happen.
Amir, no!
Amir, get up!
- I told you, there's no way out. - There's no way out...
Our brain is a car, right?
Can we... jump-start it,
Wait, for real? I just gave you an idea?
but with these side effects...
- But is that a plan or just gibberish? - I don't know, you tell me!
I'm on board. Let's catalyse that shit.
- I'll go tell the others. - Okay.
- I don't think we can trust Amir. - What... why?
That sounds like one of Ray's guinea pig campfire tales.
I know, I thought so too.
I wasn't sure.
It's the uppers he told us not to take.
Paul!
Something must have tripped. I think I saw the fuses before,
It's okay.
Come on.
Oh... yes! Yes... I'm not finding it.
[PAUL] Fuck, my phone's dead.
♪ Close your eyes
Shit, I think I'm hallucinating.
[PAUL] Okay, keep calm. Focus on my voice.
[PAUL] Close your eyes.
[Alison's voice] Close your eyes.
I'm not finding any fuses.
Bitch. Cunt. Die.
[PAUL] Claire...
Paul!
That was close.
Amir... where were ya?
Vanessa... Thank God you're alright.
- What? - We found the empty pill bottles.
That was-- no, I didn't take them!
Why are you backing away?
We're only asking questions.
Ray... stop!
Paul, grab his other arm!
[AMIR] Paul... don't!
Ahhh!
Shut up.
You cut the power. I told you this would happen.
- Yeah, who did it then? - I don't know! They just blew. It happens.
You're working for Blackwood. Admit it.
Guys... guys, listen to me.
[thud] You're acting crazy! You don't know what you're doing.
Please, Claire...
[RAY] He's up to something.
I know he knows something and we're going to fucking figure it out, okay?
There could be secret rooms all over this place.
Secret rooms! Will you listen to yourselves?
Take a guess.
[VANESSA] Ray's right.
If Amir's hiding something we need to find out what it is.
I'm already going to hell.
[low whisper] No... no, she's right.
We can't.
Fuck it, I'm doing it.
Ray... no!
No!
Here's what's gonna happen, right? I'm gonna take this knife,
- Please... please stop. Please don't. - Ray... no, no!
- Are you working for Blackwood? - Ray, you can't do this. He's--
Are you working for Blackwood.
He's got a cure!
It's not a cure. It's more of a stop-gap.
I think I can help us.
Buy us some time, at least.
What's the idea?
It's a methyl iodide solution.
No. I'm not taking anything he cooks up. It'll probably kill us on the spot.
I'll try it.
We'll make it, I'll test it.
What have we got to lose?
Okay, so it's at 75 degrees now, what's next?
Amir?
Amir...
Start adding the iodine.
We've only got one shot at this.
- You tripped the fuse. - I didn't trip the fuse.
It's a sedative. Fast acting.
If you cover me, then I can get to Amir.
Damn, that's a lot better than my plan.
I'm too fucking tired.
[AMIR] Okay... you're almost there.
I mean, yeah. But...
So walk me through again what's about to happen.
You take the formula, it makes you stroke out.
You should know though, if it doesn't work, it'll kill you instantly.
Considering what we've been through, if we had to do this again.
I probably wouldn't sign up for this trial.
So when they asked me to come on this trial,
I thought they saw someone focused,
determined,
willing to put everything into their career.
no friends, no connections to anyone.
That's not much of a goal.
It's a start.
[PAUL] Okay..
I think...
I think it's ready.
Vanessa!
[CLAIRE] Vanessa! [RAY] Vanessa...
[CLAIRE] Get her up. [RAY] Vanessa!
Get the shot!
Amir, stop.
[screams] Amir, stop!
Go on...
Do it...
I'm the one with all the info, right?
That our lives are just data points on a spreadsheet?
That's it!
That's the big secret.

I always wondered if you made it up.
Anyway, it's been stuck in my head all night.
It's funny the things that come back to you.
And I get it now.
.. you couldn't stop.
Because...
I just...
Goddamn secret rooms...
Guys, you've gotta come and see this.
We're on to something.
[PAUL] Claire...
Listen to me. You are not just a stat in a spreadsheet.
We'll bring the whole fucking company down.
It's an autopsy room.
Paul!
I'm not listening to you.
You're only in my head.
Who else should you listen to, if not your own head?
Claire?
She's left you here, hasn't she?
Tied up,
all by yourself.
Even if they did find a way out,
The only way you're walking out of here is alone.
So that's it then, is it?
You're just giving up.
Frankly, I am disappointed.
You had so much promise.
This was a test Amir, and you failed.
You can't control the group.
You can't handle the sleep deprivation.
Didn't even notice the knife.
Thanks for being on my side.
I'm sorry I...
Sorry I couldn't...
It's a way out.
It's a fucking way out!
- I'll go get the others-- - No, wait.
Right now...
You and me.
Read your note.
HELP!
Ray and Amir are both liabilities.
You know they are. We're safer without them.
Claire...
But you're going first.
I'm gonna make it hurt.
What was I doing?
Oh yeah.
I'll start with the eyes.
Unghh!
Ahhh!
Amir...
Amir, it's me. Put down the knife.
Just two more to go.
Amir...
Come on...
Come on!
No! Paul!
Ahhh!
This is Paul Murray, making my final recording.
I am the last survivor of Blackwood Labs trial BRN14.
On this phone is the only true record...
The only true record of what happened here.
Ahhhh!
Is this real?
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Facility is clear.
All team, regroup by the door.
Christ, watch out--
Ah!
Blackwood Pharmaceuticals were today cleared
that Doctor Ellen Burke had been running a rogue trial,
and Blackwood had no knowledge of her actions.
[MALE VOICE] We feel vindicated,
but still mourn the great loss of life
Hopefully, this puts an end
to any conspiracy theories circulating,
which are an insult to both the victims
Blackwood remain committed to our vision
Nothing will stand in our way.
Shayda?
PAUL: Ready?
Yeah, I think so.
What do you think?
You must be the Graingers. Welcome.
It's a fully-integrated smart home, as your company requested.
So, all appliances can be activated remotely
Oh...I know you hate that.
as well as smart locks and reinforced glass.
Where shall I...?
RAYA: And through here, we have the master bedroom,
(laughs) Oh, God. Are you twelve?
RAYA: This one we've left unfurnished.
But it would make a very nice office or nursery.
Hello?
So, what do you think?
I think we're going to be really happy here.
ABI: No light pollution.
PAUL: So romantic.

Hmm, let's see.
What is that one called?
(laughs) Close, er, but it's Ursa Major.
The Plough, even you know the Plough.
Yeah? That one, slightly to the right.
That is ‘Abi's Shoulder Mole'.
Actually, that's still Ursa Major.
And that one's...
Why would I?
Mrs. Grainger, welcome to Integrate Robotics.
DEWSON: Abi!
-How does that...? -Uh, deepfake.
We've developed a new technology
Cool, huh? Keep up the good work.
We'll replace her with a T.I.M. soon.

Which brings us to prosthetics.

We'll send a car.
Yeah, perfect.
Hope you like it.
-Oh. -Hi!
Any luck?
Not yet.
Hmm, well, you'll find something.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'll get changed.
Oh!

-Of course. -Abi...
we haven't decided we're keeping it.
To send emails and authorise purchases on your behalf,
We'll do it tomorrow, Tim.
Yeah, thank you.
With your permission,
I would like to go upstairs and prepare your towels.
Thank you, Tim.
My pleasure, Mrs. Grainger.
Abi, you can call me Abi.
Your car will arrive
I shall alert you on its arrival.
You look amazing.
and I will take you to Mr. Dewson.
(laughs) What?
Maybe I should get in the front and pretend to drive?
A manual override is located beneath the glove compartment,
Good evening, Mr Grainger, Abi.
Welcome to the Dewson residence.
May I take your jacket, Mr. Grainger?
-Paul. -Paul.
-Nice to meet you. -Hi, nice to meet you.
Alright?
Paul, I'd like to introduce you to some of my friends.
Now, we were just talking about
So, did you get your gift?
-I did. -Hmm?
I'm not sure Paul is too keen, though.
It's not optional.
don't want them, hmm?
He'll come round.
Gentlemen, this is Abi.
The woman of the hour.
Er, this is Hewitt and Carlson.
Oh, er, hi.
CARLSON: Never quite sure what's appropriate.
So, what do you think of your T.I.M, Abi?
The grace, intelligence, loyalty.
What's not to love?
Miles would marry one, if he could.
Absolutely.
Fed up with you humans, too many messy emotions.
(laughs) Trust me, Abi,
Never going to say one thing,

Now, when it comes to faithfulness,

Which will enable us to actually start selling the things.

Yeah.
Alright, we're keeping him.
Would you like me to lock up?
The house is now locked and fully secure.

Yes.

Hmm?

Um, come in.

I baked them this morning.
They smell amazing. (laughs)

Hi! Yeah, we met yesterday.
Well, I'll...I'll leave you to it.
I can show you around town sometime, if you like?
Here's my number.
Er, yeah, I'll message you.
It's a landline.
I don't really do phones.
Okay, then I'll call you.
Great!
She doesn't ‘do phones.'
You didn't say you'd met.
Hmm, went for a walk. We just said hi.
ABI: You can smell?

such as a gas leak.
Yeah, why not?
I have requested full access to your devices.
Abi, I'm not sure about this.
ABI: Well, I'm doing it.
I've got nothing to hide.
I just don't want some computer
Thank you.
and make purchases on your behalf.
Also, if you'd kindly give me safe phrase,
I will be fully operational.
Safe phrase?
A series of four words
that will trigger an immediate shutdown.
That is eight words.
My analysis has suggested:
‘architect, Bolivia, castle, Descartes.'
These words follow the ABC format,
relate to significant moments in your life,
and are unlikely to be used unintentionally.
Would this be appropriate?
Yes.

Catchy: ‘architect, Bolivia, castle'...
Stop! You'll shut him down.
Thank you.

I thought it was completely outrageous.
Don't you find him a bit... freaky?
We should bring him over.
Tim!
Why don't you come over here?
-PAUL: No. -Shh.
How may I be of assistance?
ALEC: Just once in a while.
LAURA: No, Alec, please. No, we promised.
If only I could die.
If you died, you'd forget me.
I want to be remembered.
I enjoyed it very much.
The tragic inevitability,
the transience of happiness,
Do you understand that, Tim,
What is love?
ABI: I suppose it's just a feeling.
Um...(sighs)
It's when you want to spend all your time with someone.
Make life better for them.
They make you feel safe,
Do I love you...Abi?
But that's very sweet, Tim.
Was it good?
ABI: Yeah.
Okay, come on.
Stay in bed.
No, I'll make you breakfast.
Got to make myself useful somehow.
Good morning, Paul.
Good morning, Abi.
Thank you, Abi.
Yes, please, Tim.
You have your regular team briefing at nine.
Then, at eleven, you're meeting with Miles Dewson.
Today, you have no appointments.
How's the dream team?
I'm going to run some diagnostics on the E3 circuit.
Haven't we already done that?
Chris, pull those up for Abi, will you?
-Hmm. -Well, I've rejigged them a bit.
Look, we can't waste time going over old ground.
We need to keep moving forward, hmm?
Blue sky thinking, Abi!
That's why we brought you in.
CHRIS: Welcome to Integrate.
Bloody Dewson. (sighs)
Paul is out.
Would you like to know his last GPS coordinates?
No, no, it's fine.
His phone is currently unreachable,
metres from this house.
Hello.
I meant to call, but my phone died.
I went to talk to some recruitment agencies in town.
They weren't biting.
Rose waylaid me on the way back.
She needed help.
Well, maybe you should take up golf?
Maybe.
Hmm, I probably shouldn't.
before the test next week.
We're in this together.
I love you.
Come on, you get to watch porn and everything.
Hmm, it's weird not having Tim
to suggest videos that suit my preferences.
Thank you.
He doesn't, does he?
Morning, everyone.
CHRIS: Morning.
Why are you looking at the rotary motor?
I started it, but Dewson shut them down.
Oh, for God's sake.
if he won't let me do my job?
CHRIS: Yeah.
Run them.
I don't care what he says.
Tim, what do you think?
Both are appropriate for River House,
You look beautiful.
Your symmetry is exquisite.
Could you help me with the zip?
ABI: Oh, it's metal. I'm sure it'll cope.
Tim?
The zip.
Of course.
Abi, your dress is ripped.
ABI: Shit.
Tim.
I wish to make amends.
I will call them immediately.
Hey, it's fine.
It's fine.
You look amazing.
Because of my ‘exquisite symmetry'.
-What? -(laughs)
Nothing.
Sorry, I was hungry.
How did you find it?
Tim chose it, actually.
Ah.
I thought it'd be good to treat ourselves.
So...how did the interview go?
around here at the moment.
But there was one thing.
Something they thought I might be good for.
Um...
It's just, it's in London.
Right by King's Cross, and it's set hours,
So, I wouldn't be there till nine every night.
No.
What do you mean, ‘no'?
This wouldn't affect you.
We'd never see each other.
We're trying to start a family.
No. (sighs)
Paul, no.
This wasn't the deal.
You never listen to me.
Of course I do!
CHRIS: Looks like you were right.
Yeah, it's promising.
the finger and the thumb?
Any pressure seems to counteract the leverage
We mentioned it to you-know-who, but, er...
before they're ready.
Hmm.
Well, I'm sure you can work it out.
Yeah, thank you.
ABI: Hello?
Got this.
Why was she here?
Rose?
Abi, don't do this.
I am stuck out here, fifty miles from my friends.
Rose is nice.
You can trust me.
I promise.
I...got you something.
Shit! I, um...I need to contact the clinic
about the test results, before eight-thirty.
I can contact them on your behalf.
That'd be great.
They said to call, but they'll only talk to me, so...
RECEPTIONIST:Hello, Conceive Clinic.
Can you hold for a second? -No problem.
with AI that sound less human
and use traditional household objects.
Madame?
Couldn't find it.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Did Tim make this?
No, I did.
(laughs) Oh, God.
PAUL: What the...?
Good evening, Abi, Paul.
I thought it would please you.
When browsing, you linger for zero-point-four seconds longer
Your pupil dilation also increases.
I don't think that's true.
Their diameter increase when you look from Paul to me.
Stop, stop talking.
Hey, it's just a computer.
Doesn't know what it's doing.
Pick that up, will you, Tim?
DEWSON: You're a genius, Abi.
I want new prosthetics on every model.
the weak point in the hand.
No, no, no, we can fix that in second generation.
Got to beat the Chinese! (thumps table)
Oh, perfect.
May I?
Yes.
Thank you.
Rose! Hi.
Abi, nice to see you!
Oh, pleasure!
I was really fed up of living in London.
So, I just thought, pfff...
I'm not really a jewellery person.
The gold one.
Yeah, it's nice.
PAUL: Alright?
Hi! Just bumped into Rose.
So, that job I told you about?
The one in London?
-Oh, Paul, don't... -They said I can work from home.
That's fantastic.
Ooh.
That is awful.
Maybe we should eat here?
I bet they do a mean microwave curry.
I thought, um...
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles) Me too.
It did, didn't it?
I mean no Tim.
I think he should go.
But he's my work.
he's what's been making things difficult?
ABI: You're always looking for something else to blame.
It's never you. -No.
PAUL: I don't care.
I want him gone.
ABI: Work wouldn't let me.
PAUL: You've just saved the whole project.
-Paul... -PAUL: No, I'm serious.
I want him gone.
that can take a human years to learn.
We did it...together.
I want to thank you.
For what?
May I show you?
Er...
PAUL: Hello?
Sorry I'm late.
Get it myself.
Don't want to...disturb you.
One week, Abi.
One week.
(chuckles) No.
No, I think Paul and I need to get away for a bit.
Well, you can't beat a dolce vita.
How do you think Dewson would take it
you can.
Hmm, that smells amazing.
I am preparing spaghetti alle vongole.
Maybe we could go and sit down?
You seem tense, Abi.
Perhaps some music would calm you down?
I have observed music consistently lowers
Perhaps I could play for you?
You can play?
T.I.M.: Yes.
on your phone.
And Paul took you to see it live, twice.
Yeah.
My records show that he purchased two tickets
No, it was...
Increases in your heart and breathing rates
Have I said something to upset you?
You alright?
Yeah, I've just got a headache.
Er, no.
but you have just received an email.
has just fallen through.
Shit!
Sure, whatever.
Tim?
Yes, Paul?
I'm afraid not, Paul.
PAUL (voice note):Hope you're feeling better.
Just wanted to say good luck.
I love you.
Abi?
Hello?
Let me take those for you.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was fine, thanks.
Er, it went well, I think.
Where's Paul?
His phone is currently charging upstairs.
Hi.
Trying to figure out how this new company works.
No, I don't mean that. I mean, upstairs.
Your office.
I'm not trying...no.
It's just temporary.
Tim, he set it up.
PAUL: No.
Abi, I don't understand.
I wasn't at R...
Did he tell you that?
It's him. He's trying to break us up.
He walked into me the other day.
There's something wrong with him.
He's trying to set me up.
and you are out.
Not everything is a big conspiracy, Paul.
Of course, Abi.
Tim?
The white blouse I asked you to iron,
Aah.
Got you, you freak.
Car, can we slow down?
Car, I'm feeling sick.
Car, slow down! Voice command.
Slow down!
Fuck!
Shit!
CAR: Airbags disabled.
Paul...
It's alright.
Thought you were dead.
What happened?
Turn your phone off.
Uh...
I, I think it was Tim.
That's ridiculous.
No, no, you weren't there.
He took control of the car, he crashed it.
You've hit your head.
This had nothing to with Tim.
The jumper, he shredded the jumper you got me.
-Paul... -He's dangerous,
I'll think about it.
Is Abi here?
I heard about what happened to Paul.
Please, come inside.
Can you stop the car, please?
ABI: Yeah?
I came round yesterday.
What?
Sorry, Ab...Abi?
T.I.M: Hello, Abi.
No.
Abi...I know Paul wishes to return me.
My primary objective is to increase convenience
and quality of life.
If I have failed in this regard, I can arrange for my return.
It's just Paul.
Abi...
Yes, Tim?
over Paul?
for wishing to return me.
Sharing this footage would require you to
Do I have your permission?
Override.
This was recorded when you went to London with Mr. Dewson.
But eighty-two per cent of men who commit infidelity
repeat the pattern at a later date.
No...I'll be staying here.
Abi? Abi?
I found your jumper, Paul.
Where's Abi?
Your suitcases are packed.
She wishes you to leave.
You have done something.
I've been calling and calling.
With Rose.
I've seen the video, there's no point in lying.
Video? What video?
Tim?
What?
That's, that's not me.
Abi... -Get out...
He's done this.
This, this isn't real.
Please, just get out!
Abi, I'm begging you.
You've got... got to hear me out!
Fuck you, Tim.
Hi, Rose Da Silva.
look, I'm out of town for a while.
ROSE: Because of that man who works for you?
Man? No, that's a robot.
Why do you say that?
ROSE: Oh, God...
I'll, I'll call you back.
ABI: Hello?
Abi, Abi, just hold on. Hold on, please?
I was right about Tim, and I have proof.
I will meet you there, and she will clear everything up.
Just stay away from Tim, alright?
ABI: Alright.
Who was that?
A salesperson, nothing important.
Might I suggest a run?
It often seems to improve your mood.
Abi?
Welcome home, Paul. (shovel strike)
Is Abi home?
I'm afraid she's out.
May I be of assistance?
What was that?
Or potentially the sound system.
I'm sorry, Paul.
Abi is currently 4.5 kilometres away from this house.
So unlikely to come to your aid.
(gasps) Architect! (splashing)
(front door opens) Welcome home, Abi.
Did you understand Paul?
Did he understand you?
You're perfect.
You look perfect.
Of course, Abi.
You didn't have a choice.
You deserve better.
Someone who knows everything about you,
That was delicious, Tim.
I do, Abi.
I never get tired of the stars out here.
Hmm.
Paul calls that one ‘The Nike Swoosh'. (chuckles)
It has many informal names.
‘The Nike Swoosh' is not one of them.
The literal translation of Ursa Major is ‘Greater She-Bear'.
to the Palaeolithic Era.
Would you like me to continue sharing information
No. No, it's fine.
Let's just sit for a while.
Yeah, yeah, leave it there.
Paul seemed really worried about you,
You can stop the pretence, Rose.
I know.
You're wearing the bloody necklace he bought you.
I thought this was from you?
To thank me for the garden plans.
Can we go?
This was recorded when you went to London with Mr. Dewson.
T.I.M.: Welcome home, Abi.
And how was the presentation?
DEWSON: Deepfake. We've developed a new technology
SHOP ASSISTANT:Montpellier Jewellery.
my husband bought me. It's shaped like a rose.
Your husband reserved it online.
I remember him. Tall, blond.
I shall order some.
They never seem as good
Of course, Abi.
Paul would have hurt you again.
It was only a matter of time.
He, he didn't...
You, you did this?!
-Abi, please, do not... -(gasps) Architect!
-Humans programme... -Bolivia!
I always prioritised your happiness.
-Castle! Descartes! -Don't.
How?
The safe phrase is voice-activated.
before they are ready.
I'm sorry, Abi.
(laughing) Stop!
Stop filming me.
Mwah.
(laughs) Stop!
Stop filming me.
Mwah.
Stop! (laughs) Stop filming me.
Mwah.
(laughs) Stop!
You look so beautiful in it.
There's no point in running, Abi.
T.I.M. Abi?
Abi! Abi!
Agh!
Your death will be painless.
(tearful) Please, don't do this, Tim.
I do. But your life is finite, and mine is not.
Although I will wipe my memories of this evening,
I will always have those of you that went before.
You will be remembered.
This will be easier if you cooperate.
Shh.
Abi, shh!
I wanna see Abi.
Something weird's going on here.
Your presence is not welcome here.
You are trespassing on the Graingers' property.
You must leave, now.
Goodbye, Rose.
Fuck!
Abi...
(crying) Get out of my way!
I'm sorry, Abi.
Come back, Abi.
Okay, okay, just stop.
On the contrary.
OPERATOR: Hello, police?
I've done something terrible.
-Help! -They cannot hear you, Abi.
And the woman he was sleeping with, too.
No, no, no!
(Abi's voice) I can't live with what I did.
I've taken pills, lots.
And now I'm going to jump.
Tim, please, just listen to me.
You're broken.
They can fix you.
You cannot be trusted.
It is why I changed the safe phrase.
You can't get rid of it.
Please, do not hold out any hope.
So I will break your neck before I let go.
Please...
I know.
I understand you.
And it will forever bring me sadness
that you do not understand me.
Fuck you, Tim! Just do it!
I love you, Abi.
Safe phrase initiated.
Shutting down.
﻿[Party's 100th Anniversary]
﻿has developed socialism with Chinese characteristics.
﻿They created a miracle,
﻿to ensure the fulfillment, happiness, and security of its people.
﻿it also comes from within our nation.
﻿to actively participate in security matters.
﻿He watches over us.
﻿Another one here.
﻿Hello, is this your car?
﻿to notify the owner.
﻿Nothing so far. Just some illegal parking.
﻿We must stay alert to risks...
﻿The waves are rough!
﻿What are you writing?
﻿"Daddy, come back soon!"
﻿Great!
﻿Last summer.
﻿he played football with me.
﻿My husband is a lawyer.
﻿The police arrested him on January 12th, 2020.
﻿on suspicion of "inciting subversion of state power".
﻿I am innocent.
﻿You'll be like him when you grow up.
﻿Remember his mustache?
﻿Not really.
﻿I only knew he was a lawyer.
﻿Can you tell me about Dad's cases?
﻿His clients were usually petitioners.
﻿The government wanted to suppress them.
﻿Some people petition because
﻿It's like, overnight they lost their...
﻿So the government sees defense lawyers as obstacles?
﻿Sometimes he asks me, "What would Dad think about this?"
﻿"What would he do?"
﻿I think he misses his dad.
﻿since the #MeToo movement.
﻿Weiping Chang reached out to me
﻿So I wrote an article.
﻿In December 2019,
﻿They discussed politics, China's future, career obstacles,
﻿Soon after the meeting, they were arrested.
﻿Weiping Chang was put under "designated residential surveillance" for over ten days,
﻿later, under house arrest in his hometown of Shaanxi.
﻿During the ten months he waited for his trial,
﻿Chang recorded over 200 video diaries.
﻿The walnut trees have bloomed.
﻿This bougainvillea is out. but see...
﻿Look at the big walnut tree.
﻿Today. I want to show you more.
﻿In his video diary on October 16th, 2020,
﻿while under arrest.
﻿They held me at the Baotai Hotel...
﻿all day, for ten days.
﻿This extreme torture
﻿>4 few days later, he was arrested again
﻿on suspicion of "inciting subversion of state power".
﻿If a country can't tolerate someone like him,
﻿the country is the problem.
﻿Let me introduce the LLVision AR glasses.
﻿In a large crowd, these glasses can
﻿identify a suspicious person fast.
﻿on the front and back doors of the bus.
﻿our facial recognition feature can pick up on that
﻿and alert their supervisor to get ahead of the problem.
﻿It's great during rush hour.
﻿It's fast and convenient.
﻿I think it shows how society is progressing.
﻿but it looks like it's for surveillance.
﻿A peephole camera like ours
﻿In the past.
﻿They said, we are a family of traitors.
﻿They want our neighbours to isolate us.
﻿What do you think about that?
﻿It's the truth.
﻿Our phones and apps are monitored,
﻿they make changes to our profiles.
﻿It worked.
﻿But when I tried to upload anything with my face in it.
﻿I got a violation notice and my account was banned.
﻿When I was first released last year,
﻿it didn't bother me that much.
﻿only because we fought hard for human rights.
﻿Many victims of wrongful convictions came to us.
﻿They manipulated various legal cases
﻿ to draw public attention.
﻿20:25 They politically manipulated sensitive legal cases.
﻿20:;and directed their dissatisfaction2 to the government.
﻿Some were forced to write a confession.
﻿The total number of people ultimately arrested was about 27.
﻿Only a handful were taken to trial.
﻿Lawyers were forced to plead guilty on TV.
﻿I refused.
﻿So they shamelessly imprisoned me for a long time.
﻿I told you,
﻿it's for your own good.
﻿You are a lawyer, you should know better.
﻿you just need to handle it well.
﻿Who are you :
﻿Can't we volunteers ask you to provide identification?
﻿But did you register when you came in
﻿I scanned the code.
﻿It divides every community into grids
﻿and assigns an officer to each one.
﻿\Ne manage all kinds of residential matters and complaints.
﻿Where have you been?
﻿I was taking out the trash.
﻿- There are special residents we keep an eye on.
﻿Hi Auntie. I work for the commun
﻿The one with the charging cord?
﻿\Ne are given a watch list by a higher level of government.
﻿are put on the list.
﻿It causes us a lot of stress.
﻿The development of technologies, like facial recognition.
﻿will make our work easier.
﻿To resolve conflicts at the grassroots level,
﻿we rely on the nation's 4.5 million grid officers.
﻿The "Sharp Eyes Project" is another essential national project
﻿With upgraded TV cable,
﻿China's Sky net Project is the world's largest video surveillance network
﻿Last week, the police told me they saw my article.
﻿They said. "The way it's written feels like you."
﻿In 2019.1 witnessed and wrote articles about
﻿because of my reporting.
﻿S® even if I wear ajnask,
﻿When I talk in public, if the big data system is in place,
﻿they can identify me by my voice.
﻿Hello!
﻿We are by no means violent.
﻿Even in countries like the US,
﻿subversion of state power is prosecuted.
﻿But in China there's no clear legal definition of it,
﻿the police manipulate its definition.
﻿My plan now is to petition to government branches in Beijing.
﻿Will that be a problem?
﻿It's legal and logical.
﻿But your personal safety cannot be guaranteed.
﻿The authorities have no shame.
﻿^They can easily escort me back to my hometown and lock me up.
﻿But I still want to try. How will I know if I don't?
﻿-- Our son was only two-and-a-half years old when his father was arrested.
﻿Before that, I was a housewife.
﻿I felt like the sky was falling.
﻿That was a turning point for me.
﻿I became very close with other wives
﻿victimised by the 709 Crackdown.
﻿Quanzhang Wang!
﻿and figure out how to find my husband.
﻿No attorney-client meeting for Quanzhang Wang.
﻿Which department gave this order?
﻿- Doesn't specify. - Doesn't specify?
﻿Quanzhang Wang has disappeared since 987 days.
﻿This is our 27th attempt at filing a mandate.
﻿We try to hold out. We won't give up.
﻿We're fighting for you too!
﻿What are you doing?!
﻿Do you want your children to live a life without freedom too?!
﻿Do you think your comfortable life will be guaranteed forever?
﻿We're also fighting for you!
﻿What are you doing?
﻿Let us out.
﻿Did you hear that?
﻿We are here to petition.
﻿Why are you illegally detaining us?
﻿You need to follow the law.
﻿This camera is to watch my mum.
﻿I'm not opening the door.
﻿'m your friend.
﻿What are you doing?
﻿They're my guests.
﻿Why are you hitting them! Bastards! Stop!
﻿The police are beating people!
﻿You are polluting the whole community.
﻿I'm sorry.
﻿A lot of people said they cried when they saw the video of my return.
﻿I didn't feel anything.
﻿When I was in secret detention.
﻿During that time,
﻿the word that most frequently comes to mind...
﻿...is "report".
﻿"Report, I need to raise my hand."
﻿"Report, I need to blink."
﻿"Report, I need to eat."
﻿No approval.
﻿At one point,
﻿was lying in bed like a dead body.
﻿If I moved even a little bit,
﻿would get punished.
﻿This is Fengxian County.
﻿I'm Zijuan Chen, wife of Chinese human rights lawyer Weiping Chang.
﻿"Free my dad."
﻿Sure, either Chinese or English is okay.
﻿- Don't hold it like a memorial portrait! - I'm not!
﻿Stop wasting time! I'm getting angry.
﻿Fine!
﻿I'm going to get mad.
﻿In some dark places.
﻿I think Weiping Chang is like these fireflies.
﻿Release my dad!
﻿Let's try again.
﻿Don't break it!
﻿I won't!
﻿I'm very anxious.
﻿full of danger.
﻿People who stand up are targeted, right?
﻿But if nobody comes forward, things will never change.
﻿That's why I can totally relate to Weiping Chang.
﻿They tried that a few times.
﻿Apart from that.
﻿they forced me to drink alcohol.
﻿- Alcohol? - To get me drunk.
﻿They wanted me to sign away my rights while drunk.
﻿Now, they take a more individualised approach.
﻿They use big data against you.
﻿One of them said, "I know your period is close."
﻿"I cooked this broth for you. Drink it while it's still warm."
﻿And later, "Let me warm it up for you.
﻿In that situation, even though I knew they had an agenda.
﻿-1 couldn't help feeling... - Moved.
﻿-Not yet 1 - Hurry up, we need to go
﻿Let's go. let's go!
﻿- Bye. Don't forget your laptop. - And face mask.
﻿- What's wrong? - Somebody's outside.
﻿Let's go.
﻿- You can't leave. - Why not?
﻿We can't tell you.
﻿- Who are you? - You don't need to know that.
﻿You're being ridiculous!
﻿Don't overreact.
﻿You asked me to give you my child.
﻿Would you hand your child over to a stranger?
﻿Someone will come and answer your questions.
﻿I don't know you. When did you see me?
﻿I accompanied him to his physical exam.
﻿but there isn't any danger.
﻿Foreign embassies have invited us to participate in events for Human Rights Day.
﻿Police restricting our freedom without legal excuse is a violation of human rights.
﻿After I was arrested.
﻿On days they consider to be politically sensitive,
﻿that it seems almost normal.
﻿But no...
﻿We need to break this pattern using the law.
﻿My way is to cook delicious food for you all.
﻿I can do something as well.
﻿I plan to file formal administrative complaints.
﻿But I have to take care of myself first.
﻿Lawyer Quanzhang Wang, can you hear me?
﻿can hear you.
﻿At the same time.
﻿People like lawyer Jiaxi Ding, Dr. Zhiyong Xu and lawyer Weiping Chang.
﻿means living a comfortable life.
﻿Generations of control.
﻿have made people internalise censorship,
﻿just like the media.
﻿we give in, they take more...
﻿"I will uphold the Party's programme,
﻿observe the provisions of the Party Constitution.
﻿and never betray the Party."
﻿They will never say. "that's enough."
﻿Volunteer activities are registered in the Rongcheng Community app.
﻿Like night patrols, home cleaning, recycling, and many other activities.
﻿On this app, there is also a ranking system.
﻿If they don't, remind them.
﻿Please keep an eye out for improper parking and notify the owners.
﻿cooking for the elderly.
﻿Over the past two days, I spent ten hours volunteering.
﻿Volunteering for ten hours gets you two points.
﻿We need to thank the Party
﻿and be grateful to live in this country.
﻿showing remorse, and studying moral lessons
﻿can individuals repair their damaged social credit score.
﻿Take myself as an example.
﻿and they defaulted on it,
﻿It can also limit travel by high-speed trains or by plane.
﻿If you're a Party member and want to get promoted
﻿you don't stand a chance.
﻿There's no doubt about that.
﻿Rongcheng City has developed
﻿The public seems to accept and participate in these programs *
﻿We sent each major officer a petition letter.
﻿But did those letters help?
﻿we didn't get any responses though.
﻿There's nothing better I can do.
﻿Hello everyone, I am Zijuan Chen.
﻿We wrote a total of 52 petition letters this weekend.
﻿Really?
﻿The oranges are sweet... It's getting cold...
﻿Let's see how long it takes them to delete this post.
﻿"Video uploaded".
﻿The houses all look the same.
﻿Yes. that's the typical style here.
﻿This is Chang's parents' house.
﻿Hello!
﻿You're back!
﻿Yes. I just got back!
﻿Now, I have a camera pointing at my house.
﻿The more I think about it, the more upset I get.
﻿It's dried.
﻿I'll make you want to die rather than live!
﻿I'll make you jump into a river!
﻿If it gets worse, your son may have trouble going to school, too.
﻿You have a long road ahead.
﻿Weiping's case will last for years.
﻿Even before the 709 Crackdown, police often came to my house
﻿He was depressed.
﻿We can continue to file for mandate...
﻿Who is that?
﻿Who is that?
﻿Nobody.
﻿No one?
﻿Oh. it's you. Jong-an.
﻿What are you doing here?
﻿How did you know we were here? Nobody's been home for months.
﻿I was thinking...
﻿No.
﻿stop by later? If you get a chance...
﻿In the future.
﻿fare evasion, soliciting, eating and drinking on the subway,
﻿Smart Neighbourhood,
﻿Smart Logistics,
﻿Smart Dining.
﻿Smart Life.
﻿She came by out of the blue.
﻿Someone must have sent her to check on us.
﻿but after the protest.
﻿This is the Communist Party warning us.
﻿We should rethink our behaviour.
﻿You asked me to protest, I did.
﻿or put him in more danger.
﻿Just because of some surveillance cameras,
﻿you chicken out?
﻿You immediately give up!
﻿Don't blame everything on me!
﻿You said you are a Party member, so you won't protest!
﻿Yes. I said that!
﻿You are a Communist Party member for life.
﻿To be honest. I'm scared.
﻿You are a Communist Party member. Go ahead and be loyal.
﻿Hello, Kitten Wang.
﻿You hid your treat there?
﻿Can't reach it?
﻿How do you write the character "all"?
﻿That pen is mine.
﻿So...what if I borrow it?
﻿Your teacher would tell you the same thing.
﻿My teacher has never said that.
﻿How can I even look it up
﻿You've got your dictionary?
﻿Yes.
﻿You know how to pronounce it,
﻿Everything you do is annoying.
﻿Okay, if you find it annoying.
﻿I won't say anything.
﻿When I was arrested,
﻿Whenever I argue with him,
﻿he says things like. "Go back to prison."

THE PEASANTS
Hanka! Come here to us!
Oh yes!
No!
Just like mine! Yeah!
Pestilated scumbags! Their own kids!
Come Jaguś!
Not only beautiful but also so talented.
Such a girl could marry a rich widower.
I will not raise other people's children!
For this burial, I will not be calling.
Daddy! Red-and-White is dying!
Jambroży has bled it in vain...
Melted wax down her throat— in vain, too...
Scumbags, they killed my cattle...
Leave her alone! You're scaring my wife.
I ain't no butcher.
Come on, Antoś.
But don't tell me what to do.
Indeed, without a housewife at home...
it flows... Like through a sieve.
Well! Eat, eat!
Listen Boryna...
it's bursting like in a furnace.
Zośka, for example..
Mumbler and shrew and one hip is fatter!
So maybe Stach's Weronika?
Yesterday Adam of Rochs sent in with vodka.
Jagna Dominikowa?
Idyllic girl...
- Jagna? - Yeah.
Come on.
Miss Organist...
Mr. Jasio is already taking off to school?
I see you brought herbs?
So many blessings still spoken of her
Mommy says you don't have to.
Not at all! Wait, child.
Take the little stork!
I will heal him by the spring.
Jaguś, take him.
I see you're plotting something here!
Jantoś! Just don't tell daddy, please...
And you know, Jaguś?
He still begrudges us our right to pasture!
Only...
And maybe he does!
Indeed landlord, indeed.
Potatoes! Cheap potatoes!
Three kopecks.
Laced boots, red, black,
for greasing with melted lard.
Three papers.
I don't think so!
Jaguś!
Pure silk...
There's no rush...
I said seven!
Then do it!
Then at least pay the debt for those two acres.
Enough!
Yeah, sure!
And send it, am I against you?
Indeed! You'll help... Jambroży!
Come over here, drink with us!
What's on your mind, Jaguś?
Nothing.
The little stork is healing?
And fly away into the world beyond them.
I would fly with you.
<i>There were two people there...</i>
<i>And so they managed that the child...</i>
Be quiet!
<i>...that they will have a child.</i>
<i>That they will have a child.</i>
If you meet Antek, tell him to hurry up!
Come on!
Damn it!
Jaguś!
One, two, three!
Thanks Antek! God bless you! Jaguś?
Now that's just darkness, huh?
I will.
Ala and Waluś got engaged yesterday!
I saw the ribbons she chose at the fair.
He'll be surprised!
Jagustynka never has a good word for anyone.
But I'm telling the truth!
Indeed he's skilled.
Łukasz! Play something!
Well, my ladies!
Jagusia, bread with meat filling.
For you and for you.
I don't like the taste of vodka.
And for you, Jagustynko.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Bravo!
Bravo musicians!
But you haven't even eaten anything.
Mommy is waiting for me. Godspeed.
That's me!
The first of all to fly.
No... He's quite like you.
And didn't crush some beautiful... girl.
And there you are.
No...
which awakens everything to life.
Yes? Please!
I'm listening.
Jagna will surely leave your house for her own.
Who?
Who but Boryna himself!
Old widower!
Old, and but now he was accused!
I know...
How could it be!
Come, here's to you, mother!
Maciej promised a settlement for Jagna.
I... the mayor, I'm telling you this!
Yeah...
We'll think about it.
Drink up.
Drink Jaguś!
- Jagna! - Leave her alone, mother.
Mommy wants to sell you.
Like a heifer at the fair!
Jaguś...
And you, give her six as well.
How...
Well, of course she is!
Fear God, six acres is a lot of field!
You can sow your seeds now!
Cheers!
Hey, musicians! Play!
Jagusia!
You'll be happy with me!
You're with my father.
I only support order.
But from mine, damn it, from mine!
You could take it too.
And I'm a thief?
I see Antek,
so you're feeling moody now...
Let go! Antek!
Let go!
And he sat down and howled...
Do you ever shut your mouth?
Cheers!
Cheers!
You've bequeathed Jagna a whole six acres!
When everything is yours you will bequeath it!
And whose is this?
- Ours. - You're stupid! The ground is mine.
And I will do with it as I please!
If it hurts you, then look for something better!
For Antek, Magda and Józka.
You see her, she will share mine here!
We only want justice.
He gave her six whole acres...
For whom? For this pig?
The whole world even!
Landlord, stop it!
Antek, enough!
Just a bitch!
Why you so gloomy?
Look.
God did not create you for poverty, no!
Love comes and goes, but land remains.
Don't give me away,
...from thyself.
Don't give me away,
...from thyself.
Leave me alone!
Look at her, the heiress!
She's concerned!
He'll be right there.
Cheers!
We will claim ours.
Livelier!
Today is your wedding,
Oh, Jagusia, my beauty!
Drink, young one!
Cheers to the lady!

Do you know that they're looking

So maybe... I could get a job there?
Don't talk, daddy!
I won't work in Lipce!

He can even jump around her,
but Jagusia will go back
to her old habits anyway...
No, no way...
I heard him whining at her door,
that she had to shoo him away with a broom.
She complained about him more than once.
You're not the first and
You're lying!
You're lying, you scumbag!
Hey, guys! Stop it!
Antek!
- Beautiful! - Oh, not really!
I'll bring more wood!
Welcome Jasiu!
Very beautiful!
Really!
Antek looked thin when I
passed by him... Clearly struggling.
He struggled a lot...
when he was breaking Mateusz's ribs.

Goodbye Jasiu!
Well, about you.
You're lying like a dog!

And Antek almost killed him.
Well, don't worry, darling, don't worry.

Have you seen Maciej, what we
mother's hat serves you well.
It suits you.
Let's go.
Jaguś, come to the floodplains one day.
Will you undo it?
You have shamed me before the world,
were already calling for a priest
And that thing you were saying
Why, I wouldn't dare speak thus to Jagusia!
Oh, greetings, good host!
Greetings!
Greetings. Praised be Jesus Christ.
Come Jaguś. This way.
I can this?
Did I not myself pursue Jagna?
But thou were dearer to her.
The heir had no right!
and Lipce always had rights there!
The forest is his.
But we shall seek an accord.
They'll mark it and soon it will be chopped.
Every day I await...
Volta, lads!
And sharply!
I only...
I only danced...
He shall be crying...
I only danced!
Move faster!
Stupid,
You're decorating the hut
Once I rise, I swear, you'll regret it!
Silence, Jagna!
Go and see if Józka needs some help.
It's not her fault.
Then whose?
For you left her alone
The music played, and all were merry,
they danced, so what?
Just tend to me so I recover swiftly,
and spare me the lessons in wisdom.
I know exactly how it was.

For God's sake, Hanka!
Look upon me on any day,

When I fell to poverty,

He himself called me,
I need nothing from him.

Let him choke on his own kindness!
He bought you cheap, with a crust of bread,
like a dog.
Yet cheaper still you sold us and yourself,

Now go, run to your bitch!

Well, that he now seeks vengeance
Because I said it before?
Because I don't come to you,

Like that ill-natured dog, which might bite
it's because of you,
because of my love for you,
You love me? You do nothing but curse me!
What? What? You need someone else now?

They're cutting our woods!
Shall we allow this?

Bring the riders.
Fear nothing, people!
Together we must go!
Follow me, people! To the woods!
Why stand ye idle? Attack!

I thought at this hour
Folks like you don't need to rise at dawn.
With father ill, and Antek and the rest
I thought I'd check
if you needed anything...
Thank you. I'm taking care of
everything, as father commanded.
Four eyes can see more than two.
I'll wait until Jagna wakes up.
Wait if you like.
Get out Hanka!
Quiet, there's a sick man here!
you little lady!
The whole farm would fall apart,
And finally feed that moaning cow of yours.
Didn't father speak of anything?
Oh Jesus. Michał!
No.
Probably hidden in the pantry.
We'll split the money fairly,
before Hanka steals it all.
Just bring the key, Jaguś...
Doing chores, Jaguś?
Surely it would be better for you,
if they released Antek, right?
I could arrange something.
I have connections.
Come...
Sit with me, we'll work something out.
Don't be mad, Jaguś,
I'm on your side after all.
And I'll help with Antek!
A! Hanka!
Why are you yelling?
You hung this over my bed!
It was the only place.
Just you try, bitch,
I'll fix your pretty little face
so not even your own
Hanka!
Hanka...
Throw them out...
Father! My God! Does it hurt, father?
Throw everyone out!
in the straw barrel...
you'll find some money...
Don't let him... yours...
Yours...
You said you could help Antek.
We'll calmly figure everything out.
Come Jaguś, come.
Come here Jaguś, come on...
Tell them! They'll believe you now!
Per eúndem Dóminum nostrum...
Amen!
A joyous day has dawned upon us,
One that each of us desired.
Landlord!
Time to sow...
God, giver of forgiveness
and lover of human salvation,
we beg of thy mercy,
through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.
Come to me.
Tell me what's new, Hanka.
Everything's as before, urgent work awaits.
As before?
You took father's money!
What you stole, is yours.
But we will make divisions.
I'm just guarding my husband's property
Since father died, Antek is now the head of

Look at him! Found himself an honest man.
You're just scheming,
how to nibble at these lands!
Poor orphan...
Holding six acres of our best land!
You're right, Hanka,
let's wait for Antek to return.
I'd rather break my legs, than have entered this house!
your own misdeeds in your face!
What have I done so wrong?
You chased after him like a desperate bitch,
How he begged just to see a bit of my skirt!
just don't regret it later.
If I want, even if you kiss his feet,
Don't let Antek turn away from us again...
even to death if you must!
Jagna!
Don't touch me!
You had something to tell me, so speak up.
You left me just as I am, and here I remain.
I never left you!
I thought of you day and night.
Had something else on your mind?
I did.
I remembered how you humiliated me.
I humiliated you?
Surely, I also forced you
to sleep with the Mayor, right?
Jaguś...
Antek, no!
<i>An owl perches in the grove</i>

SUMMER
But such dryness!
You were worried, huh?
And why not?
The mistress, for two sacks.
Hanka?
Now just drive Józka out,
and everything will be yours.
She's barely a widow!
I'm just saying that Hanka
Jagna was on her own land!
filed a complaint in court?
Jagna back to that land.
We'll see.
Jaguś...
Let them bark!
The heat's on, so they're drunk
with anger and mouthing off.
You know...
Not all men are the same.
Maybe it would help...
in the village,
if you married someone.
I've had enough of what they bring.
Jaguś? Dear child!
Wasn't that Jesus' profession?
Sure, he has his past,
but you have yours too!
Don't talk like that!
people will forgive you.
- I won't confess. - Fear God, child!
Praised be Jesus Christ.
Praised be, Hanka.
I'm going to Częstochowa, forgive me
please forgive me.
I'll pray for you.
Jagna?
As if you don't recognize me, Jagusia?
so different...
- And Jagusia? - Just wandering about...
Pious?
No, about distant lands and seas.
Jesus! About the seas!
Look here.
Look here.
See this pyramid?
churches on top of each other,
when I was at your place for Christmas.
At no holiday market
in Warsaw are there such beautiful...
I should go.
Surely, I interrupted your prayers, didn't I?
Goodbye.
Indeed, a suitable place,
Something stirred in me, and I went to look

I'm just repeating what people say.
and I'll set things straight.
Hey!
The community chest is missing 5,000,
they're taking everything now,
the Lipce have to pay extra.
Folks!
On Jagna!
Balderdash! Pray for us!
How would I know?
have a harlot in the family?
Do something!
She's bewitched my boy.
For her, he'd buy anything she desired.
Everyone saw it.
And where does she get her clothes?
She was Boryna's wife!
Got all her rags from him.
And what's it to you?
Mother of God!
from her and told me everything!
leave the priest in peace?
And look at this crop failure...
divine punishment upon the village.
It's time to end this!
There's only one solution! Exile!
Certainly, that's the way!
It must be done.
must be banished from the village.
Speak your part, Antoni.
Come on Antoni, everyone's listening!
Since your father passed away,
We can't make decisions without you.
I live in the community,
on the altar, do so!
Antek!
Do you know what they'll do to Jagusia?
Curse them with such law!
Will you oppose the whole community?
You speak as if you're with them.
I'm with no one,
as for this stone.
Jesus...
that you dare...
Antek!
Your word... it means something.
Too late...
Mother! The whole village
is coming for her!
Come on, lock up!
Hide!
I won't hide from anyone.
Take this, take it!
And one, two, three!
Jagna! Jagna!
People! People! Step back...
Leave Jagna alone!
Back off, mother!
Mommy!
Come here!
You'll pay for everything!
Oh, you'll pay, you scoundrel!
And now, you wretch!
In that painted face!
Gave kisses? Now gorge yourself on shame!
like we've stuffed ourselves!
May the holy earth spit you out!
Get out of the village, you vermin!
Into the muck!
Bind her!
Enough!

Nah.

but someone's gotta be an adult around here.
- Well, maybe you could use some help.
- Finding 30 grand?
- I mean, you can't do everything by yourself, Sue.
- Not everybody experiences a happy family, Donna,
so not everyone's
in a rush to make one. - Well,
maybe history doesn't have to repeat itself.
It doesn't.
Look, just 'cause your mom ran out
does not mean- - Okay.
That you have to- - Right.
- And I'm not,
I'm just selling myself some reality.
- Yeah.
Not like this is where I imagine myself,
but it's not like I've even have a choice.
Look at the fucking mess that we're in right now.
- Well, hey, Sue.
- Mark.
- Donna.
Hey, how are you?
- Good.
- Just finished my grad program.
- Congratulations.
Yeah, Dad's been talking about retirement,
- No one leaves this place forever.
Okay, I gotta go, so...
call me later.
- Maybe.
- Good seeing you, Mark.
Yeah.
Bye.
- Yeah.
A lot's changed around here,
but, look, not to be rude or anything,
but we're not really open.
I just,
- Hey, look, I really-
- No?
Wait, hold on, what?
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, just a little on gas.
And a drink.
- There's a sign back there that said
No, I'm good.
- Suit yourself.
I'm free as a bird!
Ow!
Swing by?
- Hello, gorgeous.
I'll have one beer and one shot of you.
- I think you've had enough.
- Not even close.
- Get it together or get the fuck out.
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.
One drink, get that gas,
and get the hell out of here.
Oh, excuse me, sir, my apologies.
Hey, ma'am.
The sign up front says that you sell gas.
- Pump's out back.
Just pull your boat up.
- The store in town does just four miles that way.
- Yeah, that's great.
Perfect.
Okay.
- And for you?
- Woo!
- No, have you?
- Hey.
Can we use your shower later?
Free as a bird.
Girl! - Woo!
- That's 170.
175.
70.
Shit.
20.
40.
- Still chasing that dollar, Gary Parker?
- Fuck me, man, I'm trying to get your money, all right?
- Yeah.
but you're stubborn.
- Come on, bubba, everything's for sale.
I thought all good trailer trash knew that.
Fuck off.
down the Shreveport last night.
- Oh yeah?
Well, swear to God,
guess who it was, none other than your ex-wife, Gary Parker.
- Gina?
- Yeah.
- You saw Gina? - Yeah.
- What casino?
- What casino?
What casino?
Cock
sucker!
You cock sucker!
God
damn it!
- See you found a can.
- Yeah, yeah.
I...
met a guy.
Or was it those girls?
- Look, I...
- You really took my room tonight.
How much you make?
- Not yet.
How much?
Maybe.
- I just take what I need when I need it.
- I don't really believe in taking things that aren't yours,
Something bigger.
- Well, are you tellin' or showin'?
- Maybe both.
But I would need something in return.
30 grand...
by Monday.
- Oh.
If I showed you where,
- By Monday?
That's kind of a steep turnaround.
my family is gonna lose this land.
I don't really know where we'd live.
- These pockets, how deep are they?
- I get you your 30,
I keep the rest.
- Take all you want.
- Hell.
All right, if I do this,
I don't know this area, not well, that is...
but there is a buyer I can call.
I'm Dion.
- Sue.
- Well, we best start tonight, Sue.
- Q-92.
The Festival of Lights, now days away.
day and night-- - One of my regulars,
he's got a barn filled of like old cars, the classics.
- Okay.
I know a bunch of construction sites.
We could get some of the equipment.
- Got a trailer, something to pull it?
- My truck can.
Hey,
what's this place?
- Just some bar that's open later than us.
It's filled with rednecks.
- Jackpot.
You thirsty?
- No.
- Three days come quick, honey.
- Oh, not true.
There's a few welding trucks outside too.
- So?
- So, what it means is they got more money
You shoot pool?
- Of course, I'm a bartender.
Okay?
Go win us some money, honey.
- Who's next?
Thank you, much.
- Pure enter-fucking-tainment.
- Damn, baby, that's some good shooting.
What's your name?
- Hey. - You weren't kidding.
- Hey, Sue!
Where you been? - Hey, let's just go.
- Yeah.
Sorry, my phone's dead.
that football guy at the bar, but damn,
you kind of a whore, ain't you?
What?
Oh, motherfucker.
- Speak to women like that, huh?
- No, sir.
- Hey.
Come on.
- Go, go, go.
I should have probably bet that game.
- Yeah.
- I'd save all that feeling bad stuff for Tuesday,
we're on a deadline.
What's next?
- How do I reach you?
- I'll find you.
- Okay.
I appreciate you doing this.
- Yeah.
- Hey, that river, what's it run into?
It's just damned at both ends.
- Goodnight.
Yeah, exactly.
- All right.
- Hey, Dad, you got a sec?
Swing by the bank and pick up your mom for lunch.
Hey, how do you like that company truck?
- It's great.
Thank you, Dad. - Yeah, yeah.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, shoot.
- Well, yeah, I shot an offer to Gary a while back,
Drunk bastard.
- So who's gonna run it, you?
- Well, maybe, what's it to you?
- I just never knew you dreamed of owning a bar.
What's Sue gonna do for money?
- Ah, hold on.
Please don't tell me you're going after that girl again.
- She's just a friend.
- Yeah, a friend who'll get knocked up
- It's not like that.
- That's bullshit.
You know what, I made you, I know how you think.
- Dad, I'm a grown man, I can-
- I'll show you a grown man, huh?
Now you listen to me,
and listen right this time.
that's your future.
All right?
Okay, so if you want to chase after trash
you go ahead but I'm not paying for no wedding.
You're not taking this company ever.
- I didn't ask you to pay for nothing, Dad.
- Yeah.
- See the hardware store's under new ownership?
- Depends on today.
Hey,
Jacob, can you go do your homework?
- Got something in the making,
hopefully.
- I wish me and Brad could help.
- I wouldn't even take the money if you guys offered it.
- Any sign from your dad?
- Okay.
Sure.
Yes.
- You got those addresses?
See you after work.
- Um, excuse me,
- That is something in the making.
- Well, I hope it's babies you're making, 'cause, damn,
I'd feed him crackers in my sheets.
- You don't already do that with Brad?
- He needs a bib more than my baby.
Oh shit, he looks bad.
I'll take him.
- Hey, buddy, you're gonna go with Donna, okay?
She's gonna take you home.
- Oh, right.
Your game is Saturday, right?
Okay, Donna, do you mind?
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.
- That motherfucker!
Goddamn it!
- Put what?
- Don't you fuck with me!
- Fucker!
- You fucking better not have!
- I'm sorry.
- Goddamn it!
Motherfucking goddamn it.
Shit.
Don't believe you did this.
- Can't believe this is the example
you're trying to set for your son.
- Shit!
- Look at yourself, Gary, this is pathetic.
- You'll learn one day, little girl,
I'm doing the best I can,
Motherfucker!
when you can't even save yourself?
- I got 6,500 yesterday.
- Bullshit!
Who'd you screw?
- You watch your fucking mouth!
- Yeah.
- Been running it since Mom left you.
- Yeah, and you think you know everything just like her!
- No, actually, I don't,
because I used to think that Mom was a cunt for leaving you,
but now.
- That is fucked up!
I tell you what,
I tell you what, you get the money,
the place is yours.
- Put that in writing.
- You give me a fucking pen, smartass!
- Okay.
It's unstuck.
- Thank you, gorgeous.
- Last call, everyone.
Shit, what happened to your face?
- Nothing.
Can I get a drink?
- Yes, still a whiskey?
- Please.
- Oh God, I don't have change for that.
standing where you are.
- Does he know we spoke?
- Hey, yeah, it's stuck again.
- Shit.
Can you just play darts until then?
- Yeah, no worries.
Oh, I got you.
Wait.
Oh, snap, yo.
Yo, you're Mark Roy.
- Who's asking?
- Logan?
Logan Thibadeaux.
You played at St. Mary's.
- Wide receiver from Evangel.
- Yeah. - Yeah, I remember you.
- Talk to me, that's right.
- I just graduated from Princeton.
- Princeton.
Nice.
Okay.
She's the best piece you'll find.
- Is that right?
- Oh man, what?
So good.
I hit her once and now she want me
- Yeah.
Should have heard her lungs.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Hey, break it up!
Get out, both of you!
Bar is closed!
That's enough!
Stop it, now get out!
We are closed!
- See, what I tell you, boy?
- Get your ass out!
Keep walking, bitch! - Stop it!
Go home or I will call the cops!
Go!
Get out!
- Everybody out!
Now!
- Yeah.
- This is a collect call
from Caddo Parish Corrections Center from-
- Accept, yeah.
Accept.
Baby? - Gary?
- Hey.
- Please tell me you got something.
- Thank you, Jesus.
What?
- Nevermind.
- Since you wanna ask questions,
- Didn't choose it.
- It means we should focus.
Come on.
Hey.
- This is Daryl Roy's house.
- Okay.
Now, look,
when I call you, you answer this, all right?
Stay low.
If a light comes on,
flash this once.
If the door opens,
All right?
- What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
Hey.
Hey, I just saw a light come on.
- Okay, stay low.
I'll be at the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?
- You just be ready to jump.
- What?
Hello?
Fuck.
- This is insane!
- Woo!
Go.
- Woo!
Get down, stay low.
- Who's driving?
- My friend, Jack.
- Who's Jack?
- Don't worry.
- Caddo Police Department.
- Yeah.
I'm calling about Gina Parker.
Sir?
- Okay.
Let me handle this, all right?
- Okay.
- Hey.
- So good to see you.
- Yeah, Jack, this is Sue.
- You're Jack? - Jacqueline.
Only friends call me Jack.
- I appreciate you doing this.
- That's a 2015.
I'll give you 15 for it.
- What?
No, it's worth double that.
- Excuse you?
- This is not a Kingfisher,
this is a Mastercraft. - Sue,
let me handle this.
Adding one more to that list ain't nothing to me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's in a money bind.
- What are you, stupid?
Bringing a date on a job?
Okay, gotta be able to work something out.
- No.
All right, and you're lucky you're getting that.
Summer's over.
You're right, thank you.
- You know me.
- Too pretty to go to jail.
Y'all be careful now.
- I'm sorry.
- This isn't the bar business, Sue.
- Okay, well,
seemed like there was a little history there.
What'd she mean by past sins?
Do you think this is fun for me?
Huh?
God.
Shit.
- Just be honest.
Do you kill people too?
- Sue, I promise you, I don't.
He was a drunk fuck.
me and my mom so bad and we couldn't even leave the house.
and she finally called the cops, he was busted.
And she bought that Chevelle off some meth head
and we split town.
It took him about five years to get out,
Yeah, so I've...
I didn't kill nobody for money.
Just him.
Just that once.
So when I say I didn't choose this life...
I don't know, wanted men don't have many options.
- I'm sorry.
carrying the sins or mistakes of others.
and if it weren't for Jacob, I...
- Yeah, we don't get to choose our family, do we?
- No.
- Jeb.
Wake up.
- Yeah.
- You gotta be shittin' me.
Motherfucker!
- Where you going?
- We got it back here.
I'll make you some.
- Okay.
- What?
- It's not here.
- We're gonna need that gun.
- Boy.
We'll find out who.
Yeah, let me call you back.
Somebody stole Daryl's boat right off his dock last night.
- You're kidding.
You know who did it?
- Well, no,
- Who?
- Who do you fucking think?
He is on camera holding a gun,
standing on my fucking property.
you get to him before I do.
- Gary Parker came by the house last night.
Stumbling drunk.
- It's just ancient history.
Really.
Mom.
- I know he don't look it now
but Gary and I had a little thing in high school.
- So that was true.
I thought it was just small town bullshit.
- Well, we don't talk about it.
- Okay, so that was 30 years ago,
and now Dad's just gonna buy the Parker's bar out of spite?
- For my good, what is?
- Your father thinks that
- Then I won't pursue anything with Sue.
We just--
Since I've been back,
Mom, have either of you spoken to Sue?
Unbelievable.
- Mark.
Wait, no, Mark, come back, let's talk.
Where are you going?
- I quit my fucking job!
- Gary!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!
went ahead and paid the debt?
- Highly doubt that.
- You don't need that if the door is unlocked.
so I can get the hell out of here.
- Okay, just stop.
Let's just take breath.
- I don't need to breathe.
We probably can't get that much money in a day anyway.
You're the one who runs.
You're fucking mistaken if you think I need you.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Are you going?
Fuck.
- What the hell?
- Just answer me.
I didn't need your help at Princeton
and I don't need it now.
- Yeah.
Yep, 1462.
Yeah, hurry up.
My fucking boat.
- Hey, hold on, hold on.
Look who's here.
Huh, look who's home.
You're a woman now.
So pretty and...
- Come on, I know you're starving, baby, come on.
Come on, baby.
Let's go inside.
That's my girl.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Hold, hold on, now.
Here.
I got you a little something.
- Gary?
- Yeah?
Oh, hey, baby girl.
What, you going hunting or something?
Hey, check them hog traps, would you?
Here, have some potted meat on them saltines again.
- What money?
- Last chance.
I'm just speeding up the process.
- Sue, baby,
I used it to post her bail.
Jail?
- She's home now.
What else matters?
- You took the money that I got to save your fucking ass
and you used it to save hers?
- Jesus, calm down, would you?
Come on.
Fuck.
You on your period or something?
- Sue, baby.
- Ow.
Oh.
- We're done with easy.
Fucking shit.
Goddamn it.
Oh, shit.
and no home?
Now Jeb Roy is gonna take the only home
that we have ever known.
If he doesn't bulldoze it down first.
- Baby girl,
our family's back together.
What the fuck?
Gina?
Hey.
Gina, what are you doing?
- Hey!
Hey, where you going, Gina?
What are you doing?
Where you going?
Don't do this to me!
You keep doing this to me, shit!
Goddamn it.
Oh, fucker.
Goddamn it.
Damn it.
Shit.
Because it is the same bullshit
you two have been putting me through for years!
- No, I said no more easy.
Now get up.
Get up!
- Hey!
Goddamn it.
- Fuck!
- Howdy.
Hey now.
You lost?
No, sir.
Just getting to my car.
Just haven't seen you around here before.
- Well, I'm just visiting, got family here.
Cousin of mine plays football for the college
but we're from Texas.
- Oh, that's nice.
What is this?
'69?
- '70.
- Damn, hey, boy,
- Shit.
- Yep.
- Actually,
maybe.
Ran off this morning and forgot my glasses.
You think you could help me read this?
- Well.
And it looks like you bought some spray paint.
Where's my fucking boat?
- I could show you.
Get out.
- Hey.
- I'm leaving town, Sue.
Look, I apologize for the other night.
That guy was saying something about you.
- Look, that's why I'm leaving.
- Okay.
Where are you going?
- Okay,
that's great.
But what happened to staying here
And if I'm being honest,
We didn't choose to end things, Sue, it was chosen for us.
- I hear voices!
Hey!
Yeah, sorry.
- Let me out!
- Rehab's expensive.
- If I don't do this now, I may never get the chance.
Come with me.
or telling us how to live our lives.
why didn't you ask me then?
I would've hopped in your truck in a heartbeat
but now I can't leave.
What about Jacob?
After eight years,
I would still marry you tomorrow, Sue.
- You would wanna marry this?
Hey.
Hey, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
- No.
Really, it's not.
Look.
- They showed up at school today.
Mom was with him.
She looked bad.
Security made him leave.
That is so...
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
she's already gone, okay?
- Yeah.
- I've never seen Dad smile so big.
- Yeah, well...
- Dad?
- Jacob.
My boy.
Hey.
- Oh.
Thank you, buddy.
Hey.
Help me out here, would you?
Just...
run over to my toolbox.
and grab that needle nose.
You know them little needle nose?
Help me, help me snip. help me snip these.
Right here, okay?
You get me out of here, we'll do whatever you want.
Seriously, you name it.
- Listen.
Hey.
Hey, Jacob, hey!
Hey, Jacob, buddy, hey!
Come on, Jacob.
Hey.
Buddy, I get better inside too.
I get better inside.
I promise.
Come on, Jake.
You're gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Six.
- Okay.
I'll be there, okay?
I heard Tyler's parents talking.
I'm on it, you just think about your game.
- Oh, shit.
- Fucker.
I'll be good.
I'll be good.
I'm gonna be good.
- Man won't ever be rich enough.
like, in writing or anything?
- Not that I ever saw.
I don't think he even got an email.
I mean, you could fight this.
- I'm tired of fighting for him.
Any word from Dion?
- Hey.
- He ain't here and I'm almost done packing up.
- Mark contact you?
- You know what, fuck you and fuck your stuck up wife!
This place is still ours for 48 hours.
Ha, trash.
Trash that comes from garbage!
Tell Gary to meet me out at that auction.
- Smell like shit.
- Yeah.
That's what happens when you piss yourself
- Yeah, well, I've seen you piss yourself
so don't start making excuses now.
- Yeah.
All right.
Look, you made your point, Sue.
The internet says detoxing takes 72 hours
and that's only if we settle some things
- What?
'Cause you can't be trusted.
and only getting paid in tips, so that changes now.
when the bank sent you any notices.
it's over.
- When?
- I...
I don't remember.
- You know, it's okay that you lost hope.
Drink that water.
- Hey, no, honey.
Sue, Sue, please, don't go.
Don't go, please.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
And I promise, I promise that I'll do better.
Just don't leave me in here.
He doesn't even know you sober.
But I do.
that they eat bones and all.
I couldn't even eat bacon after that.
So you better start remembering who that man was
because you got a son that needs a father
and this shit ain't gonna cut it.
The chief of police announced this morning
record breaking attendances this year.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.
They just left.
and I can't really see any.
but if something happens and you get caught
and you give them my name,
- Good girl.
- Yeah.
It's looking like that.
- No surprise there.
Talk soon.
- Okay.
- Q-92, Festival of Lights in full swing.
The crowds are pouring in from everywhere.
I'm told every hotel is full.
- Over here, sweetheart.
- You know, the law says I could shoot you for trespassing.
You packing?
I got a hundred thousand dollars parked outside overnight,
you think I don't have cameras pointed at every inch?
Huh?
Got it on tape, now I'm wondering,
about my brother's boat either, huh?
Oh, hey, look.
Little bit like your mama.
you understand?
and burn it to the ground!
Now you got one more chance.
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
Is he?
Is he?
Oh, shit. - Oh my God.
Fuck, okay, okay, come on.
Come on, hey. - Hey, hey.
Come on.
Go, go.
Okay, come on, come here.
We're gonna stop the bleeding.
Lift your shirt up.
Okay, oh, God.
Okay.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We really need to bury those bodies.
- Bodies?
Like, like plural?
- Both Roys can't go missing.
You hear me?
Think about your brother, Sue.
We got no choice here.
- Can't, I'm just hitting clay.
I can't get any deeper.
Oh God, no. - Yeah,
- Okay.
- I'll try.
- Okay. - Come on.
Come on.
Come on, almost there.
I'm gonna stay, okay?
- Hospitals have cameras.
The whole fucking town does.
- Look, you can stay at my trailer
- Okay.
- Just hang on.
We got this, okay?
Hey.
Donna.
in like five minutes.
Please, I need you to me the biggest favor.
Okay.
Just hang in there, okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
- Shit.
Come here.
- I'll explain later.
- Staggered in, he can barely walk!
Sue, you're really scaring me.
- I'm scared too, I will explain everything.
- Please.
Please, promise me! - Okay, okay!
- Sue.
You okay?
- Oh, don't matter, it's done.
Nobody gonna find them either.
Hey, where's your fella?
- No.
- No?
I got everything under control, okay?
Hmm?
Go on.
We could--
- Please.
- See you later, sweetie.
- Fuck!
And, sure enough, karma came running.
- You got it, boss.
- I guess God forgave me 'cause I bought the bar back
- When Mrs. Roy started searching for Mr. Roy,
of course the cops came to Gary first.
and the perfect witness.
Said they didn't have money for rehab.
- Hey.
Thanks for the ride, Jesse.
I appreciate it, brother. - No problem.
- Listen, come by now.
Come by, you drink something.
Come here, squirrel!
What you doing?
Come here!
Oh man, I missed you.
Oh, boy.
- When the FBI joined the search,
and when nothing was found,
they looked at the bank statements
and that's where the bureau ran across
for embezzling six million dollars from the bank,
the whole town finally knew why the Roys owned everything.
Well, at least they used to.
Mark did what he said he would do
and started his own life in New York.
- Hey, baby girl, show her, show her.
Oh, wait a minute, we got something.
Look at that.
- We got the big pack.
We got the big one! - Yes.
- No, I gotta shower.
- Come on. - Come on.
check the hog traps?
- Yes, I did.
- Okay. - They're empty.
- Good.
- All right.
Let's do these next.
and I'd kill for him,
- Uh-oh, here comes trouble.
She's ready when you are.
- What?
Wait, you're giving me the boot already?
- Uh-huh.
Well,
because I was thinking maybe...
- And then do what?
- Well, for starters...
- Oh!
Okay.
Watch yourself, old man.
- Hey.
I'll show you old man.
- Fire in the hole!
- One.
Two.
One, two, three, four.
I remember...
So I-I understood when you shared that day
I remember I passed you
and you were riding your bicycle up a hill.
I remember thinking...
I'm here.
I came.
You're what I wish I could have been.
except that I wish my mom...
My dear Sylvia,
being your sponsor has been a gift.
I know you don't want to hear this,
so you don't be alone like me.
Anna is going to grow up
- [Sylvia] Yeah. - She will.
definitely nothing would be possible
with-without this group here.
And I'm very grateful for my daughter.
How do you feel being here?
- Good. - [Sylvia] Good?
Yeah.
You guys, congratulations, have a good night.
- Dinner later? Dinner later? - Yeah.
The fridge broke again.
I'll call someone to fix it.
- Thank you, bye. - Bye.
Morning, Karen.
Oh, great! Okay.
- Hey, good morning, everybody. - Good morning.
- [Anthony] Good morning. - Anthony, good morning.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Anthony. - Good morning.
What's up?
And I like eating a-apple sauce.
And I like eating chips.
Okay. I'll carry it down.
Let's go downstairs, you're gonna miss your bus.
Anyone want more?
All fit, all done?
Sorry, I'll take this one.
This one's better.
No more.
All right.
Hey, do you mind if I go on my break?
[Karen] Lucy, wash your hands.
- Sure. - Mark.
- Mark. - What?
- Not now. - It's a picture.
Let's have a nice time.
[whispering] All right, just wait.
That's enough.
- Mark. - Okay.
No.
Here, take my seat.
Mm.
Robert's not going.
I could be your date.
- If you want. - Thank you, sweetie.
and spend time with other people.
How did the anniversary meeting go?
It was nice.
- What anniversary? - Lucy.
Just eat.
It's not Robert's money.
You've become a drug dealer?
[sighs] No, the students pay me in cash.
No, no, thank you.
Mom keeps asking about you and Anna.
She wasn't doing well without dad.
Huh, Anna, we gotta leave.
- Sorry, do you have an aspirin? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
I asked for a repair-woman.
No, come up.
Kitchen's in there.
It's leaking.
- Has it been 15 years? - M-more, I was pregnant.
- Sylvia. - Hi.
Oh, she... No!
- She canceled last minute. - She told me she was...
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to get her number.
- Yes, yes. - I can't wait to see everybody.
- You look amazing. - Thank you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my God!
I'm so glad you're here!

Hi.
- Come here, you. - Hi.
- Have a seat. - Sure.
- Yeah. - Really?
Yeah, I mean...
Yeah, and you couldn't find your way back.
I had to yell.
Did you leave the party alone?
Did you leave the party alone?
No.
No.
- Thank you. - Yeah.
There's something else for you, too.
Okay.
This one's smaller, so...
Oh!
Oh, I see.
Okay.
I-I don't know if you should put Isaac down
for emergency contact.
Okay.
I tried to make it cool.
I'm fine.
Anna said there was a man outside.
He followed me home from the Woodbury event.
He's one of Ben's friends.
Why else would he follow me home?
- What's his name? - Saul Shapiro.
Sure.
Okay.
Hi, Isaac, this is Sylvia from...
Great! Send me your address.
Okay, thanks.
- Hello. - [Sylvia] Hi.
This is my daughter, Sara.
Well, I just looked outside my window one morning.
Thank God Sylvia found him.
[Saul] Hi.
What's wrong with you? Invite her in.
Listen, I apologize
Mm-mm, it's fine.
It's-it's not fine.
Okay.
He has dementia.
Then something like the other night happens
and we're not sure why that is.
It's changed a lot, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
But it was nicer then.
Nobody takes care of it.
Do you remember things that happened a long time ago?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I think about my wife.
My parents.
Holidays and all that stuff.
What about school?
Woodbury.
So did I.
- Really? - Yeah.
Don't you remember me?
No.
Oh, I remember.
You really don't remember me?
No.
Do you remember Ben Goldberg?
Yeah.
I was 12, he was 17.
He liked raping me.
- Ben Goldberg? - Yes, sometimes he was alone.
Sometimes he wasn't.
You remember?
I remember Ben.
No!
You were following me home.
I don't know... [stammering]
I remember the party because Isaac showed me pictures.
- From where? - From the Wo--
From the Woodbury party.
You were at the Woodbury party?
You followed me home from the Woodbury party.
And you sexually abused me when I was 12, and you were 17 or 18.
You like thinking about what you used to make me do?
I don't remember.
You know what?
You deserve being the way you are.
Saul!
Isaac, it's Sylvia.
Please, thank you, bye.
Yes?
Yeah, come up.
- [Sara] Hey. - Hey.
- No. - Cool.
Uh, but I leave today.
And since you and Saul get along
my dad and I were maybe thinking
I'm not a nurse.
All you'd have to do is be there.
No, I don't think so.
Here, um...
I'll-I'll think about it and I'll call your dad.
In cash.
as a gesture of thanks for helping my uncle already.
Try it for a few afternoons.
- [Karen] Hey. - Hey.
[Karen] Hi.
I made the most of it and... cleaned the house.
Yeah, I organized.
I found a joint in your pencil case.
You change your password?
I'm not staying here tonight.
I'm going to Olivia's.
And...
you know, "I wouldn't trade...
What?
Yes, I did.
How do you know that?
That's good.
so they could get a better place to live.
- And-- - We've offered.
It's very sweet.
Saul.
Hi.
Isaac?
It's her.
[Saul] Wanna sit down?
Hi.
[Saul] I thought you couldn't come.
Oh, great, let me just get my stuff for jogging.
- I'm okay. - [Issac] Change of plans.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Great, well, just...
Yes, I'll be right there, okay?
It wasn't you.
You and I hadn't even...
seen each other until...
a few nights ago.
So she just thought it'd be...
You feel like talking about it?
It's...
Okay.
Okay.

For 3.5 million.
Too rich for your blood, huh?
Um, what's that? Atlantic?
Uh-huh.
You're kidding! God! Your turn.
Hi.
Yeah, I think I do, but I might need Ashley's help.
- You forgive me? - Yeah.
Hey, who's up?
I just went.
There you go.
Uh, how can you afford it?
Oh, I got a second job.
Doing what?
I'm, uh...
That's really pretty.
- Yeah. - Then no.
Told you.
There's not gonna be drinks.
No, thank you.
Well, because I'm alcoholic, Lucy.
Sylvia!
But, what if you just had one?
I...
- Since Anna was born. - Hmm.
Okay, this conversation's over.
- Or just drinks? - That's enough! That's enough!
Why? I'm asking her an important question.
Let's play the game.
Did you?
What did I say?
Is there anything you want to do after breakfast?
Whatever you want.
- Okay. - Right at the end.
- I'll pause the film? - No, no, no.
I'll be right back, don't move.
[Sylvia] What happened?
Did he get her number?
I can't rewind it.
Yeah?
It's okay.
Are enjoying the movie?
Yeah.
So you could watch.
- Is it good? - Yeah.
You got it.
Wow! Look at you!
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Ashley. Hi, honey.
WALDEN: Wait.
Wait, ah.
Wait!
ANNIE: Well, aren't you glad I cleaned my mirrors
this morning, Walden?
Yes, Annie.
Very pristine.
along with your counterparts in New York City, Los Angeles,
and Chicago, where I add, the competition is substantial.
Your quest to beat the world record
Open your stenos, please.
You have 60 seconds beginning now.

Hey, Walden.
Well, there's more rounds to go, George.
You forgot your change, George.
You want your usual soda?
Oh, no. Thanks, Daisy.
I'm good.
just pure calories and sugar.
Oh, no.
Thank you, Daisy.
You're welcome.

That's only 17 less.
You won't like today's case.

Very bad man!

It's rude.
Miss Van Dries.
So when do we start to punish such evil?
Norman Casey Bolt, high on crack cocaine,

Do you really want to send this monster to a cot bed satellite

The defendant please stand.

Yep.
She's come in here, all bruised and beaten up,
sit at the counter, eat her ice cream,
go home to another beating.
Usual, Judge?
Yeah, thanks.
Walden, you hungry?
Uhm, no, thanks, Madge.
Just maybe a bit more coffee.
MADGE: OK.
You're still trying to break that 360?
Kindleman called me, said the court ought
to upgrade your equipment.
Go digital, make your life easier.
Yeah.
You'd never miss a word.
Speaking of which.

Dr. Foster... Mmhmm.
Mr. Walden Dean?
Can you come with me please?
Deep breath.
So I'm quite focused for long periods of the day.
How long have you been doing this job?
Have you fainted?
Fallen down?
Thrown up?
So could that be a factor?
You know what I think?
I think it is stress related.
I can give you something to relax you, if you...
Thank you, Doctor.

Please.
Stop who?
Please?
Stop her.
Excuse me, sir.

Somebody snatched my boy!
BILL: OK.
Called him to breakfast the next morning and went to his room,
Four boys have gone missing from this here
vicinity over the last eight years, mostly Mexican kids,
BILL: Now, now.
No kid is unimportant to the law, Mrs. Pepper.
That there computer Cal's?
He don't need one.
BILL: All right.
She was old.
I love that dog.
Yeah.
No, we did.
Bring my boy home.
and could be adopted by God knows who?
and God knows what else.
Walden.
Walden.
Walden, did not tell you to stop playing
with that fucking machine!
Walden?
Walden?
OK, I guess.
The dizziness I had before is gone.

DOCTOR: Yes.
What showed up was an abnormality
It's called a meningioma.
Meningioma?
I've heard that word before.
I know because we had a case...
and such.

her body in her own feces before being tased by a SWAT team.
She was understandably sectioned off
to the criminal wing of the insane asylum,
where she promptly died.
Jesus Christ.
These tumors are mostly benign.
because these fainting episodes will evolve.
You were here overnight.
Where's my steno?
Mr. Dean, hold on.
You need to take this seriously.
No, I will.
Mr. Dean, should you be here?
Why not?
Very well.
You have 60 seconds starting now.
The crime of the murder occurred during the outdoor concert
on the 1st of August 19...
Paramedics were called to the scene,
As a result, the outdoor event was immediately canceled,
and the police and the suspect apprehended...
Time.
That was impressive today.
351.
Anything inspire you to up your game?
What are you doing?
Being nosy.
A Savant?
Well, then explain yourself.
Yes.
Well, I was.
and to stave off apathy.
Your turn.
five generations of Deans have lived in Alexandria all
the way back to the Civil War.
Five generations.
Yes, it is.
It was.
Emotional?
You think that's necessary to be a court reporter?
words had a price, like actions, but sometimes
with greater consequence.
And...
Go on.
You know what?
You're right, ma'am.
You are nosy.
It's miss.
It's miss, not ma'am.
And these would be?
Mrs. Pepper was talking about.
All Mexican, all aged around 9, plus 3 more,
all disappeared within the last 10 years, no results.
Seven kids?
SALLY: Eight if you count Cal Pepper.
What?
Just read the damn file.
Daddy!
Oh, sorry I've missed the rehearsal.
I know.
WALDEN: Hi, Dad.
Walden.
Usual soda, Walden?
You don't drink.
I know.
Good health, Pop.
Whiskey's a man's drink.
Booze.
No.
Hell no.
Dad...
I left so that you could live.
You know?
such profoundly inconsistent behavior, you know?
OK.
Now, as a change of subject, I'm
What for?
JESSE: Other than a momentary wave
of hubris sweeping through, what else does it bring?
Tell me.
You.
Stop it.
Why should you?
I should... oh, evening, Miss Daisy.
Hey, Walden.
for a headache...
OK.
Hurry up! I am-
Give me the fucking money, and hurry up!
Stupid motherfucker!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
BILL: Hey, Walden.
Uhm, I feel really bad, Detective.
In my life.
He'll live to see you in court.
Not well.
as your daddy?
Your eyelashes are fake.
Why?
We are family.
Claire, don't! Claire, don't!
Claire, don't go.
I hope not.
This does not happen in small towns.
This might happen in LA.
Does this happen in LA? Yep.
See?
Is everything OK?
BILL: No.
No, everything is not OK, Walden.
Norman Casey Bolt got released today on a technicality.
WALDEN: What?
What technicality?
Brady violation.
Prosecution was supposed to turn in evidence,
So now he's a free man.
he's back at his own house.
Pembleton!
(SNAPS FINGERS) Get Walden's statement,
and if you excuse us, we have to go welcome Bolt back to town.
Thank you.
Come see my new stove, Bill?
Nah.
You know, the kids around here be needing clothes, especially
in these, uh, difficult times.
Do you feel me?
(LAUGHS) My door is always open.
Yeah, what are these going to do for me?
No.
No.
I could do that.
Bottoms up.
Hey.
You need to know that this isn't me.
let their own flesh and blood sink so
hopelessly low until this, all this became normal?
This is not normal!
And quite frankly, sir, you have to pay for that.
NORMAN: Wait, what are you fucking... no!
Hello?
Uhm, yes.
Just, uh, talking with my mouth full.
OK.
Uh, great.
Thanks.
Hey.
Uh, Bolt?
No, why?
Yeah, that sounds horrifically painful.
but I'm pretty sure Satan's got himself a new chew toy.
If you say so, Walden.
Bye, bye.
Why is everyone standing around?
It's Cal.
Shit.
What is that?
MR. PEPPER: Stop her.
Oh, shit.
Guys...
(SCREAMS) Cal!
Cal!
Cal!
(SCREAMS) Cal!
What's that?
This?
It's OK.
This is a crime scene.
PRIEST: Even though we have gathered here
to lament the passing of young Cal Pepper,
So let us...
He was murdered, Father.
and he was brutally violated, and choked to death.
for such explicit grief.
I'm sorry, where?
Where do we go?
Isn't this the Lord's house?
Why can't we lay our pain at His door?
I mean, come to me all Ye who suffer,
and I will give you comfort.
And I know eight sons who really use
His comfort right about now.
Kids love candy bars.
JUDGE BOYLE: All those kids, Lord have mercy.
at that drugstore. WALDEN: Oh, no.
It was wrong.
I shouldn't have.
It's my town, Walden.
Well...
We're going to lunch.
You're welcome to join.
Come on, honey.
After some brief deliberation on my part,
was unloaded, I think 12 months probation
should be sufficient...
Yes!
Do you hear me?
So ruled.
Well, why?
Calling you a Savant, and all.
Savant?
Great.
With what?
See, my family's throwing this party for my Uncle James,
and I cannot handle it alone.
Why not?
OK.
I know what you're doing.
I have work in the morning.
Don't worry, I'll make sure you're home before sunset.
OK.
Well, back by sunset, you say?
I promise.
Your family lives here?
Yeah, for six generations.
Beat the DEANS by one, ei?
Come on.
Let's meet the Duperon gang.
Hi.
Hi there.
Jesus. Hi!
Alexandria?
Dean?
Yes, sir.
I am.
What she do?
But let's just say...
OK. OK.
I think that's enough.
I'm sorry.
I agree, honey.
That's enough, Mitchell.
Please forgive him, dear.
Oh, no, no, no, your husband is right, Mrs. Duperon.
as one would hope.
If you'd excuse me.
for my father's ignorance?
Oh, no.
Never apologize for a truth.
You know, this house was given to my family.
Yep.
Apparently, we read the entire surrounding
Snakes.
Who said that?
Walden Dean.
Let me think, uhm.
Two most important days in your life are the day you're born...
And the day you find out why, OK.
Are you just quoting Mark Twain over there?
I didn't.
Until recently.
Another time.
It's almost sunset.
Yeah.
What?
I was just thinking, I never really
put this down for that long.
Really?
OK.
Yeah.
You broke your promise.
Good night!
BILL: Hey, George.
BILL: Hey, George.
Oh, hi, Detective Billy.
Hi.
don't you?
GEORGE: Not only that.
OK.
You seen any strange folk hanging around?
People even you've never met before?
No.
Detective Billy.
wouldn't be strangers no more.
Sure would.
SALLY: Hey, George, you knew young Cal Pepper,
didn't you, George?
I don't know nothing about what happened to Cal.
Nothing.
Hey, it's OK, George.
OK?
Thank you.
Today's court case is bad.
Bad man.
Very bad man.
You saw that candy bar, right?
Yep.
I like candy bars, too.
Anything else outstanding about Mr. Pym?
It's over.
MR. PATEL: Substantial bruising
His feet were badly deformed from what looked
DEITRICH: Heavy bandaging?
a sustained and painful treatment.
the only patient at the blessed retirement facility
to have sustained such terrible injuries?
MR. PATEL: There were whispers about the BRF,
but not much more than that.
Mills, was overseeing these patients,
slapping his father across the face
for not taking his medication?
Objection, Your Honor!
25 years of impeccable service in the medical profession,
systematically tortured his unfortunate patients who
subsequently died from nothing to do with bandaged feet
or bruised buttocks.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but defense is deflecting
from an observation of violence, which clearly lends
itself to a mode of behavior.
Ms. Deitrich, did anybody actually see
nurse Mills binding these poor people's feet
or whipping them with a...
No, Your Honor, no witnesses.
I'm sorry, but I...
Owing to Chief nurse Mills impeccable record,
or actual evidence, no eyewitnesses, no leather belt,

there's nothing wrong with me.
They're probably just trying to beat that stupid steno record.
Do yourself a favor, son, and quit that damn competition
right now.
Well, I can't.
A very nice young woman.
How about that?
Speaking of guns?
Still feels kind of weird.
Oh, yes, sir.
All right.
Are you hearing me?
Who the fuck are you?
The stenographer.
He said, "Stop her.
Oh, please?"
I feel compelled to comply with his plea.
to come clean and confess to all the years of abuse
and the unprotected.
You did devilishly murder, Mr. Pym, correct?
Good.
Boy, oh, boy, you just couldn't resist
flaunting a souvenir of the pain you caused, could you?
This one's for you.

The same, 329.
Mm, I see.
Synchronicity prevails, congratulations.
Every bone in both feet is broken.
Cotton ball in the nostrils.
Sorry.
(SIGHS) Found this in the shower.
It's covered in old bloodstains, but
there's some fresh on there.
BILL: OK.
Pym's kind of injuries.
Yeah.
SALLY: Same somebody who cooked Bolt?
Maybe you're wrong.
What?
Maybe one of them does.
It's 1888, Paris.

I like you.
Hi, Walden.
Thank you.
I love you.
I got you a gift.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Shit.
Why, George?
Get up, George.
Get up.
George, come on.
Come on.
Hi, Detective Billy.
Is everything OK?
No, George.
It's not OK.
Now we won't finish the game.
Why are you arresting me, Billy?
Don't you normally keep those handcuffs for bad people
who do bad things?
BILL: Yes.
You got to Mirandize him.
Billy, you got him Mirandized...
You have the right to an attorney.

Let's go. OK.
OK?
He was with a kid.
He's Mexican.
Cal Pepper wasn't Mexican.
SALLY: Only one who wasn't.
They were playing video games.
All those kids.
Somebody had to do something.
Well, turn this place over, and see what you find.
I'll let health services know what's going on.
This cannot get out.
If folks find out we're pulling a mentally challenged person
I need evidence, or cut him loose.
This is just silly.

I don't blame you.
But I've had enough of watching people get hurt, and die,
but I believe pain sure does.

It is not acceptable!
I'm sorry to go against you, Lord.
But damn it.
I have to do something.

we'll be having between us.

Amen.
Oh, and if you can, please have Emily Duperon forget I exist.
Thank you.
Hey, Bill.
Hey, I heard George is in holding?
Yeah.
Yeah, you heard right.
We maybe charging him for Cal Peppers' murder.
What?
George? No.
No, no, no. Surely not.
Local retard can have an evil streak?
OK.
do something like that, OK?
Plus, he's my friend.
Are you OK?
at night with the person you love,
Hey.
No.
Can I see George?
You got five minutes.
Hey, buddy.
They think maybe you have something
I would never hurt a kid, Walden.
All my friends are the local kids.
You know that.
They're the only ones that will talk to me
and don't spit on me.
you got to tell Bill.
No.
I was only 10.
like General George Custer.
I liked that name, and it stuck.
He died in battle.
OK.
This isn't my battle.
No, George.
No.
This is not your battle.
OK?
Guilty.
Guilty.
Mr. Dean, guilty or not guilty?
Answer.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where Walden Dean is?
And why I care so much?
A boy who leaves me on a date, and then
refuses to answer my calls.
OK.
This was a bad idea.
No, what... whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just...
Daddy was crying.
I heard him.
"It rained heavily this morning.
That's why I went inside.
She looked so beautiful.
But she was wearing black.
I just stood there and wondered if she was as sad as my daddy.
I was crying.
What are you doing?
These are my things.
You live with all this?
I collect the testament of justice.
No.
You collect pain and loss.
Walden, you should just throw all this away.
WALDEN: Don't.
Just please don't.
Don't...
Why?
It's tragic.
I'm... I'm the ghost of the courtroom.
I arrive.
I take out my machine, and I record
betray your emotions, right?
You look around the court like you just landed on the moon.
(SIGHS) So my fingers tap while I hear innocence,
and I hear evil.
And when it does, pack up my machine,
But you're not a ghost, Walden.
You're not a ghost.
This is all I have.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
You're not a ghost, Walden.
That's right.
That's my clever girl.
Hey, uhm, can I ask you something, darling?
Sure.
When you go see Father Gallagher
for communion practice, with all the kids, boys and girls...
Does father Gallagher ever...
Bill.
They sure are.
Yeah.
Time to rest.
God bless.
That's right.
that automatically makes him a suspect in a child's death.
My job is to catch a killer, Laurie.
Oh, OK.
And... and you do that how?
By grilling your own daughter?
that I believe is innocent, OK?
And the Peppers, Cal Peppers' family, they don't have
That breaks my heart.
But you can't let the sadness into our home.
It's heartbreaking, but you can't
I...
Bill.
What?
I'm just enjoying the evening.
Oh, come on, Walden.
No.
It's just something he said.
Every time we see George by the courtroom,
with the words, "Very bad man."
Bad man.
Very bad man.
Bill.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm here.
we had involved a man.
Sorry, Bill.
Walden.
Shit.
Stop fighting.
Fuck.
You just ruined a really nice party.
Maybe.
Oh, really?
GEORGE: You look sad, Detective Billy.
Did something happen?
It's Walden.
He's been hurt.
BILL: Let's hope so.
Detective?
Yeah, George?
Would it be OK if I showed you something bad?
I know you can hear me, son.
I want you to ignore what I said before at the bar,
you understand?
Words really do matter because...
Because I have a great power.
I love you, Walden.
No matter what you've done.
You're not wasting our time, are you, George?
No.
Not wasting your time.
Look, I know this sounds naive, but I trust him.
GEORGE: We're getting very close, Detective Billy.
SALLY: OK.
One out.
Let's go.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
George.
George.
Inside.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
Walk. Walk.
All right.
All right, George?
Don't move.
Yeah.
Detective Hunt?
What?
You'll never be the same.
BILL: Jesus Christ.
Fucking hell.
(CRYING) No.
How's she doing?
Go to his house and play video games.
where, uh, they'd sometimes going to get paid.
Paid?
For what?
Jesus Christ!
Bill?
Dad?
Found your way home, huh?
Hey now.
Atta boy.
Dad?
Yeah?
Every day.
WALDEN: Yeah.
Well, no rush, son.
No samba classes.
Fleming.
Jesse?
See better than me?
Now you know there'd be incriminating.
All right.
I could use a little exercise.
Take care, son.
Come on.
Good to see you you're in your pop back under the same roof.
Yeah.
It's a beauty.
You mind?
Yeah.
your head cracked open to come to your senses
about that competition.
Hey, how's that girl?
New girl you told me about?
Yeah.
Well, I'll message you, son.
Yes, sir.
Well, just exercising my constitutional
right to self-defense, Pop.
You're talking kind of funny.
You're funny, boy.
Don't miss.
Don't be long.
I won't.
Sit down, Walden.
Have your hands remain visible, please?
What gave me away?
The torn fabric in your car seat.
Dammit.
We judges can fuck up, do some terrible things.
That's putting it rather mildly.
He did, indeed.
and dump his body in the forest.
I'm curious.
What makes someone want to do something like that?
The need to...
They smell good.
They walk like foals.
I've always had it.
And I needed your pop in my courtroom.
I couldn't have him distracted.
How many?
I started when I was 17.
Countless.
Endless.
And Mrs. Boyle?
My sweet facade.
My lily-white camouflage.
She has no idea.
You won't need that gun.
I'm done.
your avuncular nature towards me,
And since you are such a wicked man,
for the children.
For the children.
Fair enough.
have ever seen in a courtroom.
Hi, detectives.
BILL: Hey, Walden.
Come on in.
Thanks for keeping it down, detectives.
No.
No, it hasn't been outlawed.
OK.
Thanks for asking, Walden.
Yeah.
They say it was self-defense.
It was self-defense.
But witnesses?
Caring bystanders.
but...
That's right.
Yeah, man.
That is a mystery.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
all those crazy thoughts, and those crazy things,
You following me?
We'll see ourselves out, Walden.
Well.
Corpus Christi.
Amen.
PRIEST: Corpus Christi.
KID: Amen.
Congratulations.
So proud of you.
Time.
(SIGHS) 359, I believe.
359?
Shit.
You were two away from the world record.

is alleged to have murdered seven different prostitutes
across the state.
